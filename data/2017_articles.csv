He is HIV positive, lost his parents at the age of three and his eyesight at the age of eight because of wrong medication. He was living with his aunt, but she did not want him. At this point, Jerryl Hughes came in Mehul’s life who decided to look after him, to which his aunt agreed. And this changed his life for better. Life of Jerryl, who is from the United States, changed after he was diagnosed with HIV. This prompted him to work for the people afflicted with the disease. He started Hughes Foundation at Nagpur in 2004 to spread awareness about the disease and works for HIV affected children along with his partners Sanjay Patil and Khemraj Meshram. Some HIV affected children are also staying with him now.On January 1 this year, the foundation turned a 2BHK house — 66, Mecosabagh, Christian Colony — into a ‘House of Hope’. This house is a special home for HIV affected children between the ages of five and 18. It will be officially inaugurated today, on Republic Day. “I want to raise these kids, educate them and make them healthy people,” he says. But why choose Nagpur? “There are 3,000 children living with HIV in this city,” says Jerryl.Damini Raghuvanishi, 11, is also HIV positive, along with her mother. Her parents are labourers from Madhya Pradesh, living in Pahadi area. Damini’s father is an alcoholic. “Her mother couldn’t effectively raise her three children. When we showed her our hostel, she was willing to send Damini here,” says Patil, programme officer of the foundation, adding, “The four children who stay with us have either lost one or both parents.” “We encourage children to stay with their families. Affected kids from the neighbourhood come every afternoon between 1pm and 3.30pm to play,” adds Jerryl.At the hostel, there are bunk beds, food and sanitation facilities, and one full-time caretaker who does housekeeping, cooks and administers medicines to the inmates. “I’m myself HIV positive,” says caretaker Pradnya Manjhewar, adding, “When my relatives came to know that my daughter and I were affected, they threw us out of the house. Now I live with my kid at the hostel.” A part-time house maid also visits and doctor for HIV is called to visit monthly. The foundation also wants to buy a fridge and a TV, but they need donations, says Meshram, the community director of the foundation. "

The PIP is part of a collaboration between the state prison department, Assam State Aids Control Society (ASACS), National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and Emmanuel Hospital Association, which is acting as an implementing body for PIP along with the state prison department.The PIP aims to bring various established HIV/AIDS intervention programmes at the state level closer to those lodged in central and district jails. ""We don't know how many HIV-positive inmates are lodged in Assam's jails. We have just started the project. We will counsel them and integrate them with intervention programmes,"" said Rebecca of EHA.It will help HIV-positive inmates get access to free counselling and medicines. Once rolled out, the PIP will be replicated in all the jails of Assam. The PIP aims to provide oral/opiod substitution therapy (OST) to drug addicts lodged in prisons. Assam is the last state in the northeast where PIP has been launched. Last year, it was launched at jails of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya.The PIP project is a part of Project Sunshine - a five-year initiative to raise awareness and start intervention programmes for AIDS-affected people in the northeast.""We cannot take HIV-positive inmates to hospitals outside the jail. Through PIP, we will bring mobile integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) to the prisons. In prisons, it is seen that there are HRG people like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and others. The PIP will aim at fostering communication and bring the vulnerable people closer to intervention programmes and correct the HRG inmates' behavioural pattern,"" said Kailash Ditya, deputy team leader, Project Sunrise.Project Sunshine is supported by the USA-based federal agency centres for disease control and prevention and implemented by Family Health International 360, a global non-profit development organisation.

Synthetic drugs presently used for HIV treatment have side effects. Researchers hope that since the molecule taken from Aerva lanata is natural, it may not have any negative impact.“We have suggested that medical universities and major research institutions conduct clinical research on our laboratory finding to corroborate the results in patients as we cannot do tests on human beings,“ said Dr Estari Mamidala, one of the researchers.The roots of the weed have been in use by tribals in the forests of Khammam fro ages.Tribals have been using the plant for a number of bacterial and viral diseases. “We collected the weed from jungles as part of the ethnomedical research and found it effective in fighting HIV. In fact, tribals have been using the plant for people with HIV-like symptoms,“ Dr Estari told TOI.Dr Estari along with Dr Rajendra Prasad Gujjeti published the lab results in the latest issue of the Pharmacognosy Journal.“The extracts of Aerva la nata showed inhibitory activity on HIV. The results are remarkable and can be used to develop a new drug for HIV treatment or other infectious diseases caused by the pathogenic micro-organisms, for which plant sterols may play a distinctive role,“ Dr Estari said. He said further work is in progress to evaluate the active compound obtained from the weed. “It has the potential to inhibit the enzyme called HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). The highest inhibition was 91%.The least percentage of inhibition was 77.5%. This is as against the anti-HIV drug, which showed 91.7% efficacy,“ he said.He said the plant contains certain phytochemical compounds that make it a potential future drug for HIV. It has substantial medicinal merit. The plant also helps in lowering blood cholesterol levels. The active compound can also provide molecules which could be useful for the synthesis of new broad spectrum antibiotics for treatment of various infections, besides battling HIV ."

The move is expected to benefit many of the over 21 lakh people estimated to be living with HIV in India. Moreover, viral hepatitis has also been recognised as a serious public health problem in India by the World Health Organisation (WHO) with a total of over 52 million people infected with chronic hepatitis in the country. Out of this, 40 million people in India are chronically infected with Hepatitis B and 6 to 12 million people are chronically infected with Hepatitis C, latest assessment by the UN agency shows.The regulator has also allowed leeway to manufacturers for conducting clinical trials or bio-equivalence studies in India. While these studies are conducted to test new drugs on local patients, they take a long time and hence often delays launches in the country.The new norms issued by the regulator allows companies to apply for such studies and product approvals simultaneously, whereas usually companies have to submit data from trials before seeking product approvals.In fact, in some cases the regulator has also suggested waiving off clinical trials for urgent use. ""Clinical trial waiver for such products recommended by WHO for concomitant use may be given, as being falling under the category of extreme urgency and under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules,"" it said.Though India has demonstrated a 57% reduction in overall annual number of new HIV cases, it continues to have the third highest number of people living with HIV in the world. Similarly, chronic Hepatitis is placing a huge disease, social and economic burden on affected families as well as the health system. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to liver fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer.Early approvals in India are also likely to benefit people around the world as India is a major supplier of generic medicines, mainly anti-retroviral."

This is the third occasion on which the convict has raised the issue of remission before jail authorities. When his application was not considered for the first time, he moved the high court which directed the jail authorities and the state government to take a decision on the issue within stipulated time.However, officials did not take any decision on the convict’s representation. The convict made applications twice again, but failed to get any response. This led him to move the HC once again.After issuing notice to the state government and the jail superintendent , Justice J B Pardiwala has kept further hearing in June.Thirty-three persons, mostly women and children, were burnt alive in a room locked from outside by a violent mob in north Gujarat village of Sardarpura on March 1, 2002. In 2011, a special SIT court convicted 31 persons and handed down life imprisonment to them. Last year, Gujarat high court upheld conviction for 17 persons, whereas it acquitted 14 others."

In fact, the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) has increased by seven percent in the last one year.According to official data, Telangana recorded 11,846 new cases of HIV AIDS during 2016. The total population of PLHIV in the state stands at 1,73,398 as on January 1, 2017 as against 1,61,552 cases in 2015.About 1,000 new cases of HIVAIDS, are reported every month in the state.Hyderabad has 33 per cent of people living with HIV.The most common route of transmission of the virus is through heterosexual activity, reveals the official data obtained through a right to information (RTI) query posed by the Helping Hand Foundation (HHF).As many as 55,319 peo ple living with HIV have registered at the three centres in Hyderabad for anti-retroviral therapy.The centres are Osmania General Hospital (28807), Gandhi General Hospital (13,938) and Government Chest Hospital (12,574). After Hyderabad, Khammam district has the highest population of PLHIV (14,361), followed by Mahbubnagar (13,911), Nalgonda (13,745), Warangal (12,936), Sangareddy (10,995) and Nizamabad (10,726).Quoting official data, HHF president Mujtaba Hasan Askari said Telangana recorded 11,846 new cases of HIVAIDS during 2016. With this, the total PLHIV population in the state has increased to 1,73,398 (Pre ART2016).“This is an increase of seven per cent in the HIV AIDS cases during 2016 over the previous year (2015). But, if the data prior to 2015 is taken into account, one cannot deduce whether the burden of the disease has increased or decreased as it pertained to undivided state. At an average, 950 to 1,000 new cases of HIVAIDS were reported every month during 2016,“ he said.Askari said the total HIVAIDS burden in Telangana seemed to be underestimated. “We found discrepancy between the numbers shared by Telangana State AIDS Control Society (TSACS) and the data obtained from ART centres. TSACS officials claimed that the difference could be on account of transfers to ART Link centres or ART Plus centres,“ he said.The Foundation also conducted a detailed field level survey across the state and submitted the findings to the project director of TSACS. He said the TSACS did not share data on HIV-TB co-infection in the state. Incidentally, the mortality due to TB in HIV cases is very high."

He was diagnosed with HIV in 2014. While life changed after his diagnosis, he was at least thankful of having a stable job at the front desk of a private hotel. But fate and prejudice intervened the day his manager saw the AIDS Control Society card on his desk. The next day he was asked to quit. “I even attempted suicide three times. I could not find a job, finally an NGO offered me a job as counsellor,“ he said.Ramesh is not isolated in trauma. A survey conducted in Telangana revealed that 93% people living with AIDS face stigma at workplaces, in their neighbourhoods and even at hospitals. This has forced several of them to travel long distances to reach Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres.The survey, carried out by city-based Helping Hands Foundation, began in mid-February and covered 26 ART centres. The team interviewed 561 patients across the state, 182 of whom were from Hyderabad, to find that 93% of them faced discrimination at their places of work and while accessing healthcare or getting rented accommodation in case they disclose their HIV-positive status.ART counsellors and medical experts were also interviewed.The survey also exposed exploitation by private hospitals.As many as 60% of the respondents said that private hospitals make them pay through the nose for treatment. In case they choose to go to a government hospital, they are met with hesitance. This is why most HIV patients prefer to keep their identities guarded. As many as 55% of the respondents withheld their names for fear of discrimination and only shared their ART registration number in the survey.What's worse is that 25% reported facing discrimination at ART centres too. They said they faced problems in collecting medicines and had to put up with rude behaviour of staff. The stigma is so high that 54% said they went to ART centres far away from their homes for fear of being exposed in their own neighbourhoods.Most patients also discard medicine boxes just outside ART centres to ensure they are not identified."

It was passed by the Rajya Sabha on March 21.The bill assumes significance as it protects people living with HIV from specific acts of discrimination by the state, or any other person. It also lays down penal provisions for any discrimination practised against a person with HIV/AIDS and breach of confidentiality.Under the new law, central and state governments are obliged to provide for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and management of opportunistic infections (infections that take advantage of weakness in the immune system and occur frequently).The protection mandated under the law extends to the fields of employment, healthcare services, educational services, public facilities, property rights, holding public office and insurance.“It is not the case that before coming of this bill, these people (infected with HIV ) were not empowered but with its passage, they will get more powers,” Nadda said.The total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at 21.17 lakh.Around 86000 new HIV infections were reported in 2015, showing a 66% decline in new infections from 2000.In 2015, around 68000 people died of AIDS-related causes nationally. Though the bill was initially introduced in Parliament by the UPA government, the amendments to the legislation were revived by the Modi government in July 2016.Since then the health ministry has made various changes to the original bill to address several concerns raised by the the HIV community as well as state governments."

Nearly onethird of PLHIV in Telangana reside in Hyderabad and unscientific administration of drugs will complicate the fight against HIV and Aids.According to HIV rights activists in the city, while antiretroviral treatment is scientifically proved, homoeopathic drugs for HIV are yet to be medically tested. About 1,000 people with HIVAids from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are now treated by homoeopaths at the government JSPS College of Homeopathy in Hyderabad. “It is a cause of concern that homoeopathic medicines are given without a scien tific backing,“ said Mujtaba Hasan Askari of Helping Hand Foundation (HHF). He told STOI that the HHF recently conducted a survey in Telangana and found that homoeopathic drugs are prescribed to people with HIV and Aids.“About 1,000 HIVAids cases from Telangana and other states have taken recourse to alternative medicine (homoeopathy). The homoeopathy drugs are given free of cost every Monday and Thursday at the JSPS College of Homeopathy between 9.30am and 1.30pm in a well-organised camp on the sprawling hospital premises at Ramanthapur,“ Askari said expressing fears that drugs not backed by sound clinical trials may only aggravate the problem and increase the burden of disease. “This is a disaster in waiting,“ he added.Doctors warn that if antiretroviral (ARV) therapy is discontinued there is a high risk of resistance to first line ARV drugs. This will be difficult to diagnose and treat the disease. Only a few trained clinicians can diagnose ARV first line resistance and only a small number of ART plus centres can administer second line treatment to HIVAids cases. He said though homoeopathy drugs are given free of cost, the patients are referred to diagnostic centres to get their CD4 count tested. Those with HIV and Aids are forced to spend money on diagnostic tests while similar tests are conducted free of cost in government hospitals and designated ART centres."

Many kids in the orphanage are HIV infected and the irony can't be missed as the NGO, AGAPE, boldly carries a tagline - Caring for AIDS Orphans.Manual scavenging is banned in India and police took cognizance of the video to lodge a criminal case against the NGO warden, Prajavathi.The video was made available by AP Balala Hakkula Sangam to Rachakonda commissioner Mahesh Bhagwath, “A case has been lodged under Section 14 of Child Labour Act, 1986, and Section 73 of JJ Act at Uppal police station against the warden.

In a research conducted by MSc students Heeral Ingle, Shreya Mallya, Juveria Qureshi and Vrishti Shah, 98 of the 120 respondents said a person can contract HIV by sharing a glass of water with an infected person. Also, only four of the respondents were aware that rashes, sores or cuts in mouth, on nose and genitals or under the skin are symptoms of HIV. The students interviewed 30 couples and 60 single men and women through a knowledge questionnaire to understand how aware they are about HIV. Research guide Dr Kamini Rege said, “We selected the sample ensuring equal gender representation. The research findings led us to believe that there is a need to create awareness about HIV/AIDS, so we made brochures that illustrate the causes, symptoms and treatment, along with providing the helpline numbers.”"
26,4,2017,THE NATARAJA WHO MADE PERINI SHIVATANDAVAM HIS LIFE’S PURPOSE,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/news/the-nataraja-who-made-perini-shivatandavam-his-lifes-purpose/articleshow/58422128.cms,"A dance guru, scholar and musicologist par excellence, late Nataraja Ramakrishna needs no introduction. How he revived Perini Shivatandavam, the 700-year-old dance form of Telangana, is stuff of legend. Hailing from a well-to-do family, he thrust aside affluence to pursue his passion — dance. How the legend faced his father’s wrath, discarded his family name, embraced poverty and became one of the most revered dance scholars in the country, makes for a fascinating story.He chose dance over familyBorn in Bali to Ramamohan Rao and Damayanthi Devi on March 21, 1923, Ramakrishna was the middle child among three siblings. His love for dance began early in life after witnessing a temple dancer perform in his native village as an eight year old. Though his mother was a proficient singer, veena exponent and a poet, his father didn’t approve of his fondness for dance. But young Ramakrishna was adamant. To protect him from his father’s ire, his elder brother Shyamsundar took him away to Sri Kalahasti at the age of 14 and put him under the tutelage of Nayudupeta Rajamma, an old Devadasi dancer. He mastered the art that was dying because Devadasi tradition was outlawed.When his father found that Ramakrishna had not mended his ways, he was sent back to the Ramakrishna Mutt in Madras to wean him away from dancing. But there again his devotion to dance led Ramakrishna in search of another teacher. He went to Pandanallur to train under Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, but she had nothing much to offer than the ones he has already mastered. When his father learnt that sending him off to Ramakrishna Mutt did not put dance off his mind, he sent Ramakrishna, now matriculate, to Nagpur for higher education, but there again the determined dancer didn’t stop searching for new avenues to master the art.How Ramakrishna became NatarajaBut thankfully, Ramakrishna’s virtuosity in dance found a patron in Raja Ganapati Rao Pandya, the prince of Bhandara Samsthan. He was summoned to dance before the prince in a court full of artisans. That performance earned him the epithet, ‘Nataraj’ that went on to become his family name. There is an interesting anecdote about how Nataraja became his adopted family name. “Before he got patronage of the Bhandara zamindar, Ramakrishna’s life was a struggle. He had no place to go, no one to look after. His father who came to see him gave him ample money and asked him to come back home and live in plenty — but he has to leave his dance completely. He left his money on the table. Ramakrishna went to his father the next day and returned the money. His father was so angry that he said that if he were a man, he would never use the family name and never refer to his parents publicly. Ramakrishna obliged his father and never used his family name,” wrote dance critic Prof Sharma in a tribute piece.The three years he spent in the court of Raja Ganapati Rao Pandya were rewarding. He was revered, honoured and appreciated. But everything looked like a mirage to him. He wanted to go back to his native state and nourish the classical traditions of Andhra that were in dormant state.He played a stellar role in helping Kuchipudi gain classical statusRamakrishna is a name synonymous with Perini Shivatandavam, but his contribution to Kuchipudi and Andhra Natyaam cannot be overlooked. After he traced his steps back to his native state, he started working on revial and exposure of Andhra art traditions. “When Kuchipudi was denied classical status, Ramakrishna, the then spokesman of State Sangeet Natak Akademi decided to organise the historic All India Dance Seminar on Kuchipudi and other classical dance traditions of Andhra. Experts from all over India attended the seminar. The effort was also to promote Kuchipudi as the cultural identity of the newly formed state of Andhra,” says Anuradha Jonnalagadda, a Kuchipudi exponent and a disciple of Ramakrishna. Ramakrishna, the convenor of the festival demonstrated the richness of the dance form. This seminar gave Kuchipudi the much deserved national recognition.Reviving the devadasi traditionDuring his stay with Nayudupeta Rajamma, he realised that the abhinaya school is on the verge of extinction. After an extensive research in ancient dance traditions, he started writing on the dance traditions of Andhra. In an effort to revive Andhra’s lasya tradition, he along with Annabathula Buli Venkataratnamma went door-to- door in search of a Devadasi performer who remembered the tradition. He found 16 performers, brought them on one platform and organised a lecture series, Abhinaya Sadassu, in 1970 at Rajahmundry. He didn’t stop at that. He reconstructed oral texts belonging to Agama, Kucheri and Bhagavata traditions and made few of his talented disciples undergo rigorous training of the art. To do away with the stigma of Devadasi system, it was decided that the dance form will be renamed as Andhra Natyam. Ramakrishna was instrumental in its accreditation at the university level.Stumbling into ‘Prerana’ and giving birth to Perini“While going through Jayapa Senani’s Nritta Ratnavali, he noticed the mention of a ‘prerana’ dance, performed only by men to invoke Lord Shiva. He did his research on agama texts, re-conceptualised the textual evidence of the dance form from Jayapa Senani’s Bharataarnavam and Nritta Ratnavali, Sarangadeva’s Sangeeta Ratnakara and Sarvanga Bhoopala Yechendra’s Sabharanjani, studied the temple sculptures of Telangana, along with the his vast knowledge of various dance forms, he revived Prerana as Perini,” says Kala Krishna, another disciple of the Perini revivalist. Ramakrishna emphasised that the dance be performed on music that is in sync with the wartime mood. “He developed a specific style of playing mridangam thatshaped the movement of the dance. Unfortunately we don’t have the mridangam players now. After Dhupam Suryalingam who had equal contribution in revival of Perini, it was his disciple, Balarama Moorthy who used to play the instrument. Now without a mridangam player we perform only on recorded music,” laments Kala Krishna.Nataraja Ramakrishna—a name not recognisedDespite his contributions, Ramakrishna did not get the recognition he deserves. Voicing his discontentment Kala Krishna says, “The Telangana government is trying to make Perini the dance form of Telangana. It was incorporated in curriculum as a part of Andhra Natyam, but since the last two months it is being studied as a separate subject. But the government has not bestowed upon him the honours and recognition he deserved. Isn’t it unfair to recognise a work but not the name behind it!”"
27,5,2017,Insurance a mirage for poor HIV positives,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/insurance-a-mirage-for-poor-hiv-positives/articleshow/58466442.cms,"For 45-year-old Siriyapushpam, a daily wage labourer who earns `100 a day, falling ill costs her dear. The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day’s wage to travel to a government hospital in Tambaram. At times when the prescribed medicine is unavailable at the hospital, she has to buy the same from outside at a steeper price. While a weak immune system and lack of a nutritious diet make Siriyapushpam susceptible to frequent bouts of illnesses, she says meeting the increasing medical expense gets harder for her each time. Siriyapushpam’s case is not isolated. A complete absence of insurance cover against opportunistic infections (infections caused due to a weak immune system), affects more than 21 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the country, including 1.42 lakh in TN.It has been more than a month since the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2014 came into place, but insurers say, they are yet to get guidelines on including such patients in health, life and critical illness segments. The Act protects PLHIV against denial, termination, discontinuation and unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property, standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance. But without specific instructions, PLHIV in the country remain without cover.According to ‘India HIV Estimation 2015’ report of National AIDS Control Organisation, there were 21.17 lakh PLHIV, including 86,000 newly infected people in 2015. With the highest prevalence being recorded in Nagaland (1.29%), TN’s prevalence rate (0.27%) was higher than the national average of 0.26%.""I have seen cases where hospitals have refused to conduct surgeries to remove uterine fibroids on HIV positive persons. Others charge two to three times the actual cost to operate. If an insurance scheme is introduced for PLHIV, there would be some regulation,"" Kousalya Periasamy, founder of NGO Positive Women’s Network. According to a 2006 UNDP study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India, a person with HIV bears expenses between `25,000 - `30,000 a year. The situation is worse if the earning member in a family is frequently hospitalised.HIV/AIDS and related complications are excluded from critical insurance covers and insurers say they haven’t received instructions to include it in their policies. Health insurance for groups, however, exists. ""In the group health segment, Cigna TTK offers AIDS/HIV cover up to full sum insured under the global health group policy. It covers Indian locals and expatriates working abroad under one umbrella. This cover is available for employees, dependent spouse and children,"" says Sandeep Patel, CEO and MD, Cigna TTK Health Insurance.Star Health &amp; Allied Insurance provides group cover under the NetPlus policy where the proposal has to come from NGOs or government agencies. However, expenses for HIV treatment are excluded as are people with low CD4 count.""Only if companies take the initiative and insure PLHIV for frequent hospitalisations and opportunistic infections can insurance create an impact and gain public trust,"" says Dr S Prakash, senior executive director, Star Health and Allied Insurance. Others say the new law is a step in the right direction. ""With more such steps and availability of more data to enable pricing of products, we can look towards greater inclusion,"" says Ashish Mehrotra, MD and CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance.But for rural households, 72% of who, according to a 2014 NSSO study, rely on private hospitals for treatment, retail insurance continues to be a dream. Dr Sathish Kumar, country doctor for Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India said cover for PLHIV from lower income groups particularly need attention. Presently, the collective gets such PLHIV enrolled in the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). Under the scheme, PLHIV from BPL families can get free hospitalisation up to ₹30,000 per family per year. While increasing medical expenses burn a hole in their pockets, patients say unavailability of medicines at ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) centres forces them to make additional trips to the health centre, which robs them of their day’s income.Nutrition is another aspect which seems to have been brushed aside. Dr P Kuganathan, a former programme officer of the state AIDS control programme and consultant (community medicine &amp; infectious disease) at SIMS Hospital says, ""Medicines will work only if PLHIV take nutritious meals,"" adding that the Centre should implement a scheme similar to the mid-day meal for PLHIV.In December 2013, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) announced that people with HIV or other pre-existing illnesses would need to pay a higher premium for life insurance. It also urged companies to continue insuring individuals who contract HIV after buying the policy. This was two months after it issued draft guidelines asking insurers to provide life cover to HIV/AIDS patients.A lot remains to be done, especially in health insurance. At present, an individual with critical injuries or illnesses such as paralysis or cancer is more likely to getting insurance cover than an HIV positive patient on ART."

The HC said that it was state's responsibility to keep the child alive.The woman then approached the Supreme Court and the bench said she should not undergo further suffering and directed for her to be examined at AIIMS. It directed AIIMS to constitute a medical board to examine the woman latest by May 6 to find out whether she should be allowed to terminate her pregnancy.

It directed that a representative from NGO Koshish should accompany the woman, who is staying in a shelter home, ‘Shanti Kutir’ in Patna, and bring her to Delhi. It also directed the additional solicitor generals P S Narasimha and Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, to arrange for her travel and that of the representative accompanying her. The court asked both the law officers to assist the court on the issue and also hold discussion with the doctors, saying, “We are concerned with saving a life of a destitute woman.” When the matter was taken up for hearing, the bench asked advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the woman, to ask her whether she was inclined to come to Delhi, to which she replied in the affirmative. The apex court said it would not go into the Patna high court order which had held that the medical board’s report has stated that it would be unsafe for the life of the petitioner and there was a compelling responsibility of the state to keep the child alive. The high court had said the woman’s pregnancy had crossed the legal embargo of 20 weeks under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 and was unsafe to medically terminate her pregnancy. Grover said the high court had failed to appreciate that the woman was 35 years of age and completely fit to make her own reproductive choices without any interference. In her plea, the woman said she was a destitute and had come to know about her pregnancy for the first time around the 13th week and that, too, after she was rescued by Shanti Kutir, a women’s rehabilitation centre, and made to take a pregnancy test on January 26. The woman said she had expressed her desire to terminate her pregnancy on March 4 to a research officer of Koshish, a field action project of Tata Institute of Social Sciences, with whom she was in contact. However, it was only after she revealed to the superintendent of the shelter home that the pregnancy was the outcome of rape, she made attempts to have it terminated at the Patna Medical College and Hospital on March 14. According to the plea, the hospital refused to admit the woman owing to lack of identity proof. To terminate her pregnancy, she approached the high court which constituted a medical board to examine her. The board submitted its report on March 17 which said that termination would involve surgical process which may lead to health complications such as bleeding, anaesthesia hazard and sepsis. In her appeal before the apex court, the woman said her father and husband, who have deserted her, in their respective replies before the high court, had conveyed their consent for termination of pregnancy of the petitioner.

30,5,2017,‘Dominic made me promise that I would work for PLHIV as a lawyer’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dominic-made-me-promise-that-i-would-work-for-plhiv-as-a-lawyer/articleshow/58541852.cms,"What prompted you to take up Dominic’s case? How tough was the fight at the time?Dominic D’souzas’ was the first case on HIV to come to the Indian courts. It was a very tough fight because the stigma surrounding HIV was all pervasive. Moreover, most people did not understand the nature of HIV. Practically, everybody assumed that one could get HIV by mere association with a person living with HIV (PLHIV). If I recall, the arguments took about three days, about two days on my part and nearly three quarters of a day on the part of the government. The judges had to be made to understand not only the legalities, but the nature of HIV as it was then understood.The case revolved around the Goa Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1985, which permitted the government to mandatorily, without consent, test a person suspected of HIV and on being so found, an individuals’ confidentiality would be breached in addition to possible isolation and incarceration. This is what I called the isolationist law. We actually lost the case because the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the amendment except for a partial ‘reading down’, in that the Court allowed the person who was being tested to show by other tests that the person was indeed not HIV positive. This had a very deleterious effect initially as we thought the isolationist law would take root in India. However, Dominic D’souza and I, and other friends and comrades were able to resist the replication of the isolationist law of the Goa model in other parts of the country, which was attempted by the central government. In that we were able to create a certain momentum which inured to the benefit of the PLHIV movement. In fact, Dominic D’souza became the first PLHIV activist not only in India, but in the region.How significant was the judgement at the time and what ripple effect did it create?When I met Dominic in his last days in Breach Candy hospital, Mumbai, he virtually, in his usual diplomatic way, extracted a promise from me that I shall work for PLHIV community as a lawyer. This ‘tryst with Dominic’ became an obsession with me from 1992-1997, which resulted in the very famous judgement of the Bombay High Court, Mx v. ZY. This landmark judgement, delivered by Justice Tipnis, for the first time provided for the recruitment of PLHIVs in the state sector. Justice Tipnis held that if the person was otherwise qualified (such as having a diploma, degree, etc), was functionally fit and he did not pose a significant risk of transmission to others in the environment, then HIV could not be the basis of any discrimination from him being recruited in the public sector.Did Dominic’s case in some way pave the way for the Supreme Court’s verdict to decriminalize Section 377?The success in the MX v. ZY in 1997 put Lawyers Collective’s HIV work on the map such that a lot of gay people started coming to our office. On looking at the situation of gay men the conclusion was inevitable that Sextion 377 of the IPC was a cause of a lot of gay men’s woes in terms of law. This persuaded us to mount a challenge to 377, which was ultimately done in the Delhi high court successfully in 2011, but unfortunately we faced defeat in the Supreme Court, in 2013. The curative petition is still pending in the Supreme Court.Has Dominic's case also played a big role in the passing of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill 2017?Indeed, Dominic D’souza’s case was the first of many, which laid the roadmap of the now HIV Act. The HIV Act contains what we argued in Dominic D’souza’s case in Goa, such as, no testing without informed consent (Section 5), no discrimination or isolation (Section 3) and no breach of confidentiality (Section 8).How far has India come when it comes to its treatment of persons living with HIV? And how much more is left to be done? India has come a long way in treating PLHIV. However, there is a long way to go. We have to remember that India is the pharmacy of the developing and, partly, of the developed world. From 2000 onwards HIV ART triple combination therapy was supplied by India generic companies around the world, though this therapy ART was available from 1996 onwards in the West. However, we were able to supply that in India from the government sector only in 2004, despite the fact that it was Indian generic companies who were supplying ART to the rest of the developing world. Earlier, one had to reach the level of CD4 count of 350 to be on first line ART, it was then changed to 500 and now, the moment you are tested you are to be treated with ART. India, has now taken a policy decision to test and treat as soon as the person is detected to be HIV positive, which was recently announced by Union minister of health J P Nadda. Though this has been announced, India is still far away from the goal, we don’t even comply with the CD4 500 regime till now. Moreover, the HIV Act, which has been recently passed in a cause for concern because under Section 14 of the HIV Act, a caveat is introduced by providing that treatment services would be provided ‘as far as possible’. It appears to many, including the PLHIV community, that ‘as far as possible’ is an escape route for the government to evade its obligations to the community. Though it’s a concern we still have to wait and watch whether it actually becomes a problem in the future."

He was delivering a public lecture on demystifying HIV &amp; AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill 2017 at the International Centre, Goa organised by the Lawyers Collective and Positive People in anticipation of the latter’s 25th anniversary.In cases of discrimination in healthcare, a PLHIV can first complain to the establishment’s complaints authority to bring the problem to its notice and get it rectified, he says. If this doesn’t work, a PLHIV can approach an ombudsman appointed by the state government under this act to inquire into complaints of discrimination and provision of healthcare services where he/she is expected to pass orders within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint in medical emergency cases. A state must appoint at least one ombudsman.There is also no reason why insurance premium should be double for PLHIV, Grover says, pointing out that the denial or unfair treatment in providing insurance also amounts to discrimination, provided this is supported by actuarial studies.The act also requires that no person be compelled to disclose his HIV status except with his informed consent and if required by a court order where establishments maintaining records of HIV positive persons must adopt data protection measures. Grover who fought for the rights of Dominic D’Souza, one of India’s first HIV activists and the first case that went to court more than two-and-a-half decades ago, says this new act originated in D’Souza’s fight. Positive People set up by D’Souza in Goa to work for people infected with HIV completes 25 years this month."

It asked the Centre to make all arrangements to shift her to Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science at Patna where she would be treated.Noting that crucial time was wasted as the woman had to fight a legal battle to seek permission to abort the fetus, it decided to frame guidelines for government authorities and courts to take a quick decision on such pleas.The court rapped the state government for opposing her plea in the Patna HC which refused to allow her to abort and it was too late by the time she approached the apex court.The bench said there was a fault on the part of the state government and Patna Medical College and Hospital and it was because of them that she was denied her right to undergo abortion. It agreed to hear plea to direct the state to award her compensation for negligence on its part and the hospital which insisted her to get approval of her father. The court took a strong view against the state government for opposing her plea for abortion in HC.Read this story in Bengali "

A FIR was filed on May 5.“There have been cases of sexual harassment in the home and there were reports in the local media that some children might have got infected with HIV. Hence, we have decided to check if any child is infected with HIV. There are 77 children at the home and the HIV tests will be carried out at the Sassoon General Hospital,” said Anita Wipat, chairperson, CWC.While the case was reported in 2015, the children were produced in front of Juvenile Justice Board this month. Asked what led to the delay, Wipat said, “Police officials investigating the case need to produce the children in front of the juvenile justice board. Superintendent of the house should also have followed it up with the police. There was lapse from both sides.”Wipat further said that a showcause notice has been issued to staff members working at Shivajinagar Children’s Home about the delay in the case of 2015 sexual abuse. “It was the duty of the staff members at the home to follow up on the case but they didn’t do it. We have issued a showcause notice regarding the same,” said Wipat.Rajendra Mokashi, senior police inspector at Shivajinagar Police Station, said, “The officer who was looking into the case in 2015 has been transferred. Our priority is to investigate the case first. Simultaneously, we will also investigate why there was a two year delay and who all are responsible.”Another police official said, “The problem is that either the children are not aware of what is going on or have got used to the abuse. There needs to be proper counselling of these children because what we are seeing is extremely alarming.”"

Finally, he legally fought his way out 64 days later. On release, he lost his job but chose not to play the victim. Instead, he became India’s first HIV-positive activist.Goa became a centre of AIDS activism with Dominic setting up Positive People, an NGO for the rights of the HIV-infected. Isabel de Santa-Rita Vaz, his friend who’d rallied around him and continued his mission with Positive People, recounts: “His agony was unbearable for us. Dominic knew it wouldn’t be possible to achieve total freedom from infection but wanted to start an organisation that could combat discrimination.”Although he won a partial victory at first when the state amended the Goa Public Health Act and court made detention optional, Dominic lost his life three years on, at 33. “Dominic lived with AIDS, but he lived not to be ashamed,” read his obituary in Goa’s newspapers in 1992, in keeping with his wishes. “He is survived by his twin brother who lives in Sweden, a sister in Mombasa and another brother in the US,” says Vaz.Today, there are an estimated 2.1 million HIV-positive persons in India. Even though diagnosis is no more a death sentence but a chronic illness for which medicines are easier to access, and one can live longer, regular lives, the challenges are many. The stigma it carries and its association with homosexuality, drug use and sex work still impedes the shift in people’s attitudes, says Vaz, adding that the other big challenge is “funding”.Yet, what happened 25 years ago changed the national conversation on the disease and laid the grounds for the HIV/AIDS Bill passed by Parliament + last month. “The dream of having an integrationist approach which requires testing with informed consent and preserving confidentiality and integration of the individual in society has been passed,” says Anand Grover, Dominic’s counsel, who’s been fighting for HIV patients in court since he first met Dominic. “We not only became good friends but worked to oppose the Centre from adopting the Goa Public Health Act model nationally. That was India’s first movement on HIV issues.”The HIV/AIDS Bill passed by Parliament was drafted by Grover’s Lawyers Collective. But Grover is apprehensive about the ‘test and treat’ policy of providing ART as soon as a person tests positive irrespective of his CD count or clinical stage that it introduced. “India is still far from the goal of complying with the 500 CD count regimen even now,” says Grover. Moreover, the caveat it introduced about treatment services being provided ‘as far as possible’ could be an escape route for government to evade its obligations. A lot remains to be done.”Grover’s resolve was predestined. In May 1992, shortly before his death, Dominic had “extracted” a promise from Grover. “A promise I did not realize would have a profound impact on me. It was May 22, 1992. I got a call about Dominic being seriously ill and in Breach Candy hospital in Mumbai. I rushed there. The otherwise handsome young man was skin and bones, but he was only interested in what I was doing for HIV issues.

At present, 33,000 positive people are on ART in Mumbai.“We have asked the various Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) in the city to compile a list of people who tested positive at their centre but are not on ART,“ said MDACS additional project director Dr Srikala Acharya. Considering that ICTCs gets a mixed crowd including migrants, it is not likely to be an easy exercise.“We not only have to locate them, we have to get a fresh CD4 count done. Thereafter, we have to counsel them about taking ART,“ said Dr Acharya. The HIV virus remains asymptomatic for years, and it's only when the viral load increases beyond a limit that HIV-positive people start exhibiting outward symptoms such as weight loss and poor immunity against diseases.“Adherence will be a big issue because why would asymptomatic HIV-positive people take strong medicines like ART,“ said infectious diseases specialist and immunologist Dr Om Srivastava.People need to be counseled about the benefits of ART in the long run (see box).Latest research published in the Lancet said life expectancy for young HIV-positive adults has risen by 10 years in the United States and Europe due to antiretroviral therapy. “This meant many patients can expect to live as long as those without HIV,“ said the Lancet report.Moreover, there could an increase in drug resistance if positive people start ART and discontinue it mid-way. “India has to be ready for people developing resistance to firstand second-line drugs. Adequate stocks of secondand third-line drugs should be maintained,“ said Dr Srivastava, who said the private sector had started its 'test and treat' policy over two years ago.However, MDACS's Dr Acharya said that there were adequate stocks of all ART drug combinations in Mumbai.Another senior doctor in the government sector, howe ver, was skeptical about the 'test and treat' policy. “It seems to be a pharma-driven agenda to boost sales of medicines,“ said the doctor."

Currently, there are 5,527 registered HIV positive patients in the state. Out of these, 2,913 people are on ART, which according to NACO guidelines, is given to patients whose CD4 (a type of white blood cells) count is below 500. Till now, while 2,913 patients taking ART were given free medicines, the remaining 2,314 patients were excluded from the scheme. However, from this week, USACS will provide free drugs to all 5,527 patients. In another welcome move, USACS has decided to help poor patients in getting subsidized food grains from district food offices. Also, the destitute will not have to endure long queues and will be helped by officials at ART centres. These officials will coordinate with district food officers for getting ID cards for the patients.Gagan Luthra, who is a project officer with USACS, said, “Both these initiatives are equally important. In majority of the cases, HIV positive patients are abandoned by their families. Some of the poor patients suffer from poverty and hunger which deteriorates their health. The food security provided to them will ensure that they do not suffer due to hunger.”HIV positive patients in the state have been demanding food and travel subsidy for a long time. One of their primary demands is that of travel pass. “We often miss out on medication as we are unable to travel to other parts of the city or the state for check-ups. Most of the times, we don’t have the money to travel and hence a travel pass is very important for us,” said an HIV positive patient from Dehradun."

The anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre in Bareilly has so far identified 19 children in this category. Officials said that irrespective of their family's financial condition, children of HIV positive people can now apply for free education in private schools. However, only kids between three and seven years will be eligible for an entry. ""Admissions will be given only in nursery and Class I. We have identified 19 children under this category and have registered them with our centre. We have informed the district magistrate and the Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) about them. The last date for registering students under this category is June 19,"" said Manoj Verma, data manager, ART centre.""Though many HIV patients approached us for free education for their kids in private schools, their children were above seven and hence could not be registered. The selected students will have to apply on the RTE website. If the number of applications is higher than the reserved seats, BSA will take a final call on the basis of a lottery system,"" added Verma.Under the RTE Act, all private schools are required to fill 25% of seats with students belonging to economically weaker sections.The government has been providing free treatment, medicines and travel allowance to HIV patients on their visit to ART centres. A total of 1,940 persons are registered with the ART centre and of these, treatment of 1,385 patients has been initiated. These patients also include 90 children below 14. "

But a matter of even more serious concern is that the percentage of women with comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS is quite low here. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -4 (2015-16), only 19.1% of women have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. The situation is even worse in rural areas, where only 14.7% of women (age 15-49 years) have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Over the past few years, the National AIDS Control Society has cut down funds given to AIDS control society across the country. It could be one of the reasons of lack of comprehensive awareness of HIV/AIDS among population of the state. In 2005-06 (NFHS-3), it was shown that 17.3% of woman had comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS in the state. It means that the situation has not improved significantly over the past ten years. Among males, the situation is slightly better. According to NFHS -4, there are 37.4% of males having comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Ten years ago (NFHS-3), 33.4% of males had comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS."

Police suspect she might have been suffering from depression since her mother died of AIDS five months ago and committed suicide. They are waiting for the post-mortem report to rule out foul play.The girl has been living at the Be hala address for the past few years. It was her mother who had decided to return to her parents' home with her son and daughter after her husband deserted them when he was detected with AIDS. The girl's mother had died in January . The family suspects the father, too, may have died by now.The girl's grandmother said her son-in-law had never contacted the family after walking out a few years ago.It was the girl's 11-year-old brother who first spotted her body hanging from the ceiling. It was he who cut the rope and brought her down. Their maternal uncle then rushed to Vidyasagar S G Hospital with the body , where doctors declared her dead.Neighbours said both the girl and the boy studied at local schools in Be hala. They lived in the house alongwith the grandmother, a maternal uncle and a pet dog.The family had been living in the two-room tolly-roofed house -a stark misfit in the middle-class neighbourhood of Senhati Bazaar in Behala for the past several years.“The young boy was visibly shaken after he brought down the lifeless body of his sister. He has not been speaking to anyone. To make matters worse, cops called him and his elderly grandmother to the police station and recorded their statements for several hours on Thursday . They looked physically and emotionally drained when they came back home on Thursday night,“ said a neighbour, unwilling to be named.TOI attempted to speak to both the boy and the grandmother, but they refused to speak. “We don't want to say anything. I just wish no one has to go through the kind of suffering me and my grandson are going through. We are tired and don't have anything to share,“ the grandmother told TOI on Thursday evening.According to the uncle, the girl was undergoing treatment and aware of her disease. Locals said she had tried to escape a couple of years ago, but the attempt was foiled after a neighbour spotted her."

According to estimates, there are 66,000 IDUs in the northeast. As per HIV Sentinel Surveillance data, IDUs constitute 1.46% of the high-risk group for HIV. Kailash Ditya, deputy team leader of Project Sunrise, a project that oversees a prison intervention program (PIP) for high risk groups among prisoners, told TOI that 40 inmates at Guwahati Central Jail with a history of IDUs have been tested for HIV/AIDS since January. ""We are working on to bring down demand, supply and harm reduction among the inmates. There is also risk assessment at the same time among the inmates"" said Ditya. Though harm reduction programmes (HRN) and oral/opiod substitution therapy (OST) is gaining ground in HIV-afflicted states like Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Mizoram, reaching OST to all parts of the northeast is a challenge because 84% of the population in the northeast resides in rural areas. ""The Centre has to initiate a surveillance system for HCV at the earliest. IDUs are most vulnerable to HCV. There is no data of how many are affected. There is the need for estimation and study of the disease burden of HCV. Without estimation, proper policy cannot be formulated,"" said Ketholelie Angami, the chairperson of Northeast Hepatitis C Forum."

Following the Centre’s guideline, the state health department will make available ‘test and treat’ facility to the people from the day they are detected HIV positive. HIV targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. HIV positive patients, whose CD4 cell count is below 400, are treated free of cost at ART centres in Bihar. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. “Now, as soon as a person is tested and found HIV positive, s/he will be eligible for ART irrespective of his CD count or clinical stage. This will help save patients from many opportunistic infections. Patients will be monitored after every six months,” said Bihar State Aids Control Society’s (BSACS) care and support treatment’s joint director Dr Basuki Nath Gupta. “Although all HIV positive patients, irrespective of their CD4 count and asymptomatic infection will now be eligible for ART, all the treatment protocols will be followed. Before we start ART, we test the patient to rule out all opportunistic infections. If the patient is suffering from any sort of infection, in most cases it is tuberculosis, then we treat him for that infection first before starting ART,” said Dr Mukul Kumar of the ART centre at Patna Medical College and Hospital.He said early treatment increases immunity and the longevity of the patient and reduces the chances of getting opportunistic infections in future.Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, who is the medical director of Regional AIDS Training Centre and Network and a member of International AIDS Society, said although this strategy had been implemented by WHO and other internal societies 3 years back, the Indian government move is welcomed.“Early treatment reduces the morbidity and mortality rate significantly. Treating a patient early means we may be able to keep the person immune from TB and fungal infections. Also, the viral load becomes nearly undetectable in the blood, thus reducing the transmission to almost zero,” said Tejashwi. He said the patient would be getting treatment even before he suffers any illness due to HIV. “It is cost effective and suppresses the disease from spreading” he added."

But the money an astrologer earns from this unique practice undoubtedly serves a good social cause. With the income he makes, astrologer Vijay supports at least 30 HIV-infected children in his village in Erode district. Astrology's purpose, according to Vijay, is to interpret the positions of the planets and stars in the sky to gather information on an individual. But in his social life, it goes beyond that. Vijay learnt the art after studying in detail the lines and patterns on one's big toe. For him, it all began at the age of 18. Today, he has read the lines on more than 4,500 big toes of people from different walks of life. Solutions may vary, but it's his devotion for this rare field of astrology that still brings people to his village called Avalpunthurai, 12 km from Erode. As a child, Vijay was different from his friends. Besides being a staunch devotee of lord Shiva, he was fond of dogs, considered the vahana (vehicle) of the lord. To express his devotion towards dogs, he even ran a shelter for dogs in his village. ""I was a devotee of Shiva from my childhood. When I grew up, I used to dream of the lord. It was in one such dream that I got the idea of toe-reading,"" said Vijay, who was in Chennai recently. Vijay takes the print of one's big toe and studies the various lines on it. ""It takes four to five hours in some cases, but I could give solutions to most people who have approached me so far,"" he said.But learning to read the lines on one's big toe was not easy as Vijay didn't have any basic training on astrology. When he turned 18, Vijay started studying toe-prints of people and conducted research on how they are related to one's past and present.Vijay first started taking the toe-prints of some drunkards in his village. He then started analyzing the lines on the big toes of people who are suffering from health problems. It took a couple of years for him to understand the difference between the lines found on toes of people suffering from various issues. ""People in my village thought I was mad. And my strong faith in lord Shiva was another reason for them to feel so. But I didn't look back. I studied the toe-prints of more than 1,000 people during my research. It was after getting a clear understanding about the subject, I began reading the big toes of people and started giving solutions to their problems,"" said 38-year-old Vijay.What makes Vijay truly different, however, is the noble act that he does for the HIV-infected children in his village. ""I am not doing toe-reading for money. I am doing this under the instruction from my god. The money is used for the welfare of some 30 HIV-infected children in my village,"" he said. Besides, the Sri Bhairava Foundation, under his chairmanship, has contributed to a number of heart operations, particularly for children, conducted in and around Erode."

These are among the 12,058 new patients added to the HIV/AIDS caseload over the past 12 months.Drugs like heroin, cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy) - known as street-drugs are commonly injected despite the high risk of contracting AIDS. In fact, one in 23 women and one in 36 men, who inject drugs have a risk of contracting AIDS, health authorities say.Overall, the state has an estimated 400 such AIDS patients who contacted the dreaded virus through intravenous drug injections. Apart from the street drugs, even prescription drugs like tablets, capsules and liquids are injected occasionally, say insiders.""Drug abusers often begin with taking pills or snorting drugs in the powdered form, slowly graduate to the intravenous method. Most of the abusers are obsessed with being on a perpetual high. Over time, the usage of pills, capsules, puffing and snorting slowly reduce the impact and hence they switch to intravenous drugs,"" said an official at the Narcotics Control Bureau.These injectable drugs are often make from powder or crystal form of drugs by dissolving them in water. Sometimes it is even heated up if required and later drawn in to the syringe by dipping a cotton ball into the solution. ""The fact that many of the drug users also have unsafe sexual practices, increase the risk of HIV due to sharing of the syringes,"" added the official.Apart from getting a high, there are many more reasons why addicts graduate to intravenous drugs say experts, even if it comes with the highest risk of contracting AIDS as well as other blood-related infections. ""The type of injected drug are opioids- the most well-known of which is heroin. Other opioid medicines that IV drugs users frequently abuse are fentanyl, Talwin and buprenorphine, as well as the prescription painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone (the latter two are first crushed into a powder and then dissolved into a solution for injection),"" added Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant internal medicine, Maxcure hospitals. Stimulants are popular with IV drug users because they quickly deliver a strong feeling of euphoria, as well as increased energy, reduced appetite and a reduced need for sleep. ""People who repeatedly snort suffer discomfort due to perforation of nasal mucosa, sinusitis, nose bleeds, loss of sense of smell, problems in swallowing and hoarseness,"" he added."

He had become familiar with the symptoms while undertaking a survey in the Western Ghats in the late 70s. Two tests later, he was proved right. The man had syphilis, a sexually-transmitted disease the septuagenarian white-coat thought he wouldn't see again.A once common STD in the pre-antibiotic era, the prevalence of syphilis was brought down from 8% of the population to less than 1%. In 2011, the National Aids Control Organsiation (NACO) had announced that the country is on the verge of eliminating the bacterial infection. However, six years on, doctors say they are seeing a rise in those testing positive for syphilis among other sexually transmitted diseases, even as the prevalence of HIV is on the decline.Data accessed by TOI from Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) has shown that from 2014 to 2016, the number of those who tested positive for HIV went down from 16,708 to 11,395 ­ a 30% decline, with the number of new cases detected decreasing by half from around 2,700. The second most common STD was Herpes genetalis -marked by genital pain and sores in some, and no symptoms in most --which, too, went down by close to 40% from 2014-2016. The biggest surprise for officials was the increase in syphilis cases from around 1,300 in 2014 to 1,700 the following year.“This could be because of better awareness and surveillance,“ said Dr K Senthil Raj, TANSACS director, adding that many of these cases were picked up in Chennai, Salem and Nammakkal. Researchers say syphilis is on a gradual incline across the country along with other STDs like genital infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and, in some pockets, Herpes genetalis.“And in some groups like men who have sex with men, the prevalence of syphilis is significantly high,“ said Dr R R Gangakhedkar, director-incharge of National AIDS Research Institute. He said the prevalence of HIV has decreased across the country because of better intervention by Anti-Retroviral Therapy centres.“While these centres cut the HIV transmission by 93%, alot of other STDs go missed,“ he added. While the transmission efficiency of HIV is low, varying between one in 100 to one in 1000, syphilis occurs in one in 30 people who has come in contact with a carrier. On the brighter side, he said most of those with STDs come at an early stage because of better awareness and hence treated before complications set in.India records 30 million episodes of STDs annually , of which the government treats about 10 million.While government facilities target high-risk groups like the transgender community , female sex workers and homosexual groups, private labs say they have been seeing a steady increase in those reporting with STDs among the general population, especially in the 18-35 years age group.“We have seen a 20% rise of cases of HPV and Herpes. Some of the STDs are detected when the person presents with infertility-related problems,“ said Dr Anita Suryanarayan, vice-president, operations (south India), Metropolis Healthcare Ltd. While the government has several targeted interventions for promoting safe sex, awareness is relatively low among youngsters from the middle and upper class, she felt."

Bengal joins other states, like Kerala, Puducherry, Goa, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, in following a Supreme Court directive asking state governments to consider issuing such a notification.“The change of rules will ensure these students get the same facilities that SC, ST students and those classified under minority groups get under the provisions of the RTE Act, 2009. They will get government grants, reservation, scholarships and hostel facilities like the other disadvantaged students. The notification has already been sent to all WBBSE schools,” a senior school education department official said.The SC order came after a Delhi-based NGO, working with HIV/AIDS patients, submitted that children living with HIV-positive parents or affected by HIV were suffering segregation and, in many cases, were being compelled to leave school even though there was zero risk of transmission of the disease. The apex court then asked state governments to consider issuing this notification.“We got some cases, mainly from Howrah, South 24-Parganas and Murshidababd, where schools were under pressure from guardians of other students to ostracise HIV-positive students,” an official said.A recent National Aids Control Organisation report says nearly 22,000 children in Bengal (out of the 1.45 lakh under-15 population) are suffering from HIV. “This number is huge and increasing. The government’s concern for these students will help them,” Subhashgram Nabatara Vidyalaya headmaster Anupam Roy said."
53,8,2017,Most new HIV infections detected in 2016-17 were from Maharashtra,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/most-new-hiv-infections-detected-in-2016-17-were-from-maha/articleshow/60181815.cms,"Mumbai: Maharashtra detected the highest number of new HIV infections among states in 2016-17, accounting for 16% of the country’s 1.84 lakh fresh cases. Among the infected were 1,567 newborns who probably didn’t get the preventive drugs on time, while 200 adults got the disease due to transfusion with infected blood.This is the second year in a row when the state held on to the dubious distinction of reporting maximum cases after occupying the second and third positions through the last decade. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were the only states to report 20,000-plus new infections in 2016-17.RTI data obtained from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) showed while the state is recording a year-on-year decline, the rate is less than many other high-prevalence states. The state also reported the most mother-to-child transmissions in the country. In the last five years, at least 10,449 newborns got the infection despite the availability of the triple-drug regimen that cuts chances of transmission by 99%. Head of state-run JJ Hospital in Byculla, Dr Ashok Anand, said they have not delivered a single HIV-positive baby in the last three to four years. “Giving anti-retroviral to babies soon after birth as well as putting the mother on anti-retroviral therapy early has proved to be very effective,” he said. Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI said, “It is shameful that even today babies are getting the deadly disease when drugs are readily available.” Parimal Singh, who heads the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS), defended the programme and said not just mother-to-child transmission but HIV among general and high-risk populations has been on a decline. “It must be taken into consideration that we came to the top spot only after Andhra Pradesh was divided. As far as babies getting HIV is concerned, today HIV+ mothers are no longer afraid of giving birth and this is the programme’s achievement,” he said. MSACS’ data shows from 2009-10 when HIV positivity in general population was around 5.23%, it has dropped to less than 1% today. State’s public health minister Dr Deepak Sawant added Maharashtra is in a vulnerable position given the huge load of migration. Data also shows a dip in transmission of the disease among homosexuals, bisexuals and transgenders. A few stakeholders however contest intervention to contain HIV in the state has lost steam. Arup Mukherjee, secretary general of the Nagpur-based Indian Red Cross Society, said a fund crunch has been hampering the project for the last two years. “The attrition rate is huge as NGOs are struggling to pay salaries on time. Often testing kits are not available,” he said. Sawant said NACO is responsible for providing 75% of funds. “The state is doing its bit,” he said. Singh added Maharashtra and Mumbai are role models for their HIV control strategies. Of course, even after three decades, both the state and city remain hotbeds for the infection."

The move is, however, being seen as a ‘ridiculous’ one by social activists as they see it as an infringement of privacy of people living with HIV.When a 45-year-old HIV patient reached Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Sawai Man Singh Hospital to get medicines, the healthcare staff asked her to submit Aadhaar card’s photocopy. “They asked me if I have Aadhaar card and that I should submit its photocopy,” the patient who is taking medicine for HIV for over 10 years, said.The RSACS has sent messages to all its ART centres, which provide medicines to people with HIV/AIDS across the state, to collect Aadhaar from beneficiaries.“Other departments are also linking social benefit schemes with Aadhaar, so we have also decided to link it. But, we have not made it compulsory for getting medicines. If a person does not have Aadhaar, he/she will continue to get medicines. We will not stop providing them medicines,” said Dr S S Chauhan, director, RSACS.In the state, there are 23 ART centres that provide testing and treatment facilities to 55,000 odd people living with HIV.Officials said that Aadhaar will help in keeping a track on beneficiaries (people living with HIV), who go missing during treatment. Also, through Aadhaar, department will ensure that a particular beneficiary is not registered at different ART centres. They will generate a whole database online, which will have their Aadhaar number. If a person goes to an ART for HIV testing, the online software through Aadhaar will detect automatically if he is already registered at some other ART.Reacting on it, social activists are apprehensive that this may increase risk of revealing identity of people living with HIV/AIDS.“HIV is a severe privacy issue. But it has been seen in the past that your Aadhaar is compromised at many places. There are instances of it being stolen. The question arises that how the state government will keep such database safe,” said activist Nikhil Dey.Dey said, “Once it’s leaked, how they (those who get it) will use it. There is a stigma attached to HIV, so it is ridiculous to collect Aadhaar from those who are already marginalised. If they made it mandatory, there are chances of exclusion of those who do not have Aadhaar from getting benefits of government schemes.”Social activists termed the step as “ridiculous”. Collecting Aadhaar from all people living with HIV/AIDS is quite challenging at a time when such people living with HIV/AIDS registered at ART do not share even their original name and address to ensure their original identity is not revealed to anyone, even at ART centres."

They alleged that only possible way the girl might have got infected with the virus is when she underwent a blood transfusion at RCC as part of her treatment.Medical College sub-inspector D Girilal said the probe has just been launched and it was too early to say whether the allegation raised against the state-run cancer care hospital was genuine. The parents of the girl have told the police that before starting treatment under RCC in March this year, the girl was treated at a few other hospitals too.‘’But, they are sure that the girl did not have the infection before the blood transfusion here as they were constantly monitoring her condition owing to continued treatment,” the sub-inspector said.Kazhakootam Cyber City assistant commissioner A Pramod Kumar, under whose jurisdiction the RCC comes, said the matter will be discussed with forensic experts and then it will be referred to a medical board as per procedureRCC director and PRO were unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts to contact them.Read this story in Malayalam"

Cops have booked the man’s sister, a nurse, for allegedly helping him extract their mother’s blood. After the incident, the two-month pregnant woman underwent an abortion. Bandra-Kurla Complex police arrested Abhimanyu Kamble (26) on September 6 for injecting the syringe into his wife’s back after an argument. Kamble and his wife Anita met in 2013 and got married a year later. Barely a year into the marriage, Kamble allegedly began to physically assault Anita. In 2016, Anita lodged a domestic violence complaint against Kamble at Tilak Nagar police station. However, even after the case was filed, things did not improve between them. She filed for divorce.On the day of the incident, the couple was present in court around 2pm, both with their respective relatives, when they got into an argument. A while later, Anita told her parents that she wanted to use the washroom. As she was walking towards it, she felt something pierce her back. She told cops that when she was pulling out the syringe, she was shocked to see her husband nearby, and pushed him. Apprehending trouble, Kamble fled. Kalpana Gadekar, senior inspector, BKC police station, confirmed the development. “We asked him whose blood was it and Kamble replied that it was extracted from his mother, who is an HIV patient. During interrogation, he told the police that his sister, who has done a nursing course and earlier worked in a Navi Mumbai hospital, had helped collect the blood. We have made her an accused in the case too,” said Gadekar. He was arrested, interrogated and released on bail. Police said they have learnt that in her complaint to Tilak Nagar police, Anita also alleged that Kamble would subject her to unnatural sex. “Kamble insisted that if she withdrew her complaint, he would agree to the divorce. She was therefore shocked over the syringe attack,” said an officer. Cops have sent the red liquid for chemical analysis to Kalina forensic science laboratory. She was sent for a medical examination. Cops have reportedly written to Bhabha Hospital, asking them to conduct an advanced test to find if the HIV-positive blood can pose a health risk."

The building was constructed with funds Malzner raised over the past five years from Austria to give a permanent residence to 40-odd children, who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS. These children have been living rented homes for the past 12 years and forced to shift at least 15 times.The birthday celebration was made special as the new building for the care home was inaugurated on the same day. “I will never forget this birthday,” Malzner told ToI.Malzner raised 60,000 Euros on her own and persuaded an organisation called Karibu World, which chipped in with 60,000 Euros for the care home. “I raised 60,000 Euros and Karibu World also contributed an equal amount. Since Karibu World receives funds from the Austrian government, we can say that the government too helped in the construction of the building,” she said.It was a challenging task for Malzner to raise funds in her country. “I faced problems initially. But then I showed them my presentation, why I was doing it and they developed trust in me,” said Malzner.Malzner has a restaurant and also a shop in Hirschbach Im Mühlkreis, Oberosterreich, Austria. She also had many friends in the restaurant business. On her request, they agreed to donate amounts ranging from one Euro to five Euros per soup sold at theier establishments to Malzner.“I also sold scarfs in Austria which I took from India. The margin I got was donated to for the cause. I also organised parties, including dance events and food festivals, and asked participants to contribute,” Malzner said.She had first come to Jaipur in 2013 as a volunteer with an organisation to teach English to children in Katputli Nagar. “I came here in 2013 to do some community work for four weeks. It was not my aim to construct a building for such children. But, after spending four weeks in Kotpulti Nagar, I wanted to do more good work. So, I decided to work for these children,” said Malzner said, dressed in an Indian saree.“The child welfare committee (CWC) has inspected the house and given permission for shifting the children,” said CWC member Nisha Pareek.The children are being taken care of by the NGO, Aashray Care Home. “Our organisation was registered in 2006. Since then, we had to shift from at least 15 homes. It was difficult for us to get homes on rent for HIV children,” said, Sushila Mordiya, superintendent Aashray Care Home."

While the overall HIV positivity in blood units collected in the city has been decreasing, it seems that the infection rate at the National AIDS Control Organisation-supported blood banks has remained stagnant for the last four years. An average of 480 units of HIV-infected blood is detected every year. Interestingly, HIV positivity in non-NACO blood banks has been showing a steady decrease.A third of the 61 blood banks in Mumbai are supported by NACO and most of these are in public hospitals. Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS, said as per National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) guidelines blood banks should collect information about donors in case they need to be contacted for counselling or treatment in the event of their reports indicating positive for an infection. “It’s a part of the pre-donor counselling that is supposed to be done before blood collection. It is not mandatory, but it is a part of the guidelines,” she said.Acharya added, “Often blood units are collected through camps, where a person may or may not have given his contact details. This is why we are strengthening referral systems.”"

People of all walks of life make it a point to celebrate this festival. With increasing social concerns, people prefer to lace their celebrations with a good deed. A group of like-minded people started working a fortnight ahead of Diwali to collate whatever they could like money and clothes and distribute them among the orphans and elderly. This year too, they collected the materials but there was a certain delay due to GST and finances were tight.Padikattugal, a youth forum in the city distributed clothes and sweets to children affected with HIV. They have been doing it for last five years. For the past three years, they set up a stall in one of the textile showrooms to collect money or clothes from people shopping in the textiles outlet. After required money is mobilised, they take the children from orphanages for shopping before the shop opens for public. This year, however, there was considerable delay in collating money and clothes. “We could not take children for shopping. Most of them donate food on Diwali days, but clothes, sweets and crackers make their Diwali which is the reason we collect these goodies for them,” said S Malaisamy, managing trustee of Padikattugal.In spite of financial constraints, generosity of willing public surpasses the difficulties, quipped V P Manikandan, a social worker in the city. “It is true that money was tight this year but good-hearted people do contribute whatever they can”, he mentioned. On Wednesday, Manikandan along with volunteers and social workers will be visiting couple of orphanages and old age homes to celebrate Deepavali. “More than goodies, the rejected lot of society enjoy company of people. There are some to remember them”, he added.Even ahead of Diwali, a group of transgenders celebrated the festival with the corporation home for destitutes at Uthangudi. As many as 150 students from Maharishi Vidhya Mandir School, Kovilpappakudi decided to celebrate the festival with differently-abled children. On Monday, they visited Able Kids Special School at Arapalayam. They conducted cultural programmes for these special children and they had a great time together. "

He alleged that the accused had illicit relations with a man who would visit their house in his absence. “That man helped her execute the crime,” he added.The police have, however, not challaned the other accused.Their daughter was also taking treatment for HIV, he said. The court concluded that the circumstances so established were consistent with the hypothesis of guilt and inconsistent with innocence of the accused. The convict submitted that she was married and had a five-year-old girl, who was HIV positive, so she be shown leniency.On the other hand, additional public prosecutor argued that the convict has committed grave and serious offence and had acted brutally while committing the murder, therefore no leniency should be shown.

In the absence of testing kits, blood that has been collected from donors cannot be utilized for patients.The public blood banks in the city get their testing kits from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), which purchases them centrally. In November, most blood banks have not received their supply and are scrambling to make last-minute purchases locally. It is feared that the existing shortage of blood in the city may be aggravated by the lack of testing kits as even if blood is collected it cannot be given to patients without certifying it as infection-free.Staffers from several blood banks, including Cama and Albless, St George, GT, have confirmed that they have run out of testing kits. Dean of Parel’s KEM Hospital Dr Avinash Supe said that since the kits have not come, they have purchased locally. The Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) distributes kits on behalf of the NACO to the city blood banks. Supe said, “MDACS has not provided us kits. We have made purchases and have adequate stock now,” he said. KEM’s blood bank collects over 12,000 units of blood annually, the highest in the city. Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of the MDACS, confirmed that the kits have not arrived from NACO."

The whole episode had a whiff of alleged discrimination against the woman she is suffering from a disease, which it seems is still considered to be a social taboo here.The unprecedented turn of events left the patient, with an extremely low haemoglobin count and her relatives shaken. “I was told by Sultania hospital doctors to return to the government hospital in Sehore, where I gave birth to a baby. Sehore doctors referred me to Bhopal by saying that I needed care at a higher hospital. I feel like a total outcast. Rights of patients like me, who are suffering from HIV infection, need to be protected.”The patient was referred to the state capital, hours after she delivered a baby on Tuesday morning. Her newborn was admitted to the neonatal care unit in Sehore. In her mid-20s, the woman underwent a normal delivery in the Sehore hospital and after being given some much-needed blood, her condition was expected to stabilise.The woman’s relatives also alleged discrimination and saw no reason for her referral. “My sister was shivering and had high temperature. But, we could very well sense that she was not welcome in the hospital, like other regular patients,” said the patient’s sister. The family travelled to Bhopal by road and reached the Sultania hospital. They are residents of a village some 22 kilometres away from Sehore town.At around 4 pm on Tuesday, Sehore-based government hospital gynaecologist Dr Amita Shirvatava explained the situation by saying “The patient had a medical condition, including low blood pressure and pulmonary issues. It was my opinion that the patient would be better served at a higher centre.”Speaking to TOI, chief medical and research officer (CMHO) Dr A Qureshi said, “Prima facie there is no indication of discrimination. However, a full report has been sought from the concerned department.”“I am aware of an HIV positive patient coming to the hospital. However, her admission or otherwise is not known to me. I would have to investigate the matter,” said Dr Aruna Kumar, the head of department of gynaecology at Sultania hospital.After a call to the CMHO, within a span of two hours hospital officials informed that the HIV patient was admitted again in Sehore. She was discharged from Sultania hospital and taken back to Sehore within hours of being referred to Bhopal.“The woman was referred after a successful intervention. There is no discrimination in the matter,” said Dr Malti Arya, the doctor who was on duty when the patient was referred to Bhopal.Sources said few months back, another HIV positive patient, who reached the same government hospital for her delivery, was forced to opt for a delivery at a private hospital."

HIV positive people are registered for second line ART in PGIMER, Chandigarh, which caters to Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Dehradun and Chandigarh. PGI is one of the centres of excellence for ART, north of Delhi.“We have been coming across cases where patients have not got medicines for the past three months. Every day, two to three persons come to my office to raise the issue of non-availability of medicines. Most of them have been discontinued,” said Pooja Thakur, an HIV activist from Chandigarh. Experts said missing doses, especially when a patient is on second line of treatment, can be very risky. “We have been facing shortage of these medicines for a while, however, this is being resolved. We have tied up with the Punjab State AIDS Control Society, which will give us the medicines. We had been facing the problem for a few days due to cash crunch from NACO,” said Dr Vanita Gupta, project director, Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS). She also said they would reimburse patients who buy medicines from the market. Countering the version of SACS officials, Pooja said, “The total amount for second line ART amounts to around Rs 5,000 per month. This is unaffordable. How can anyone take a reimbursement when there is no paying capacity?”Out of the 300 patients getting second line treatment from PGI, 30 are from Chandigarh, 90 from Haryana and 120 from Punjab. SACS, which is supposed to procure medicines, blames NACO for the situation, while NACO officials feel otherwise. “We supplied drugs to Punjab a few days ago. There is no shortage of funds from NACO. In fact, it is the responsibility of SACS to provide these medicines,” said Dr J S Malhi, regional coordinator, NACO. According to the Network of People living with HIV/Aids, Chandigarh, second line treatment drugs which are out of stock include Lamivudine, Zidovudine and Abacavir. These medicines are supposed to be given in combination. Missing even one renders the course incomplete. “Even children face the same problem. There are 30 children registered with PGIMER’s ART for second line treatment,” said a doctor at PGIMER."

Going by the Data of District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), of late, there has been an increase in cases between the age group of 40 to 49 years. Experts say the major reason for the change in trend in the viral disease is due to extramarital affairs. District Program Manager (DPM) of DAPCU, Trichy Dr SM Manivannan says, “The trend has changed after 2011. Analysis shows that the trend is a consequence of illicit affairs among married people. But on the whole, the prevalence of HIV-AIDS is declining.”Earlier, the incidence was prevalent among people in the age group of 30 to 39 years, due to the unawareness of the high risk behavior groups - Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender (TG). “HIV positive was high among the risk behavior groups, but after 2011 the trend declined and common people too have been tested positive,” said Dr Manivannan.Stating that the number of infected people is under control in Trichy district, the DPM said that currently 5,500 people were on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) treatment here. The number included FSW, MSM, TG and normal people.Few years ago, there was a panic among HIV-infected people that the viral infection was the end of their life. Now, doctors term it as a chronically manageable disease. “If a patient is regularly on ART, the life expectancy of the patient will not decrease,” said Dr R Sharmila at ART Centre inside Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). ART is a tablet which was prescribed to those who had CD4 count below 300. However, the tablet has been made available to all infected people irrespective of their CD4 count. “The regular follow-up on patients and intake of ART tablet increases the longevity of the patients. If anyone was missing out on treatment, the Target Intervention (TI)-NGOs will keep track of them and bring them back on track for treatment,” he said."

The state ranks eighth in the country in HIV prevalence.According to experts, the alarming number of deaths could be because of restrictions put by the government on free antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with the deadly disease. Of the 80,173 people who died of the disease, only 60,208 were provided antiretroviral therapy by the government, while the rest 19,965 were left out as they were not deemed eligible for the treatment.“How come this data is not available on the website? Peer educators, who spread the prevention message among sex workers and play a crucial role, have not been paid honorarium for many months. Unless the state government wakes up and reaches out to the last person, its efforts to cut down on fresh HIV cases won’t yield results,” said David Bodapatti, public health activist who has been working with the affected community.KSAPS authorities claimed that the state has taken considerable steps to reduce the number of HIV cases. “In prevention of mother-to- child transmission, the state has taken preventive measures. Every pregnant woman is tested for HIV, and if found positive is immediately provided antiretroviral therapy. The number of children tested HIV positive at the age of 18 months was 43 in 2014-15, and has come down to 31 in 2017-18. The mother-to-child transmission rate has come down to less than 5%,” officials said."

Out of 2,304 HIV positive patients in the district, around 33% were from Thane city, including Mira Road and Bhayander. This was stated in the 2016-17 report of Thane’s District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). However, there has been a drop in the number of cases in the entire district.The officials claimed that Thane city, comprising of Thane, Mira Road and Bhayander, had more people who belong to the high risk population. Navi Mumbai and Bhiwandi were among the top three places in the district that were detected with the most number of cases.“These cities not only have a high population, but also have people from the high risk zone —like sex workers, migrants, transgenders, truck drivers, etc. It was also seen that out of the ones who were detected positive, 80% got infected due to unsafe sex. While others got it through blood transfusion. Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus. This drop is because of the awareness drives being carried out by various organisations,” said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of theDAPCU.The department, along with 33 NGOs, conduct awareness drives on regular basis and focus more on the people belonging to the high risk communities.“Out of those who fall under the high risk category, the highest number of people tested positive were migrant workers and and truck drivers. But there has been a rise in the number of patients taking the HIV test. This is because of the awareness drives we have been carrying out in these pockets. During these drives, we request those infected with the virus to come to the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre for tests,” said Gadhave.However, there has been a drop in HIV positive cases in the district. This is an indication that the awareness drives and sensitization programmes organized by the state authorities and voluntary groups in the last seven years has shown positive results. While there were 5,154 HIV cases in 2010-11, the numbers came down to around 2,304 in 2016-2017. "

Though the centre has played ‘matchmaker’ for 30 couples so far, Arun and Radhika’s was the first success story.With Dr Solomon’s encouragement, Arun decided to meet prospective brides. That’s when Dr Solomon heard about Radhika, a young woman from Maharashtra. And once Arun met her and her family, he was quick to make up his mind. Radhika, who takes tuitions at home, was also willing to take the plunge. ""I didn’t want to be alone for the rest of my life, and wanted the emotional support a partner can give,"" she says. The next hurdle was convincing his parents who were still unaware that he is HIV+ve. Arun’s family was quick to come around and the only barrier was language.But there was another, bigger challenge ahead. The couple, who got married in July 2001, discovered that Radhika was pregnant in September. ""We were scared but both of us were on medication and our son, born in 2002, is HIV-ve,"" says Arun.Till today, they have not disclosed their HIV+ve identity to friends, Arun’s family, or their son.""There is still some stigma attached to the disease as people have misconceptions about it,"" says Radhika. ""But there is nothing to fear. We take our medicines every day, eat healthy and go to the hospital every six months to check our CD4 (white blood cell counts) and viral loads,"" says Radhika.Arun says getting married and having a child has given direction to his life. ""If you live on your own, you can get depressed. My outlook to life changed after marriage, and now I have a son to live and work for, which gives purpose to my life,"" he says.He has just one word of advice for people. ""If you are in the high-risk group, do go to the doctor and get an HIV test done. With timely and regular treatment, you can lead a normal life."" (*Names have been changed to protect identity)"
75,12,2017,This rehab centre is home to HIV positive women,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/this-rehab-centre-is-home-to-hiv-positive-women/articleshow/61871133.cms,"Nashik: Her in-laws threw her out when Anita’s husband died of AIDS and she was diagnosed with HIV positive ten years ago. Her parents, who lived in the tribal belt of Warora tehsil in Chandrapur district also did not allow her to stay with them. But, Anita (name changed) was lucky to find shelter at Yash Foundation’s rehabilitation centre in Nashik. “I have been here for eight-nine years. As I earn now, my family is ready to welcome me. But, I rarely visit them. The centre is my home now,” she says.The centre run by the Yash Foundation in Nashik near Gangapur Naka, has nine women residents busy in stitching handbags and gloves. During Diwali, they make lanterns and earthen lamps. As the new academic and financial years begin, they take orders to make stationary for offices. Throughout the year, these engage themselves in various activities to earn their living. Many of them support their families too. The centre has trained 56 HIV positive women in various skills. Many of them completed their education from the Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University. Several got jobs in various companies, schools, government departments, or started started their own small-scale business. Former residents often visit the rehabilitation centre for the same reason.“They can share their experiences, feelings, health issues with us,” a former resident of the centre says. Funded through the corporate social responsibility activities of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd in Nashik, the centre is supported by a young team of the foundation. Ravindra Patil, head of Yash Foundation, says lack of awareness is responsible for the alienation of HIV positive people. “Often families throw them out and villagers order them out of their area just because people are not aware about AIDS and HIV. Its difficult to convince people in Nashik, Pune and Mumbai to buy the bags and gloves made by the HIV positive women.” “People think twice before buying the products made by these women. We can’t even think of entering the food-processing industry as it will be impossible to convince people to buy products made by HIV positive women,” Patil said.“Instead of participating in AIDS awareness rally for one day on December 1, it would be better if people accept us as a part of society. We don’t enjoy being treated as special people,” Anita says."

Senior medical officer at the centre Sunil Thakur told TOI, “During the last financial year there was only one such case. And it’s a positive sign as until a few years ago, the infection rate from mother-to-child was 25% across the country. Now it is 5%.”The number of cases of HIV transmission from mother to child had come down from nine in 2013-14 to one in the last fiscal.“This year we checked 55 infants and there has been not a single case of mother-to-child infection,” he added.He said it is encouraging that the government in July had issued a directive to all HIV-positive patients start ART, irrespective of their CD4 count. CD4 cells fight infections, but the HIV virus kills them. Medical experts at the ART centre said, if diagnosed and treated early with proper ART, HIV-positive patients can live for over 30 years. For the convenience of patients, the health department has started four ART Link centres in Manmad, Chandwad, Yeola and Niphad.Health officials said over the years there has been a dip in the number of patients registered as HIV positive.

The test essentially tells whether the treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of HIV virus in a patient’s blood.The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has already shortlisted laboratories across the country that would be scaled up to carry out the tests. However, it may be a while before every patient on antiretroviral therapy (ART) qualifies to undergo the expensive test, which costs between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 in a private laboratory.In 2013, the WHO had recommended the viral load-test be carried out within six months of starting an individual on ART and be repeated at the end of that year. Subsequently, it should be carried out annually. People living with HIV and NGOs have since been fighting for the test to be made routinely available and more accessible.“From February onward, 532 ART centres across the country will have the viral load-testing facility. In the initial phases, it will be offered to children below the age of five years, people taking treatment for five years and those suffering from HIV-TB co-infection. They have been chosen keeping the criticality of their condition in mind. The test will subsequently be available to all 1.2 million people on ART treatment in the country,” said Dr R S Gupta of NACO’s Care, Support and Treatment division. The civic-run KEM and Nair hospitals are likely to be the centres in the city.Currently, the test is selectively offered at the state-run JJ Hospital, where patients have to go through the stringent scrutiny of a committee.“The body takes between four and six months only to decide who will undergo the test. It’s unfortunate that in the absence of a viral load-test, the programme solely relies on CD4 count,” said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai Aids Forum (MAF). CD4 is an indicator of the body’s immune system. “But it’s only part information about what the virus is doing with the immune system. A high viral load in the body will usually, but not always, mean a low CD4 count,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who recommends viral load-testing every six months to one year.“Because of the unavailability of the test, patients also often don’t realize when they have become resistant to the first line or second line drugs,” said Poonam Patkar, secretary of MAF.Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) India that offers viral load-testing to KEM patients as a special model, run in collaboration with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said they have got great results in picking treatment failures early and improving outcomes by addressing non-adherence in patients. The MSF data collated from KEM has shown that 90% of the patients were responding to the treatment offered under the national programme as their viral loads were suppressed."
78,12,2017,Adolescents with HIV will now have a reason to smile,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/adolescents-with-hiv-will-now-have-a-reason-to-smile/articleshow/61871700.cms,"PANAJI: In a unique attempt to provide a support system to adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV), a club dedicated to them will be set up at Agasaim, on Friday.Bloom and Blossom, as the group will be called, will aim at giving such adolescents a safe space while also ensuring that their health is optimised. It has been conceptualised by Peter Borges, founder and CEO of the NGO, Human Touch. “This club will help young people allocate time to tend to their emotional needs at a critical juncture in their life, where establishing peer relationships is particularly important. Unlike other teenagers, there is a heightened risk among HIV+ adolescents to feel excluded and isolated. They are at a far greater risk of not seeking treatment, or dropping out once treatment begins,” Borges says.There are around 310 children known to be living with HIV in the state, of which around 200 belong to the adolescent age group (10-19 years). A majority live with their families, sometimes with single parents and extended families. There are also a substantial number of orphans, close to 40 of whom are housed in three institutions in Tivim, Cavelossim and Rivona. Although ALHIV still face great difficulties in having their voices heard, they also have the potential to be powerful agents of change. Bloom and Blossom, which will conduct its meetings in the Human Touch office at Agasaim, could be a good place to start. “They will better placed to advocate issues that concern them and should be given opportunities for engagement in policy-making, too. In recent years, discussions on the health such youngsters have taken centrestage at many national and international forums. There is also a demand for a revitalized community-wide response to support them,” Borges says.“Adequate treatment, literacy and the right to make decisions about one’s own health are central to empowering ALHIV to be able to engage in decisions about their own care. Finding innovative ways to establish youth as actors in their own treatment would have onward benefits, as they gain confidence navigating healthcare systems. It would also promote adherence and retention,” Borges adds."
79,12,2017,Goa positive about drop in HIV cases,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-positive-about-drop-in-hiv-cases/articleshow/61871706.cms,"With one more month to year-end, Goa is optimistic that 2017 will reveal a decline in the number of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) cases compared to last year. In 2016, 378 people tested positive for HIV while 317 tested positive till October this year. AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) cases, however, have already seen a rise during the first 10 months this year compared to last year. There have been 25 deaths due to AIDS till October this year, compared to 31 last year. “What should happen is that anyone who has the slightest doubt should subject themselves to testing,” an official from the Goa State Aids Control Society said.Around 40% of HIV positive people don’t know their HIV status and are hidden in the community, either due to ignorance or the stigma associated with it. “Earlier people would be hesitant to get themselves tested because they thought there was no hope. Now they know there’s treatment available and there’s some light at the end of the tunnel,” the official said, adding that only once the stigma goes away will more people step forward to get themselves tested.Thanks to the test-and-treat policy rolled out by the government in April this year, those who have tested positive for HIV can avail free antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the past, the therapy was provided only when a person’s CD4 count went below normal and if it was clinically felt that his resistance had gone down.“Now every person who tests positive can be put on treatment, ensuring that his viral load is kept low, thereby preventing him from contracting AIDS early on,” he said, citing examples of people who have lived up to 25 years after being tested HIV+."

As far as mortality due to HIV is concerned, it has declined threefold in last 13 years.The facts were revealed by Dr Pramod Deoraj, an official from Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) on the occasion of World AIDS Day that falls on December 1.Deoraj said, “The high rates of positive cases and deaths in the past were because earlier we had fewer ART centres, less medicine stock and not every HIV positive patient received free drugs from government due to criteria called CD4.”An official notification on May 5 this year made it possible to “treat all” living with HIV regardless of their CD4 cell count (a test that measures the strength of one’s immune system). It has further contributed to decline of new cases.Deoraj said, “Within the state there were about 23,000 HIV+ve patients who couldn’t get the treatment because of this criteria. With the new guidelines, the government has CD4 clause and we are having a good start. In the last six months we have reached out to over 15,000 patients through ART centres and have been able to begin treatment of about 8000.”Deoraj said, “In 2010, we used to record about 52,000 new HIV positive cases every year. Last year, the figure fell to 22,000. We have observed that the number is falling by about 1000 to 1200 every year. In 2004 the death rate for HIV positive patients used to be 15% and that has fallen to 5% now.”The state government has total 73 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres where free drugs are given. Three centres in Nagpur district are in the medicine department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) and another at a public health facility in Kamptee.Officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Tanuja Fale said, “In the district, we also have 21 Integrated Counselling and Testing Center (ICTC) where patients are tested for HIV, counselled and connected with ARTs. In 2015, the district received a mobile van to perform as ICTC in remote areas. Last year, we received another van from the collector.”An RTI query by activist Abhay Kolarkar revealed the ART record of GMCH between the year 2014 and 2016. There is a consistent decline in positive cases here too. The number of deaths came drastically down from 50 to 15 in 2015 but again rose to 30 in 2016."

However, some people living with HIV in Mysuru feel stigmatized as people in the medical profession themselves are looking at them as ‘aliens’ by delaying treatment.Sources in Ananda Jyothi Positive Network, an organization of positive people working for the welfare of community members, claimed that doctors are avoiding treating HIV patients. They claim to have come across two cases wherein HIV patients were asked to wait for some time to get treatment after the doctors learnt they were HIV patients.The first patient, who had a heart ailment, was asked to come back after a few weeks. The second patient, a woman who was suffering from uterine prolapse, was told there were no beds at the hospital, they said.Deepa, a non-community coordinator, claimed that doctors do not deny providing treatment but delay it. “They also ask for proof whether they had given them in writing that they wouldn’t treat them. We have intervened and in talks with authorities concerned to get them treatment,” she added.Treatment for co-infection like tuberculosis is easily available and it is not the case for co-morbidities like tooth ache, heart and kidney problems, claim sources. After the National Community Care Centre scheme, which reserved 10 beds for HIV patients and offered free treatment, was scrapped in 2012, treatment for HIV patients has taken a beating, sources add.AIDS programme Officer (in-charge) Dr C Suvarna admitted that the issue of delayed treatment was raised at a meeting but specific instances were not brought up to them. “No one can deny treatment and in such a case one can complain to us,” she said. The officer however claimed that for medical reasons treatment could have been delayed or postponed. “Moreover, surgeries have to be done under extra care and it would take some time. We can analyse if the case was brought to us and whether it is ‘willful’ delay or not,” she said.Stats:** A total of 18,175 persons have been affected with HIV in Mysuru district.

The process of initiating every HIV positive individual on antiretroviral treatment (ART), however, has been fraught with difficulties ranging from refusals and adherence issues to side-effects.In Maharashtra, around 33,500 people were identified in the pre-ART category that includes those who are positive but not in immediate need of medicines due to good immunity levels. Out of that, the state has managed to contact around 21,000 people and initiate less than half on treatment. Earlier, ART would be given only after the CD4 levels dropped to 500.“Those with higher immunity levels are reluctant to take medicines daily on the ground that they do not suffer from any symptoms. We are reaching out to them through our social workers and NGOs,” said Parimal Singh, project director of Maharashtra District Aids Control Society (MSACS). The WHO had recommended the treat-all policy so that people living with HIV could lead healthier lives and cut down transmissibility.The Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) has been facing similar issues. Around 1,400 patients from the city have been added under the treat-all policy. “Adherence is a problem that we are trying to tackle. Under the treat-all policy, even those with higher CD4 levels are started on treatment. Some of them have stopped treatment after suffering side-effects. Their contention being they were healthier before starting ART,” said Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS. “However, to prevent problems of drug resistance, we have started rigorous counselling before initiation of treatment,” she said.Meanwhile, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) administrator Mark Green, while speaking at an event on Friday, said, “New HIV infections in India have reduced by 66% since 2000.

An ART facility in GB Nagar district hospital in Sector 30 was closed in 2014 after a centre was opened in Ghaziabad’s MMG Hospital. ART is an effective treatment of HIV patients which slows down the rate of the virus copying itself, using a combination of several anti-retroviral medicines.Absence of all sampling facilities and only one designated day in a week for screening at MMG Hospital, patients from GB Nagar often go to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital (LBSH) in Delhi.“We do not have too many HIV patients in the district and since, Ghaziabad is the nearest district, it was considered that it can cater to the neighbouring districts of Gautam Budh Nagar and Hapur too. In case, the patients feel that the facility in the neighbouring district requires to be enhanced, we will write to the state government through the senior officials about it,” said additional chief medical officer Shireesh Jain.According to India HIV/AIDS Alliance, which is working on two projects, including Wajood and Samarth, to help the LGBT community in NCR fight with the high prevalence of the infection, it has identified as many as 36 people from the community infected with HIV at their own screening centre.“We have screened as many as 36 HIV patients from our community after which they underwent a test at the integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) of the district hospital in Sector 30. However, they require as many as 11 more tests till their ART treatment is prescribed by a doctor,” Deepak Kumar, chief manager (UP and NCR), Samarth, told TOI.“For the crucial CD4 count (test for measuring the CD4 cells in the blood) on which the number of medicines provided under the ART treatment depends, is available at the MMG Hospital once a week. However, patients are not ready to go to Ghaziabad due to the distance, they usually prefer to go to Delhi,” he said.When contacted, Dr JK Tyagi, chief medical superintendent, MMG Hospital, said while the hospital has staff to see around 400 patients, they have around 1,300 patients undergoing treatment at the centre. “We have written to the state government multiple times to increase the staff strength so that the number of days for examination be increased,” he said."

The collector referred to the success of the Measles-Rubella vaccination campaign in this connection.According to the officials, there are 1709 people who have the infection in Kannur whereas it is 1424 in Kasaragod. In Kozhikode, there 4614 confirmed cases while in Wayanad it is 283 and in Malappuram 606. However, the data need not exactly be the number of patients from that district only, especially in the districts where there are medical colleges, because in the earlier times the facility for HIV test was available only in medical colleges, according to the officials."

HIV infection among women before their marriage is very negligible. Most of them come under the age group of below 30 years. The number has come down to 0.03 %,” Dr S M Manivannan, district program manager (DPM) of district AIDS prevent and control unit (DAPCU), told TOI on Saturday. He also said that out of 100 children born to HIV infected mothers, 30% to 35% were infected till 2013. “The chances of mother to children transmission declined after we started prescribing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to pregnant mothers also. We gradually brought the number from 10% to 4% and now reached 2%. The mission is to achieve 0% mother to children transmission,” said Dr Manivannan. In Trichy district, a total of 1 23,381 people underwent HIV tests in 2016-17. The tests revealed that 640 were infected by HIV. District AIDS prevention control unit said that the number of HIV infection dropped to 0.5 % from 0.7% in 2015-16. The statistics showed a declining trend about HIV infection in Trichy and that the number of HIV infection diagnosed through integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) was 0.82 % in 2014-15. The number of HIV infected patients which was high in 2008 and 2009 gradually declined, claimed DAPCU officials. The downward trend was attributed to awareness among people about safety measures such as condoms. “The single most important occupation affected by the HIV remains the driver profession. Previously, long distance drivers were vulnerable to HIV infection because of their long separation from their wives and the prevalence of female sex workers. Now, all kinds of drivers have come in the vulnerable group,” said Manivannan. Around 11,000 people were undergoing HIV screening test in all the 33 ICTC in Trichy every month. Not all of them were coming on suspicion of HIV infection, several of them with chronic illness and tuberculosis were referred by doctors for HIV screening. Pre-surgical screening of patients and pregnant women also added up to the total number."

In South Africa it is increasingly leading to brain infections. Doctors claimed that HIV/AIDS is also increasing the incidence of strokes and epilepsy.Dr John Ouma, of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told TOI that though the commonest of infection that comes with HIV is tuberculosis, HIV infection and seizures were also related. “Hence, epilepsy was a common disease. One in hundred persons suffers from epilepsy at some point of time in life. In fact, Neuro-AIDS is a commonly used word in South Africa and neuro-cognitive disorders caused due AIDS are a topic of research,” he said.Dr Ouma is in the city for the five-day annual conference of the Neurological Society of India being hosted by the Nagpur Neuro Society. Dr Ouma said that Africa had a very small number of neurologists and neurosurgeons. Hence, a large number of the patients from Africa come to India for treatment. “India has a majority of the advanced equipment and innovation in the field. The treatment here is available at less than one fourth the cost of the developed countries. Hence a lot of medical tourism happens between India and South Africa,” he said. Medical tourism, Dr Ouma said, was possible also due to the liberal policies of the Indian government unlike the USA which asks for “cumbersome paper work”.Dr Ouma said that despite all the developments in the brain sciences, man seems to have understood less than 5% of the functioning of the brain. “There is so much of scope for research in neurosciences, neurobiology, neuropathology etc that amazing work can be done by neurologists and neurosurgeons in future when they understand the brain more,” he said."

Soon, other HIV-positive patients, too, joined him to protest against the hospital staff.Talking to the TOI, the youth said, “I had recently got an implant in my left leg, which was giving some trouble. When I went to Dr Davinder, orthopaedic surgeon of civil hospital, he refused to admit and treat me. He asked me to go back to my hometown in UP from where I got the implant.”Dr US Sooch, district programme officer, HIV/ Aids prevention, said, “The patient came to me with a complaint and I told Dr Davinder to admit him. The patient also gave a complaint to Dr Meenu Singh, deputy director, Punjab State Aids Control Society. But he was not admitted.”“It was only after I went on a hunger strike and an NGO, Dr Kotinis, offered help that the hospital admitted me,” the youth added. Dr Inderjit from NGO Dr Kotinis said, “The HIV-positive patient has been complaining for the past five days that he is being denied treatment. Left with no option, he went on a hunger strike and didn’t even take his HIV medicine. Then, the senior medical officer came and the patient was admitted. Many other HIV patients joined him in his protest and complained about doctors and nurses’ misbehaviour.”The protest, which started at 10am, was called off at 2pm. While refuting the allegations, senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Kulwinder Singh said, “Dr Davinder gave him antibiotics for five days, and he was asked to come for further treatment after the dose. We had asked the patient for his medical records. As he could not give the records, he was asked to take treatment from the doctor who did the implant.“He was never denied treatment. Every day so many HIV and hepatitis-C patients are treated, why will he be denied treatment? Moreover, he was checked in OPD and given antibiotics. But the patient wanted to be admitted, but we can’t do that unnecessarily.”"

The woman from Karnataka, in her 40s, came to know about the HIV infection only after tests were conducted by the hospital during delivery. When the hospital checked the blood samples of her husband, he too was found to be HIV positive. It is too early to identify if their child, who is just 13-days old, has contracted the infection. Both husband and wife work here as labourers. The incident came to the attention of women’s commission member Shahida Kamal after some activists informed her about the incident. “On World AIDS Day, I had said that the commission would take up cases of destitute HIV positive patients. After reading my statement in newspapers, some people called me and sought help. Since Gandhi Bhavan has been taking care of three people living with AIDS for several years, I contacted them. They agreed to accept the family,” she said. Kamal said that the woman had no idea about AIDS. “They have no much idea how serious the situation is. A test could be conducted on the child only after 45 days,” she said. Women’s commission chairperson MC Josephine and member Shahida Kamal visited them at SAT hospital before they were taken to Pathanapuram. Josephine said that the commission would take care of their needs. She said that commission also intervened to prevent social ostracization of the family."

Meenakshi Bhattacharya, the nodal officer at the ART centre in the GMCH said, “Keeping in line with the theme, the department is committed to provide quality treatment to all patients with the aim to eradicate the fatal disease.”According to studies, the prevalence of HBV is high in HIV positive individuals and women are more commonly infected than men. Whereas men are more commonly infected by HCV. However, the prevalence of HCV is lower than HBV. Consequently, screening HIV positive individuals for the hepatitis viruses is crucial.GMCH dean Kanan Yelikar encouraged the HIV positive patients to take consistent treatment from ART centre and to take regular medication without disruptions as advised.

The hospital reported him to be HIV positive.Ahmad had applied for a job in Dubai and the test was part of his fitness requirement. However, two subsequent tests in Gurgaon and Uttarakhand reported him to be HIV negative and perfectly fit. The executive committee of the DMC examined a complaint from Ahmad, forwarded by the Medical Council of India, alleging negligence in the preparation of HIV test report by the medical centre.Dr Girish Tyagi, registrar of DMC, said despite repeated notices sent to the superintendent of the said facility, they did not get written statement and medical records pertaining to the treatment, tests and investigation of Ahmad.“This recalcitrant attitude of the medical centre is highly deplorable and reflects poorly on the management... Prima facie it appears that the complainant has been victim of incompetence of the centre as he has been wrongfully reported to be having HIV positive and declared unfit vide their report February 1, 2017 and made to suffer because of that,” the DMC wrote in its letter to the DGHS and sought closure of the facility.The DMC order said stringent action including closure of the centre is needed as it is apprehended that such a centre may not be equipped or have proper qualified doctors to run lab tests."

The 36-year-old mother of two dug into his bag to find a sari, a lipstick and wilted flowers. Her husband, she later found, was a bisexual cross-dresser. Four years on, Savitha remains married to the same man. Her voice — narrating her husband’s affairs with other men — is among those documented by researchers who studied HIV-related risks among married men who have sex with men (MSM) and their wives. According to a 2012 study by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), MSM are at 12 to15 times higher risk of contracting HIV compared to other men. The recent study found that the HIV-related risks for the spouses of MSM were multiple, yet they are not covered under any intervention programmes of the government. Forty six MSMs were interviewed across five states including the cities of Chennai and Madurai. Of these, 13 women were aware of their husbands’ sexual orientation. Men in these marriages were the primary decision-makers about sex and condom use.""The men used condoms inconsistently with their male partners,"" said Sunil Solomon of Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a co-author of the study. ""The women in these relationships are vulnerable but rarely feature in the country’s HIV intervention programmes. The initiatives mostly address the experiences and perspectives of husbands and their male partners, but not their wives,"" said Solomon, who facilitated the interviews for two teams from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Durham University. The few women who were interviewed said they came to know about their husbands’ same-sex preference by accident. The men in the study reported having multiple male, and a few female, extramarital sexual partners.Forty-year-old Vasanth* from Hyderabad, who blamed his family for forcing him to marry, was among those who had not disclosed their orientation to their wives. ""If I tell my wife about my relationship with men, she may harm herself. What will happen if she tells our families? I may be making a mistake, but I cannot trouble her. So my relationship remains a secret,"" he said. The study pointed to the high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM and a higher prevalence of HIV among married MSM than unmarried ones. The pressure on them to conform to heteronormative masculine norms leads to hurried and unsafe sex with multiple partners. Many MSMs are also victims of blackmail. ""Their male partners threaten to expose them to their wives if they don’t listen to their demands. In the process, they end up having sex without protection,"" said Jaya, general manager of Sahodaran, which operates a helpline for the LGBT community in Chennai. Some of the couples surveyed for the study had separated after the women got to know about their husbands’ sexual preferences, while some remained married but no longer had a sex. However, a majority of participants continued to have sex both with their wives and partners. A few of them said they encouraged their wives to have extramarital relationships as they were not attracted to them. Women said they remain in these marriages due to cultural and economic pressures, and some for their children.Some women, described pressure from their husbands to have anal sex against their wishes. ""Accounts from both husbands and wives in our study indicate that husbands are the primary sexual decision-makers; some men clearly consider it a right. The men interviewed said they did not feel that using condom with their wives was ""necessary"", even when they had unsafe sex with other partners. ‘I have a medical check-up every three months, so what is the need to use condom with my wife?’ asked a 27-year-old bisexual man in Madurai. Condoms were only seen as a birth control measure and not to prevent sexually transmitted diseases,"" said Solomon. ""But, several participants we interviewed were actively seeking a pregnancy at the time of the interview, and consequently avoided using condoms with their wives,"" he added. The study said there is an urgent need for interventions to address HIV-related risk posed to wives without the unwanted disclosure of husbands’ same-sex behaviour. ""For instance, engagement of these husbands in pre-exposure prophylaxis (taking HIV medicines daily to lower chances of getting infected) could reduce the men’s own risk of HIV, and thereby also reduce the risk of onward transmission to their wives."" Researchers also suggested forming more support groups for these women.(* Names have been changed)"

The Haridwar jail houses 1,175 prisoners, including 60 women, and samples were collected from all of them, including 450 undertrials, in July 2017. The jail administration on Sunday said that all the affected inmates are undertrials and most of them are accused in theft cases. The administration, however, added that the virus didn’t spread inside the jail and the undertrials were already affected. Jailor of Haridwar district jail, S M Singh, said, “The 21 male inmates, aged between 25 and 27, were already affected with HIV. However, they didn’t know that they were carrying the virus. Seven of the 21 are, at present, out on bail and 14 others are being treated by the AIDS control society. They are all small burglars and were arrested in various cases of thefts. All are uneducated and belong to poor families.” He added that most of them are drug addicts, and in all probability, they got infection through intravenous (IV) drug use. Meanwhile, the district administration has asked the jail authority to take proper measures in the matter. District magistrate Deepak Rawat said, “It is a serious matter and all possible steps are being taken to check the spread of the infection within the jail. Proper medical treatment is being administered to all the affected inmates. The narcotic bureau of Dehradun has also examined the report.” The use of IV drugs such as heroin, cocaine and crystal methamphetamines have increased in the past couple of years in Haridwar, especially in the slum areas of the district. Social worker Vishal Garg said, “IV drugs are easily available at every other medical store in Haridwar. The health department is also not taking any measures to curb the use and sale of the drugs. Earlier, mostly homeless youths used IV drugs but now youngsters living in the slums have also started buying these drugs, which is a major cause of HIV spread.” Amarjeet Singh, SHO of Jwalapur police station, said, “A packet of IV drugs is sold for Rs 250 and because of its easy availability and low cost people are buying it. We had recently taken action against two medical stores in Jwalapur area for selling intravenous drugs used by addicts. Three people were also arrested.” MS Nawaz"

The health of her husband, who was also HIV positive, was deteriorating. Doctors told her his death was imminent. So, the Bandra (E) reside-nt spent the next five months nu-rsing her bedridden husband, worrying about the HIV status of their three daughters and dipping into the family’s meagre financial reserves to fund their treatment. “I was sick of living,” recalls Khan. “I even tried committing suicide by drinking phenyl.” Khan agreed to TOI using her name and photo. That’s when another HIV patient who saw her crying directed her to Committed Communities Development Trust (CCDT), an organization committed to developing and implementing a home-based care programme for families living with HIV or AIDS. Today, the organization, which has been around since 1990, caters to 600 families across Mumbai by providing psychosocial, nutritional, educational, legal and medical support. “When we started this work, we found that lots of children with HIV positive parents were institutionalized because their parents could no longer work and look after them,” explains Poonam Patkar, who has been with CCDT for 10 years. “So, we decided to provide home-based care in order to strengthen the capacity of the family.” Khan was initially hesitant to approach CCDT fearing her privacy would be breached. But it turned out to be the best decision she’d made. “Since my husband was bedridden, I’d given up hope of continuing my children’s education in a good, private school,” she recalls. “But CCDT helped me with the fees.” They also took her husband to a hospital and got him treatment. It turned out his symptoms were more a result of tuberculosis than HIV. He’s now back at work. “People from my community wouldn’t help me because of the stigma surrounding my illness,” says Khan, “but CCDT took me in as one of their own.” CCDT teaches families about the importance of taking antiretroviral drugs regularly and what do in case a HIV positive family member gets a cut or has an open wound. “We give them a first aid kit and teach them to use gloves,” says Patkar. “If families can’t afford gloves, we tell them to use plastic bags.” They also provide information about treatments. For instance, Khan had no idea that government hospitals provided free antiretroviral treatment and used up all her savings at a private hospital. Most families that CCDT works with have a monthly income of about Rs 5,000-6,000 and are daily wagers. This makes CCDT’s nutritional kit of 13 items, including jaggery, peanuts, oil and soyabean, a godsend because it helps supplement their diet when they have to stay home from work because they aren’t feeling well.To help patients recover hope after being diagnosed, CCDT has set up family support groups that meet every month. “When I joined CCDT’s support group I heard other people sharing their stories and after such a long time…I began to feel hopeful about the future,” CCDT quoted Khan as saying in a press release.

During blood tests, it was found that the person was HIV positive. The kin of the person alleged on Friday that he and his family members were asked by a junior doctor on December 27 to leave the hospital after the test results. “I have submitted a formal complaint to the superintendent’s office. No doctor has either attended to my brother even after I submitted the letter three days back nor have we been assigned a date for the operation. We cannot afford treatment in a private hospital. Now, all we can do is wait for the administration to take notice,” said the person’s brother.PMCH deputy superintendent Dr R K Jamaiyar said it was the duty of the hospital to treat the person. “We don’t have a special OT as like in the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS). After operating upon any such person, we close the OT for two days, sterilize it and provide the doctors all the necessary kit,” Dr Jamaiyar said. He said the doctors also suggest the family concerned to get the person operated upon at IGIMS, which has all the facilities. When contacted, principal in charge of PMCH, Dr Khurshid Alam said a committee would be formed to conduct an inquiry into the case. “I have already asked orthopaedic department HoD Dr Vijay Gupta to submit to me the details of the treatment plan for the person,” he added.“The committee will conduct the necessary investigation and take appropriate action in case there is any fault on the part of any doctor or employee of the hospital,” Dr Alam said.
