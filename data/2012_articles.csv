Tubectomy is surgical procedure for permanent contraception to prevent future pregnancies in women. The diagnosis left the counsellor Piu Mukherjee so startled that she immediately called up the block medical officer (health) Dr Saswata Barenya, who rushed to the hospital after informing the health department. The department also reacted strongly with socio-medical significance of such cases. Additional chief medical officer (health) of Hooghly Dr Jagannath Mondal also rushed to the hospital. He also picked up district medical officer (Dhaniakhali) Dr Tanmoy Ghosh on his way to the hospital. The woman was separated from the group that queued up for tubectomy and was taken to the operating theatre. The surgery was done using the mini-lab process. The woman was taken to the operation theatre where Dr Mondal and Dr Ghosh carried out the surgery on her following the mini-lab process. The doctors used disposable instruments and wore anti-flash goggles, surgical gowns, special masks etc and special surgical aprons to prevent contamination. Doctors remained anxious till the surgery was over. It took 10 minutes to complete the surgery succefully. After the operation, the woman was sent to her home in Tarakeswar block. The block medical officer Saswata Barenya said that the husband of the woman was the carrier of the virus. He had infected the woman. The incident left a wide area in Tarakeswar nervous. According to Dr Barenya, in Tarakeswar, Chanditala, Khanakul (I&amp;II), Goghat and Pandua there has been a rapid growth in the number of HIV positive patients in the surrounding areas. TNNIt is high time such growth rate is reversed. Tarakeswar Block Development officer have decided to carry out a thorough investigation into this sudden spurt of HIV infected patients in the area."
1,1,2012,She is a ray of hope for the HIV-affected,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/She-is-a-ray-of-hope-for-the-HIV-affected/articleshow/11321552.cms," COIMBATORE: For many in the society, HIV/AIDS affliction is a stigma; but, not for Meenakshi. An HIV affected woman from Coimbatore, she has taken it her life mission to instill hope in the minds of people in similar conditions. Meenakshi, who is in her 30s, and her organization, Kovai District HIV Nalla Sangam (CD HANS), have played an important role in encouraging HIV/AIDS-affected persons to come out and form a network to fight discrimination. ""HIV affected individuals face a lot of problems. We came out with this initiative so that the affected could have a space to share their common problems,"" she says. With seven people on board, they started CD HANS as a network of HIV infected people. ""Now there are around 2000 members in our network in the district"", she says. Today, the organization conducts peer group programmes, support group activities and other joint initiatives. She says that peer group programmes help patients reconcile with the issues related to the disease. ""When everyone hears each other's story, it helps them garner a lot of emotional support,"" she explains. HIV patients are at first put through a get together that happens twice a month. Then, they meet during alternate months. ""The frequent get-togethers will help people overcome the fears and myths associated. With anti-retroviral treatment (ART), an infected person can live a normal life for more than 30 years. Most would have panicked and lost hope of living after detecting themselves to be HIV infected. They find it a new birth"", she says. Meenakshi is proud that many have found new lives through her group. ""Fortunately, we have plenty of financial assistance programmes and other initiatives. Through self-help groups of the HIV affected, many have started their own initiatives."" Meenakshi, who had to drop her studies at 9th standard, has since completed an MA in Sociology from Anna University. ""I did this to develop my counseling skills. Assistance and consoling from our part helps patients more than the effort of a normal counselor,"" she says. CD HANS have also arranged marriages among the HIV-affected. ""This year we conducted five marriages. We do not encourage it unless the families from both sides agree to their alliance,"" she said. Aji Mary Asha, a counsellor of the government-run Integrated Counseling Testing Centre (ICTC), says the efforts of Meenakshi and her colleagues are helping the patients to speak out. ""This helps those who feel depressed after knowing the disease,"" she told TOI."
2,1,2012,51-year-old HIV+ man infects thousands in US,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/51-year-old-HIV-man-infects-thousands-in-US/articleshow/11322515.cms,"LONDON: An HIV-positive man in US has potentially infected thousands of people — by having unprotected sex so he could spread the disease, according to a media report. David Dean Smith, 51, turned himself in to a Michigan police station last week — after claiming to have slept with 3,000 men and women over several years. A detective investigating the case said: “He says he intentionally attempted to spread the disease to kill people” . It is unclear when Smith was diagnosed with HIV, but he claims to have known full well what he was doing when he had unprotected sex with many partners. While he claims that there may be thousands of victims, so far he has been arraigned and charged with two counts of AIDS-sexual penetration with an uninformed partner, ‘Daily Mail’ reported. "
3,1,2012,Unravelled: How HIV hits body’s defences,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Unravelled-How-HIV-hits-bodys-defences/articleshow/11333677.cms,"WASHINGTON: Scientists in the US claim to have unravelled how HIV hijacks the body’s own defences to promote infection, a finding which may pave the way for curbing the spread of AIDS. A team at University of California, led by Nevan Krogan, has described how HIV commandeers restriction factors — a class of human proteins that evolved to block viruses — to weaken the body’s defences and enhance the virulence of HIV infection, the ‘Nature’ journal reported. “One of the keys to HIV’s success is how quickly it can evolve new attack strategies — and the way in which it uses our own proteins against us is a prime example of that,” said Dr Krogan. He added: “However, now that we’ve shed light on this process, we are one step closer to developing new drugs that will help us pull ahead in this evolutionary arms race.” AIDS has killed over 25 million across world since first being identified 30 years ago.

4,1,2012,Human trials for HIV vaccine get under way,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Human-trials-for-HIV-vaccine-get-under-way/articleshow/11359145.cms,"LONDON: Scientists are carrying out what they claim is the first clinical trial of an injectable vaccine for HIV which causes AIDS. A team from Imperial College, Hull York Medical School, Medical Research Council Clinical Trial Unit and Infectious Disease Research Institute is evaluating whether the vaccine is safe for use in human volunteers. The vaccine contains trimeric HIV envelope protein (gp140) which can target the virus’ most virulent strain Clade C that has caused the greatest number of HIV infections around the globe, infecting half of the 34 million people with HIV. The trial, which is funded by the Wellcome Trust and goes by the name MUCOVAC2, is evaluating a vaccine that contains the HIV trimeric gp140 protein CN54, representative of Clade C strains of the virus. This clade of HIV is the most prevalent type of virus in Sub-Saharan Africa and responsible for the greatest number of infections globally. The trimeric protein represents the major target for antibodies on the viral surface. The vaccine candidate will be formulated with an adjuvant — GLA — developed to enhance immune responsiveness following intramuscular injection. GLA formulations have been previously tested clinically with promising results. The scientists have enrolled 36 healthy, HIV-negative women aged 18-45 years at St George’s University of London and the HYMS Experimental Medicine Unit at York Hospital. "
5,1,2012,India in fray to create elusive HIV vaccine,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/India-in-fray-to-create-elusive-HIV-vaccine/articleshow/11369310.cms,"NEW DELHI: Could an antibody from the blood of an Indian HIV patient help create the elusive HIV vaccine? (Antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances). The hunt has begun to identify 100 volunteers belonging to a rare group of HIV infected patients who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART). These antibodies in their blood are the ones that bars HIV from entering their blood cells and replicating, thereby progressing to AIDS. Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus and help create the elusive vaccine. This is part of International Aids Vaccine Initiative’s (IAVI) programme called Protocol G, a global hunt for such antibodies launched in 2006. So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) have been identified. A bNAb is an antibody capable of stopping a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells. “Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These parts are essential to the virus’s ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target,” experts said. Just a few weeks ago, department of biotechnology (DBT) cleared the proposal to roll out Protocol G in the country. It is being implemented by IAVI and YRG Care from Chennai – the same organization that isolated the first HIV case in India in 1986. The blood samples collected from the 100 volunteers will be tested at Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), which is being built in Gurgaon. IAVI’s India chief Dr Rajat Goyal told TOI that “This is a landmark project for India. We are presently identifying volunteers, who are at least 18 years, infected with HIV at least three years ago but has not received ART. By April, samples will be picked up and tested against a standard panel of HIV isolates by the end of 2012. We will then know whether there is a population of interest from whom these bNAb can be identified and characterized.” Careful study of bNAbs is expected to reveal vulnerabilities of the different types of HIV. Most importantly, scientists expect that they can use information about how bNAbs bind to HIV to construct immunogens — the active ingredients of vaccines — that elicit similar antibodies. The more such antibodies researchers have in hand, the more clues they can get about how best to target HIV with a vaccine. The project has tested HIV patients in Thailand, the UK, the US, Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Australia and Zambia to identify bNAbs. HIV infects 7,100 people daily. The quest to develop an AIDS vaccine has consumed scientists for 25 years since the discovery of HIV. Scientists say HIV is the most mutable virus ever encountered. A number of different subtypes of the virus, known as clades, circulate in different regions of the world. Within those clades there is considerable variability, and, beyond that, the virus mutates furiously within the people it has infected. Second, because no one is known to have cleared an HIV infection, scientists do not know which elements of the immune response must be engaged to control the virus — and thus are uncertain how to replicate such responses. The immune system has a very narrow window of opportunity in which to neutralize HIV before the virus establishes a lifelong infection. "
6,1,2012,Marriage mela for HIV/AIDS patients goes off well,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/Marriage-mela-for-HIV/AIDS-patients-goes-off-well/articleshow/11405541.cms," SURAT: Rohit (name changed) (27), a resident of Rajkot, had lost all hope to find a life partner after he tested positive for HIV two years ago. He was not knowing that his life was about to take a U turn. Thanks to a marriage mela organized by Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+) in the city on Saturday, Rohit has found an HIV positive life partner in Reshma (name changed). The 31-year-old woman is a resident of Vadodara. Nearly 159 candidates suffering from HIV/AIDS from 24 districts of Gujarat participated in the fourth marriage mela organized jointly by the GSNP+ and Samast Patidar Samaj at Katargam. Rasik Bhua of GSNP+ said over 91 couples suffering from HIV/AIDS have tied nuptial knots at the marriage melas organized by them in the last three years. ""There were 132 male and 27 female candidates at the marriage mela. After formal introduction of individual candidates, the fair was open for the candidates to mutually select their partners,"" Bhua said. GSNP+ is the only non-governmental organization (NGO) working for the upliftment of people living with HIV/AIDS in the state. The volunteers of GSNP+ have been doing rigorous work in every district of the state to mobilize young, widow, separated and divorced candidates suffering from HIV/AIDS to come forward and find their life partners. In Gujarat, only 12 per cent women living with HIV/AIDS apply for marriage proposals as compared to male candidates. Last year, GSNP+ had received a total of 262 applications out of which there were only 45 women candidates. ""It is not that there is less number of women living with HIV/AIDS in Gujarat. But, they are not willing to come out fearing social stigma,"" president of GSNP+ Daxa Patel said. Since the number of women is always less at the marriage melas, members of the fair sex get the privilege to choose. The male candidates are introduced and given an identity number, which the women candidates take note of if they want to. ""Such marriage melas for the people living with HIV/AIDS is a positive development in the society where many, including divorcees, widows and widowers, are compelled to live a lonely existence,"" Patel said."

8,1,2012,HIV 10 times more prevalent among migrants than general population,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-10-times-more-prevalent-among-migrants-than-general-population/articleshow/11456671.cms,"NEW DELHI: Migration is fuelling India’s HIV epidemic. National AIDS Control Organisation’s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among migrants — 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population. With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. NACO has, therefore, identified 108 railway stations – which are both source and destination of migrants travelling in search of work. These are now the focus of the country’s anti-HIV fight. Red Ribbon Express (RRE), which chugs out of Delhi on Thursday, will stop at most of these 108 identified stations to test migrants for HIV besides carrying out counselling and spreading anti-HIV messages. During it’s year-long journey, RRE will traverse through 23 states, cover 30,000 km and stop at 162 stations. Speaking to TOI, a NACO official said, “Migrants are one of the major focus areas this time with the RRE. Last year, RRE stopped at 152 stations and reached out to 8 million people directly. This time, around 30-40 stops will be to mainly address migrants.” NACO has identified 122 districts with high out-migration across 11 states which are on priority for starting up community level interventions. Another 75 important transit locations have been identified across these 122 districts from where these migrants usually board long distance trains/buses to reach their destinations. Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. It showed that two to four times more number of informal workers had non-regular partners or visited sex workers with only 25% using condoms. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double the national average. According to NACO, the risk of HIV infection for migrants seems to arise from a multitude of factors -- risky behaviour, lack of social and economic security and involvement in peer driven risk taking activities. In a recent study by UNDP (through Population Council), the risk of HIV among migrants was reported to be 1.68 times more likely than non-migrants. Majority of migrants are also often poorly educated, with majority reporting less than five years of formal education. This contributes to limited knowledge of HIV transmission. A study conducted in 30 villages in the northern parts of Karnataka revealed that 40% of single men and 35% of married migrant men had non-marital sexual relationships in the last 12 months. For a long time, India has lived with the belief that migrants are at risk only at destination sites when they are away from home and their spouse. However, recent evidence proves otherwise. Returned migrants continue to fuel the epidemic since most infected migrants tend to return to source when they are sick. A study of married men found returned migrants were 3.86 times as likely to be HIV positive as compared to active married migrant men. Among men reporting sex with a non-spousal unpaid female sex partner in the past year, only 19% of men reported consistent condom use. This impacts the women and spouses of informal workers/migrants at the source, making them vulnerable to infections from their husband. RRE has been recognized as the world’s largest mass mobilization drive on HIV. Last year, around 80 lakh people were reached through the train and outreach activities. Around 81,000 district resource persons were trained, 36,000 people got themselves tested for HIV and 28,000 people received general health check-up services. Impact assessment of RRE indicated that the comprehensive knowledge of routes of HIV transmission, methods of prevention, condom use, STI prevention and treatment was significantly higher among respondents exposed to the RRE project compared to those not exposed.

In entire Rajasthan, there is not a single life-saving second line antiretroviral therapy centre, which is why AIDS patients in serious condition here are referred to Delhi or Ahmedabad. The department is working in cooperation with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) to open a facility for the people deprived of second line treatment here. AIDS director PK Sharda said, ""Second line treatment is very expensive. So, with the help of NACO we will set up centres for it in Jaipur and Jodhpur, the process for which has already started."" The doctors claimed due to poor adherence to the treatment regimen, resistance to first line treatment happens. It is very necessary to put such people on second line immediately to save their life. An NGO working in the state, Rajasthan Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS' president Brijesh Dubey said, ""At present such people have to travel to Ahmedabad or Delhi, which is very tiring as they are already weak. So, there is a desperate requirement for second line ART."" So far 39 AIDS patients from SMS hospital's ART centre have been referred to Delhi's second line ART centre. At present, 10 out of them are still on second line ART drugs. Assistant to nodal officer ART, SMS hospital, Dr Harsh Vardhan, said, ""The survival rate at second line ART is more than 65%. It is very necessary to put a person resistant to first line drugs on second line to save his life. The medicines used are very expensive, they, too, will be provided free of cost at the centre."" Sources said the groundwork for opening the second line centre at SMS hospital has been completed as doctors have been trained and some medicines have also arrived. A meeting of the department officials will be held soon to announce the date of opening of the centre."
10,1,2012,Lab technician gets jail for 'declaring' man HIV+,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Lab-technician-gets-jail-for-declaring-man-HIV/articleshow/11482621.cms," NAGPUR: Ad-hoc judge KL Vyas has sentenced a pathology laboratory technician to five years in jail for abetting the suicide of a man who ended life after being informed that he is HIV affected. The court also awarded a compensation of 1 lakh to the man's mother who is his sole survivor. The accused has also been slapped with one-and-half-year jail term and an additional fine of Rs 1,500 following the conviction in different provisions of the Medical Practitioners' Act. The verdict was announced on Thursday. The court held Mahesh Wadnerkar, a diploma holder in medical laboratory technology, guilty for the suicide of Nandakishore Ghorpade who hanged himself after consuming insecticide on March 8, 2006. The incident had taken place at Ambala Deshmukh village in Narkhed. Ghorpade, who was supposed to marry within a fortnight, was told on March 1 that he was infected with HIV, by Wadnerkar of Renuka Pathology Laboratory in Narkhed. Unconfirmed reports say that Wadnerkar was also the owner of the lab. Though a Mumbai-based laboratory clarified the following day that the mandatory tests of HIV were negative for Ghorpade, Wadnerkar apparently held back the information. He also asked Ghorpade to bring Rs 1300 for the report."
11,1,2012,MLC takes up HIV kids' cause,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/MLC-takes-up-HIV-kids-cause/articleshow/11504575.cms," NAGPUR: Around 20,000 school students in the state have to face social stigma because either they or their family members are infected with HIV-AIDS, according to a city MLC who had decided to take up their cause with the government. NG Ganar, MLC from the Teachers' Constituency, said, ""It is the government's job to help these students and also to frame some strict laws regarding their privacy so that they are not discriminated in school."" He adds that the statistics regarding students have been sourced from various government reports. ""There have been incidents where students are refused admission, expelled or ostracized within the school campus but very few of them reach the authorities. What we need is a strong law in place which will ensure that the medical history of students or their parents is not disclosed to the school management at all,"" said Ganar. Dr Milind Mane, who has been working with HIV patients for almost two decades, said a distinction has to be made between affected and infected students. ""HIV affected students are those whose parents are or were infected with the virus. This category may also include students who themselves have been infected with HIV. We do not have medical data about how many students in the state, out of the 20,000 affected, are themselves infected. However the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) says that on an average 11 per cent of HIV affected people in the country are infected,"" said Dr. Mane. There is currently no data available on how many HIV affected students are present in Nagpur. But the fact that discrimination in schools happens in the state has been documented by a national level advocacy group. The Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) prepared a dossier on the discrimination related incidents between 2005-2010 in Maharashtra. The dossier mentions that 10 major incidents related to stigma and discrimination in schools occurred during that time period and Nagpur district is one of the regions where these incidents have occurred. A couple of years the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) started a school exclusively for HIV affected students, but was closed down after opposition. Dr. Mane, said, ""The school was started so that these students would feel more comfortable and that would help them concentrate on their studies only. 27 students had enrolled out of which 17 were infected with HIV. Then there was strong opposition by some NGOs and politicians who said that having a separate school similar to discrimination and eventually it was shut down."" The civic body however denies any political pressure and cites enrolment figures as an issue. Ram Dongarwar, education officer, said, ""Students affected by HIV were chosen from various civic schools and enrolled at this special school located near Indora Chowk. "" However due to low enrolment figures we had to shut it down."" MLC Ganar plans to raise the issue in the next assembly session and pressurize the government in taking some concrete steps to help HIV affected students."

Churu is one of the 108 identified stations in the country which is both an HIV source and a destination of migrant workers. Officials of medical department carried out counselling to persuade people visiting the RRE to undergo HIV testing. The department managed to get the consent of more than 200 persons for HIV testing. “The report of the test will be made available in two or three days from the nearest Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC). It is our effort to test as many people as we can but with the consent of the persons,” said joint director, Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society, Pradeep Choudhary. The RRE was flagged off in Delhi on National Youth Day on January 12. “Through this, we will be able to get a rough idea about the number of people who are living with HIV in the district,” said a medical department official. The officials claimed that more than 3,500 people visited the RRE in Churu. It is the third phase of the RRE launched recently. Last time, it was more women-oriented but this time around it is more focused on youths as it is launched on National Youth Day. "
13,1,2012,"Doctors debate HIV testing, pitfalls",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Doctors-debate-HIV-testing-pitfalls/articleshow/11531053.cms," NAGPUR: A lab technician was recently found conducting HIV diagnosis tests and a patient committed suicide after being informed that he had tested positive. Shockingly, a repeat test had shown that the patient was not HIV positive, but the technician did not reveal this result. With no framework of law governing the testing of HIV-AIDS in the country, it has become the personal responsibility of doctors to keep a check on ethical and legal issues while performing such tests. To avoid more such tragedies in the future, members of the city branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) met to discuss important issues related to HIV tests on Tuesday. Topics like guidelines of governing bodies regarding these tests and the difficulties faced by private practitioners when they suspect HIV positive status of a patients were discussed. Programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Ganesh Parihar introduced the concept of public-private partnership in terms of counselling and testing. ""As testing is voluntary and not mandatory in India, it is of utmost importance for the person undergoing the test to give his consent for it. This consent should be based on proper information,"" he insisted. Parihar also said that doctors who are willing to set up an Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) within their premises can avail free testing kits and training for their staff. Renowned HIV consultant Dr Milind Bhurshundi believed that provider-initiated testing and counselling would give way to more efficient and speedy clinical decisions. ""In some cases, one consent form is used for taking consent on more than one issue. Such hidden consents can't be used for HIV testing. Lack of time, not having a trained counsellor and less infrastructure can hamper doctors despite their willingness to have a counselling and testing centre ,"" he said. ""After consulting all stakeholders over a period of two years, a proposed HIV bill is being prepared,"" he informed. Since these guidelines may soon turn into statutory law, he asked the doctors to be prepared for it. ""When a doctor suspects a patient is suffering from HIV, they just don't know how to handle the situation. What most of us do not realize is the fact that counselling is required even before getting someone tested. Along with passing useful information, it can also help in bringing about behavioural changes in the suspect,"" opined surgeon Dr Ajay Kate. He said the most important factors for conducting such tests are confidentiality, a written consent and empowerment by means of providing information. ""Especially in the case of women, they should be provided the right knowledge on the basis of which they can make an informed decision about their lives,"" he added."

A team comprising Gurgaon police and members of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), Shakti Vahini and the Gurgaon Child Protection Officer, among others, had conducted a raid on the NGO’s premises in Maruti Kunj on Tuesday night. During the raid, 14 HIV-positive children, including 8 girls, were rescued. The police have filed an FIR under Sections 376, 376 (C), 376 (F), 120B, 506 of IPC and 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act against Ankur Gupta and Sunita Gupta, president of the NGO. Sunita Gupta is the mother of the accused. After medical examination eight girls had been relocated to Naz Foundation, Delhi, and the boys’ custody was given to the District Child Protection Officer, Gurgaon, until a suitable shelter was found. Nishi Kant, executive director of Shakti Vahini, said “Two of the rescued girl children complained that they were being sexually abused by Ankur Gupta.

One of the victims is HIV positive. Shockingly, the main accused Ankur Gupta (42) is also HIV positive. Police here said that his mother, who has also been named in the FIR, would soon be arrested. Gupta, manager of Drone Foundation, had been absconding since Tuesday night after police raided the NGO’s premises and rescued the 14 kids, including eight girls. Police have recorded the statements of the two victims (aged 9 and 12). Sources said the victims’ medical reports confirmed sexual abuse. While the 12-year-old girl is HIV positive, the nine-year-old is not and no infection was detected at the time of the medical test. Investigators said the child would be subjected to subsequent tests over the next few months to find out whether she has contracted the virus. Cops said Gupta was nabbed from IFFCO Chowk between 4.30pm and 5pm when he was about to board a bus to Jaipur. “He was hiding behind bushes close to the bus stop and when the bus arrived, he hurriedly tried to board it,” said Arvind Dahiya, SHO of Bhondsi police station. He will be produced before a city court on Friday. DCP (south) Hamid Akhtar said, “We are investigating the role of Ankur’s mother Sunita Gupta. Most likely, she would also be arrested on Friday.” Sunita is the president of Drone Foundation. These two victims had earlier filed a complaint with National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) that they were being sexually abused by Gupta. After the police raid on Tuesday night, the eight girls residing at the Drone Foundation were transferred to Naz Foundation in Delhi. The Gurgaon administration reportedly plans to shift the boys to a protection home in Rewari. A team of officials from state’s health department and State AIDS Control Society from Panchkula is also here to investigate the case. Sunita, however, claimed that her son is innocent and is being framed as a part of conspiracy by a former employee of the NGO. She alleged that the employee’s 14-year-old son and other two inmates had sexually abused the girls sometime back. Consequently, they were thrown out of the home along with the employee. “To take revenge, this employee informed the child right activists,” she alleged. Sunita said that she had given information to police about her son’s whereabouts on Wednesday night. "

Gupta was the manager and caretaker of the shelter home. Gupta was nabbed from IFFCO Chowk by the police on Thursday evening while he was trying to flee to Jaipur on a bus. He was produced in the court of judicial magistrate Ashok Mann around 2pm amid tight security. Gupta, his face covered with a shawl, was whisked away by the police immediately after the hearing. Arvind Dahiya, SHO, Bhondsi police station, said, “We need to interrogate Gupta further in the case.” Gupta’s mother, Sunita Gupta, also a co-accused in the case and the president of Drone Foundation, could not be arrested until the filing of this report. Dahiya said an investigation was on and the future course of action would depend on that. "

In 1986, Dr Solomon, a microbiologist with the Government General Hospital, Chennai, announced that six women sex workers had been found to be infected by the virus. None of the women is alive to tell about the trauma they underwent because of the stigma. “Many things have changed since then. We have drugs that can bring down viral loads. But awareness among youth remains low,” said Dr Solomon, who heads YRG Care, an NGO. Studies in many countries have shown that teens are more likely to have unplanned pregnancies and contract sexually transmitted diseases. “We have already delayed introduction of sex education in schools,” she said. Many schools in countries like the US, Australia and France promote frank discussions with teenage students on anatomy, puberty, pregnancy and the risks of unprotected sex. The idea is to tell students to wait till they are old enough to experiment. In India, generally parents and teachers are shy to discuss such topics with children. Dr Solomon said that often when she interacts with schoolchildren, their teachers leave the room. She has been conducting such awareness programmes in schools. “Most of the children hadn’t seen a condom. I tell them all about it and also how to use it. I am not encouraging them to have sex. In fact, I tell them to delay or abstain. If they don’t listen to what I say, they will at least know to be safe,” she said. Sex education is a prickly subject despite Unicef spelling out the course module. Dr Solomon said the decline in prevalence of the viral infection had slackened international funding and the National AIDS Control Organization’s programmes. Many NGOs have developed helplines and web-based services as cost-effective ways to reach out to adolescents. “But we need to shed inhibitions and be open to strengthen our battle against HIV/AIDS,” said Dr Solomon."

19,1,2012,Experts ask Centre to increase funding for HIV/AIDS research,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Experts-ask-Centre-to-increase-funding-for-HIV/AIDS-research/articleshow/11584398.cms,"CHENNAI: Scientists working in the field of HIV/AIDS research have asked the Central government to increase funding. The funding and the number of research papers coming out in international journals is largely insufficient and disappointing given the number of people suffering from the viral infection, they said. On Saturday, at the international symposium on HIV and Infectious diseases organized by the YRG Care here, experts said there was a need for youngsters to get into basic and applied research in HIV/AIDS. ""It's been 25 years since we first diagnosed HIV in this country. But the number of research papers that have come out of our country is abysmally low,"" said Dr Suniti Solomon, who diagnosed the first HIV/AIDS case in the country. Results of a global clinical trial showed that treating HIV-infected individuals with antiretrovirals - the drug of choice for people with HIV/AIDS - can reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to the uninfected partner by 96%. ""India was a part of this trial. But we should have ideally been a forerunner. In most couples, only one is HIV positive. They always ask if they can have healthy babies without the virus being transmitted to the non-infected person,"" Dr Solomon said. India has been a part of some global research like that of vaccines. So far, India has worked on at least vaccine candidates for HIV/AIDS. The National AIDS Research Institute and the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis have been involved in clinical trails and some private centres have been working on gels that can prevent transmission. ""But the number of international papers coming out of India is less than most developing countries,"" said Dr VD Ramanathan of the National Institute for Tuberculosis Research, who is part of the AIDS vaccine trial. Most researchers said that international funding for HIV/AIDS has declined as the prevalence rate has also relatively dropped. ""It is important to ensure that we stay on a par with global research. That way we will also be able to find solutions for problems specific to our region,"" said Rajat Goyal of International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. "
20,1,2012,Gurgaon administration fails to find home for HIV-positive kids,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Gurgaon-administration-fails-to-find-home-for-HIV-positive-kids/articleshow/11610600.cms," NEW DELHI:There is no relief for the 13 HIV positive children, including seven girls, rescued last week from Gurgaon after allegations of sexual abuse were made against the owner of the NGO that was sheltering them. The Gurgaon administration has not been able to find a permanent shelter for these children, even as the south Delhi NGO they were shifted to has expressed inability to provide them with permanent accommodation. The NGO says there is not enough space and infrastructure to take them in. The children are aged between six and 12 years, and some of them need special care as they are traumatized, said sources. Anjali Gopalan, director of NAZ foundation— a home for HIV positive children in the capital—said they have two separate dormitories for boys and girls that can accommodate up to 25 children. “Of these, 24 beds are full. The rescued children are being kept in the room reserved for providing urgent medical aid to patients. There is lack of space, few toilets and scarcity of water among other things,” she said. The NGO director said the Gurgaon administration had requested them to accommodate the children for two days, so that they could find a suitable shelter. “Now, they are not ready to take responsibility. There has been no word from the Gurgaon administration,” Gopalan claimed. P C Meena, deputy commissioner, Gurgaon, told TOI that they are trying to arrange a permanent shelter for the children at the earliest. “In Haryana, there are no government-run homes for HIV positive children. We have requested several NGOs in Delhi and neighbouring areas like Meerut to take them in. We hope to zero in on an accommodation by Tuesday,” he said. The HIV positive children were rescued from a Gurgaonbased NGO, Drone Foundation, last week after a raid by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). The manager of the NGO had been accused of sexually abusing the children. He was arrested by the local police on Thursday. Raaj Mangal Prasad, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee in the capital, said the rescued children need medical assistance. “We are in touch with the NAZ foundation and trying to see how we can shift them to a permanent accommodation,” said Prasad."

They will be adopted by different families over the next three to four months. It will kick off on Republic Day, according to SA Ramdas, district in-charge and medical education minister. At a two-day state seminar on ‘Missing Girls and Women: Issues and Implications’ at Rani Bahadur Institute here on Monday, Ramdas expressed concern about the rise in cases of HIV among children. He said: “On January 26, all the HIV-affected children in the district will be adopted by different families. We’ll do our best to help these children,” said Ramdas. The families have the option to either adopt the kids and take them into their home or sponsor them. The modalities are still being worked out. Ramdas said several families have come forward to adopt these orphaned HIV-affected children. In Karnataka, there are 14,800 HIV+ children registered with civil hospitals, added Ramdas. There are 33.2 million people affected with HIV in the world, with 27 lakh people affected by HIV in India. Among them, 13 lakh are children. “We need to come up with a proper solution to this problem. We decided to start a rehabilitation centre exclusively for HIV positive children where they will receive food, accommodation, medicine and education free of cost. The centre will be run by the government in association with NGOs,” Ramdas said. “We’ll take the help of actors to create awareness about HIV and make a movie about HIV shortly,” he said. In the keynote address, C Manjula, chairperson, Karnataka State Commission for Women, said: ‘The commission has received nearly 1,500 cases. In 2010-11, 506 women went missing in Mysore district alone. This is a very serious issue. Universities should do research on related subjects and come up with solutions. We have given this responsibility to the women’s university to study women’s issues and problems in North Karnataka, where more people are migrating to other states. In Bagalkot, there are 15,000 HIV-affected persons.” She called upon seminar participants come up with suggestions which will be conveyed to the government for further study.” The seminar is being conducted by Centre for the study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy, Manasagangotri, University of Mysore, in association with Karnataka State Commission for Women.

Public health experts say the coming together of the two dreaded infections is worrying. Fourteen XXDR TB cases have been detected in the state so far. State government officials and the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) are tight-lipped about the co-infection case. A source said: “The patient is yet to be started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. Such patients are usually treated for TB at the beginning. Once they stabilize, ART is started.” TB is the commonest HIV-related opportunistic infection. An expert summed up the deadly nature of the combined infection saying that when HIV brings down immunity, TB catches up. “The two need to be dealt with in a synchronized manner. Efforts and the machinery to integrate the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) with the HIV programme need to be strengthened.” As per norm, patients received by registered TB centres are counselled to go for HIV testing and vice versa. Since HIV testing is voluntary, many give it a miss. Doctors say TB patients are often not counselled enough to understand the importance of HIV testing. According to data compiled by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), out of 1.01 lakh registered TB patients, only 40,202, or 39%, were referred to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) for HIV testing in 2011 till September. Among them, 1,678 patients tested positive for HIV. In Mumbai, the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is 7-8%. Dr S S Kudalkar of MDACS said mortality among patients suffering from both infections has halved in recent years. “Till a few years ago, the mortality rate (among HIV-TB co-infection patients) was around 8%. Now it is 4%.” He said HIV patients with TB “probably have a higher risk of recurrence and death”. “At no point can these patients afford to discontinue their treatments as that could give rise to (drug) resistance.” A chest specialist said HIV clubbed with resistant TB may be tricky, but not impossible to manage. “Yes, drug interactions (in such a patient) can have more side effects, but it can be handled if the patient comes in at an early stage.” "

With one XXDR (extra extensively drug resistant) TB patient testing positive for HIV, health officials thought it logical to club the information system for both infections. Dr S S Kudalkar, project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said, “The helpline will be later extended even to malaria. People will get information right from symptoms to treatment to testing centres.” The MDACS is in talks with the World Health Organization (WHO) to prepare a module for helpline counsellors. Their training is likely to start in February. The helpline would be opened for TB queries in March. MDACS’s additional project director Dr Harish Pathak said Saadhan gets an average of 30 calls per day and about 120 calls on disease campaign days. “Presently, the helpline is used just 30-40% of its capacity. So we thought of utilizing it for TB as well.” Once the helpline starts, judging by its response, the National AIDS Control Organization (Naco) can be requested to increase the existing strength of four counsellors, Pathak said. “The helpline will also counsel patients about the importance of going for TB testing if they test positive for HIV and vice versa.” "
25,1,2012,"Misconceptions mar fight against HIV, say experts",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Misconceptions-mar-fight-against-HIV-say-experts/articleshow/11669629.cms,"CHENNAI: Twenty-five years after the first case of HIV/AIDS was reported in the country, experts say the main target in the fight against the disease is misconceptions. After releasing the 13th Behaviour Surveillance Survey Round XIII for 2011, experts in the field said that awareness among the public had gone up but awareness without misconception was low. Many believe that healthy-looking people have a good immune system and may not test positive for HIV/AIDS. Doctors have been trying to tell people that antiretroviral drugs — the medicines of choice for HIV/AIDS — will only keep the viral load low, but many assume they are safe after taking them. “We require schemes to target misconceptions. Only awareness without misconceptions will strengthen the fight against HIV,” said AIDS Prevention And Control (APAC) project director Dr Bimal Charles. Dr Charles said that in the surveys, people had said cleaning the vagina with vinegar or having sex with monkeys would keep out the infection. The annual survey report, by APAC project along with Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and USAID, has been prepared since 1996. The survey is conducted among high-risk groups like female sex workers, gays and injecting drug users and bridge population groups such as truckers and migrant workers. With a sample size of 5,000, the field work was done in November and December 2011 across 15 towns in Tamil Nadu. The results showed a significant improvement in the behaviour among targeted groups where NGOs were working. Most field workers had reasons to smile: condom use among female sex workers had gone up from 95.7% to 98.5%; 96.1% of gays reported using condoms during sex with commercial partners, 91% of gays reported taking HIV test in the last one year; the proportion of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) who reported sharing needles and syringes with their partners reduced from 43.3% in the last round of BSS to 31.6% in the current round; and a lesser number of truckers (28.5%) reported seeking services of commercial sex workers when compared to earlier survey (45.1%). But there is still a need for improvement. For instance, though condom use is high among casual and regular clients, it remains low among regular partners; many counselling services aren’t adequately used; and the changing patterns of sex workers have excluded some women from the intervention programmes.

Then a second and third opinion reversed her fears and Dhanalakshmi complained to the consumer court. Now, she has been awarded. 1 lakh compensation by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC ). It started when Dhanalakshmi approached Dr (Mrs ) Agnes of J A Laboratory in Palayamkottai for infertility treatment as she had not been able to conceive after many years of marriage. As part of the routine procedure, she gaveher bloodsamplesfor testing but received a report on June 25, 2003 that she was HIVpositive. The results caused a lot of turbulence in her family. Dhanalakshmi said she was “insulted, humiliated, harassed by all and subjected to untold mentalcruelty."" Assuming that the first test results might have been wrong, she underwent tests at Lakshmi Hospital and Arathy Diagnostic Centre in Tirunelveli on October 1 and November 13 respectively. Both institutions gave clear reports saying she was not infected withHIV-AIDS. She approachedthedistrict consumer forum which ruled in her favour and directed that she be paid a compensation of. 5 lakh and. 5,000 towards costs. Aggrieved by the order, Dr Agnes appealed to SCDRC contending thatthetest results couldbedeemedconclusiveonly after confirmatory tests were conducted. She said she had told Dhanalakshmi to comebackin 15daysbutthelatter did not show up. Dr Agnes added that the test result was the product of a modern automated system in which samples were fed and results delivered after analysis through a computerized process. Passing orders on the matter, a bench of A K Annamalai, presiding judicial member, and S Sambandam, member, observedtherewere no records to show Dhanalakshmi had been asked to come back 15 days after the first test result. Ruling that there was negligence and deficiency of serviceon partof Dr Agnesby disclosing the test results without any confirmation or affirmative tests of a serious infectious disease, the bench ordered that Dhanalakshmi was liable to be paid compensation of Rs 1 lakh.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority has asked all life and general insurance companies to put in place an underwriting policy on health insurance for people suffering from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. This is for the first time Irda has issued guidelines on covering this segment. The guideline will be effective from October 2012. In India nearly 5.7 million people are infected with HIV virus. In a exposure draft issued today, the regulator said that policy should indicate the eligibility criteria. The regulator said that underwriting policy would address persons who are not yet showing AIDS symptoms but are in stage 1 or 2 of HIV infection. The regulations should comply with the treatment protocols of the medication following a very strict timeline. The policy should provide clear guidelines on risks that would be denied. In addition, insurers will have to provide details of loadings at different stages of disease. For insurers are not allowed to reject claims for those who are HIV negative at beginning and subsequently found to be HIV positive. On renewal, insurers can load it accordingly. Insurers can state HIV or AIDS as critical illness, providing as a rider with a lump sum on becoming HIV positive, cover AIDS death as an insured even under health insurance policy and cover them under group schemes to cater to various segments of population. Companies have to provide comments in 30 days. Only one insurance company- Chennai-based Star Health and Allied Insurance Company has a policy under group Insurance cover for the HIV positive patients. "

The incident came to light after Valli (42), (name changed), the boy's mother went to the drop-in centre run by Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) to seek help from B V Babu, president of the Madurai Network of Positive People. Speaking to TOI, Valli (42), who is also an HIV+ said, ""I fell sick about two years ago and blood reports revealed that I tested positive for the deadly virus. I have been on medication ever since,"" she said. Surprisingly, her husband Kaliappan, a tricycle puller, elder daughter Easwari (18) and youngest son Parameswaran (10) have tested negative. Valli said that she never underwent any major blood transfusion or surgery and has no clue as to how she contracted the virus. Valli said she had borrowed Rs 30,000 from a local papad manufacturer to meet the cost of her treatment two years ago. ""Today, this amount has increased to Rs 1 lakh. The only way I will be able to clear my debt is when my sons finish their education and get good jobs. But now, my elder son's future hangs in balance,"" she said. Her brother, who had promised to get his son married to her eldest daughter, has now changed his mind, on coming to know of his sister's HIV status. ""I fear that my children may not be able to lead a normal life because of my disease. All I want is the society to treat them as equals,"" she said. Her son Kathir (name changed) used to fall sick frequently and a blood test done last year had revealed that he was HIV positive. But he was not put on the ART drug as his CD4 count was 475 and the drug is given to patients only when their CD4 dips below 350, said Babu. Kathir looks puny and thin compared to his younger brother who also studies in the same school. ""We were asked to pay Rs eight each for a blood test to identify our blood groups for the ID card. The teacher asked me if I was under treatment for any specific disease and asked me to bring my booklet,"" he said. Babu says that this is a clear violation of human rights. ""I think the laboratory, which tested the boys may have suspected something and asked the school to verify details,"" he said. The boy said that the teacher started discriminating against him soon after perusing the tiny notebook which contained details about his treatment. Meanwhile, the boy's younger brother also stayed away from school as one of the teachers had allegedly told him to ensure that his brother did not come to school from Monday onwards. ""My brother had been sitting alone in one corner of the classroom and the boys in my class are asking me why,"" he said. When The Times of India contacted the district elementary education officer M K T Subhashini, she said that the issue had been taken up with the school's administration. However, the school authorities had denied the allegations and had told her that he did not attend school as he was sick."

They were demanding a white paper on the pact and wide consultation with stakeholders before implementation. The rally with protesters carrying giant inflated medicine pills was held from Mandi House to Parliament Street around 10 am. The support group for people with HIV AIDS, including the Delhi Network of Positive People and Médecins Sans Frontières — an international, independent organization for medical humanitarian aid — claimed that certain clauses in the deal like ‘intellectual property enhancements’ and ‘data exclusivity’ could effectively block the production of generic drugs by Indian companies. “Millions of patients in poor countries, many in Africa, are unable to pay sky-high Western prices to treat illnesses that include HIV, malaria, asthma and cancer. For HIV alone, India makes more than 80% of the world’s medicines,” said Leena Menghaney from MSF. She said that two broad provisions in the agreement — one on intellectual property rights and the other on investor lawsuits — would make it much easier for international pharmaceutical giants to sue the Indian government, drug manufacturers and distributors. It will curtail production of many lifesaving drugs, or cause prices to increase to levels many cannot afford, said Menghaney. Kavaljit Singh, director, Madhyam said due to competition among generics producers in India, the price of first-line HIV medicines has dropped by more than 99%, from US$10,000 per person per year in 2000 to roughly $150 presently. “This significant price decrease has supported the massive expansion of HIV treatment worldwide: more than 80% of the HIV medicines used to treat 6.6 million people in developing countries come from Indian producers, and 90% of pediatric HIV medicines are Indian-produced. MSF and other treatment providers also use Indian generic medicines to treat other diseases and conditions,” he said. The activists demanded that the government make the details of the agreement being discussed public and hold wide consultations before giving any final approval to the same. “Public view must be considered,” said Biraj Patnaik, principal adviser to the commissioners of the Supreme Court on the Right to Food."
31,2,2012,Protein that can knock out HIV identified: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Protein-that-can-knock-out-HIV-identified-Study/articleshow/11881716.cms,"WASHINGTON: In a pioneering research, scientists claim to have identified a protein that can knock out HIV, which causes AIDS, by starving it of raw materials it needs to reproduce . An international team, led by the NYU Langone Medical Center, says its research has in fact revealed a mechanism by which the immune system tries to halt spread of HIV, and harnessing this mechanism may pave the way for therapeutic research aimed at slowing the virus' progression to AIDS. “A lot of research on viruses , especially HIV, is aimed at trying to understand what the body’s mechanisms of resistance are and then to understand how the virus has gotten around these mechanisms,” said team member Nathaniel R Landau in the ‘Nature Immunology’ journal. The research focused on a protein called SAMHD1. Recent studies have found that immune cells, called dendritic cells, containing the protein are resistant to infection by HIV. But it was not clear till now how it works to protect these cells. Now, Landau and his colleagues are able to provide an answer: When a virus, like HIV, infects a cell, it hijacks the cell’s molecular material to replicate. That molecular material is in the form of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), which are the building blocks for DNA. Once the virus replicates, the resulting DNA molecule contains all the genes of the virus and instructs the cell to make more virus. The team found that SAMHD1 protects the cell from viruses by destroying the pool of dNTPs, leaving the virus without any building blocks to make its genetic information. "

Her four-month-old son in tow, Shaik Haseena pleaded with SHRC authorities for relief saying that after she had tested positive, her husband Nisar Ahmed, a labourer, had abandoned her and the child. Based on her petition, SHRC has asked Ratna Kishore, principal secretary of the medical and heath department and Uma Maheshwar Rao, secretary to the State Red Cross Society, to file reports. Haseena’s family had been instructed by staff at a private hospital in Nellore to arrange for three units of blood which her husband procured from the Red Cross Society. The delivery had to be done via Caesarean section and the blood was requisitioned since Haseena was anaemic. She was discharged a week later with mild fever. When the fever refused to subside even 15 days after she had returned home, her family members took her to the hospital where she underwent tests. The results revealed that she was HIV positive but since blood tests prior to the delivery showed her as HIV negative, doctors said that she might have got infected through the transfusion at the time of delivery. When family members approached the Red Cross Society, officials there denied having sold any blood to them. “She fed the child for 10 days. Tests are being conducted regularly on her son to know whether he, too, has been infected,” said a relative of Haseena. Although the blood bank was sealed after the incident came to light, Haseena’s travails are far from over. The tiffin centre her mother used to run has gone out of business since customers started staying away after the news of her being HIV positive became public, the relative said. Family members said that despite several requests to Nellore district collector D Sridhar, who is also the chairman of the Red Cross Blood Bank, no financial assistance has been extended nor any treatment arranged for Haseena whose health is deteriorating. However, a plot for a house and provision for the supply of 35 kilos of rice have been made. The SHRC order, issued on Saturday, states that a committee constituted to inquire into the incident has not submitted its report to the collector. The SHRC has now directed the district collector to furnish a copy of the report filed by the committee. "

The woman said she had married Sunil Kumar in March 2006 before he went to study in Bathinda, where he fell in love with a classmate. The classmate asked Kumar to divorce his wife as she learnt that he was married. But when his wife refused to divorce him, Kumar and his paramour stole a sample of HIV-infected blood from a laboratory and injected it while administering her saline. The complainant said she noticed the saline was red in colour and pointed it out to her husband. But Kumar told her that it was mixed with some anti-biotic. The woman complained after she was diagnosed with HIV. She was referred to PGI Chandigarh for treatment. On the basis of the probe carried out by doctors, a case has been registered against Kumar and his paramour. Abohar SP Varinder Singh Brar said a team has been constituted to nab the accused, who are on the run. "

This is for the first time when the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) has been providing relevant information to the newly recruited constables about HIV/AIDS and about their role in preventing the infection from spreading further. A police official involved in providing training to constables said, ""They will undergo a 36-week training. From this year, we have been providing complete information to them on HIV/AIDS during their training period."" He informed that the training directorate has issued a letter to all the police training schools to hold separate classes for constables on HIV/AIDS. The RSACS trainers hold classes of constables in police training schools in the state and so far they have trained 1,400 new recruits. ""We are sensitizing them and informing them about misconceptions. But, most importantly, we make them learn about the role of the police in mainstreaming the people living with HIV/AIDS,"" a trainer said. Medical, health and family welfare director (AIDS) J P Dhamija said, ""We should prevent new infections of HIV/AIDS. With the same objective, we are spreading awareness among people and police department is one of them."" He said the personnel are being informed about the groups - migrants, injecting drug users and sex workers - vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infections,. Earlier, the medical department also provided training in batches to police officials but now they have started full-fledged classes in police training schools. Since a lot of migrants come to Rajasthan because of the presence of mines and industries, areas where the migration is high are always on the risk of HIV/AIDS infection. ""Police have to play crucial role in such areas to spread awareness about the infection,"" a department official added."

The preliminary data of the 2011 study jointly undertaken by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) has revealed that the state witnessed a sharp decline in HIV prevalence among the high risk groups. If the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 11% in 2008, it has dropped to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%. Officials said that the substantial drop in HIV prevalence among female sex workers, which was very high in AP, was an achievement. The state has 1.56 lakh sex workers. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation alone has 22,000 female sex workers and 4,000 MSMs. Apsacs officials said that the condom usage has increased considerably resulting in the decline of HIV infections. Kailash Aditya, joint director (targeted interventions) said that the health seeking behaviour among the high risk groups has gone up which was earlier not the case. ""This is a very positive sign,"" said Aditya. Officials noted that about two to three years ago, there was a huge scale up of the fatal disease in the state. AP figured among the top five states with highest incidents of HIV. Apsacs subsequently stepped up its interventions going till the grass root level to deal with the high risk groups. Currently, there are 169 targeted interventions in the state. Of these, 23 targeted interventions are being directly implemented by the Community Based Organisations (CBOs). Because of the ownership of the CBOs, the HIV/AIDS prevention services reach a large number of community members, officials said. However, of the 22,000 female sex workers in GHMC jurisdiction, Apsacs has access to just about 16,000 sex workers indicating that better surveillance is required. As far as the state is concerned, the total number of people living with HIV/AIDS is estimated to be over 5 lakh. Of these, 3.75 lakh are registered with Apsacs. "

Delivering a lecture, “Science protects humanity: Adventures in infection and immunity” at IISc, Doherty said millions have been invested into HIV/AIDS research but there’s still no vaccine. “What we can definitely say is that vaccine research has been enormously revitalized __ it’s not just the money, but we have a better understanding of the immune system. Having said that, we are still some distance away from vaccines for particular infectious diseases.” Doherty said hope lies in a better understanding of certain viruses. “That’s why we were we able to stop SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in time. It infected 8,000 people and around 10% of them died…” To that extent we have made an advance in science and understanding of medicine. Science is protecting us.”"

For more than three months, patients are struggling without treatment as the first line of therapy is not effective to keep the viral load under control. The problem has compounded for patients as the JJ Hospital’s Centre of Excellence remains one of the nodal centres in the state to screen and select patients for second line of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Patients who become resistant to the first line of ART treatment, and have a viral load of more than 5,000 copies per millilitre, have to be started on the second line. Patients are also dependant on the free second line ART treatment as it could cost about Rs 10,000 in a month. A medical source told TOI said the problems started soon after former ART in-charge Dr Alaka Deshpande quit in November 2011. “Monthly meetings, which were held to select patients after their viral load examinations were done, just stopped. Without those meetings the patients could not be selected,” said a JJ Hospital source. Dr BB Rewari, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) ART consultant, said, “There was no new doctor trained to replace the previous nodal person. The new team headed by Dr V K Joglekar has requested us to sensitize them about the ART. We will be doing that soon.” he said. Rewari also said that not more than 100 patients would be affected because of the delay. “Two centres in Aurangabad and Pune have commenced operations to take the load off the JJ Hospital staff. Nagpur will also have another centre soon for second line therapy,” he said. However, some doctors at JJ Hospital defended themselves by saying that lack of training alone should not be blamed for the delay. “The testing facility to check viral load had stopped, however tests have resumed,” said one of the doctors. Sources told TOI that medical kits required for testing viral load were out of stock, and so the laboratory at Kasturba Hospital could not carry out the tests. Red Ribbon train at CST for 2 days Red Ribbon, an AIDS/HIV awareness train, will be parked at CST on Wednesday and Thursday. The train, flagged off in the second week of January from Delhi, is covering 23 states. The six-coach train has several interactive ways to spread awareness, counsel patients and even training facilities. A separate coach has exhibits on tuberculosis, malaria, reproductive and child health. "
40,3,2012,"In India, two out five female sex workers suffering from HIV",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/In-India-two-out-five-female-sex-workers-suffering-from-HIV/articleshow/12271596.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly two out of every five female sex workers (FSWs) in India could be suffering from HIV infection. Those who aren’t already infected, however, carry more than 50-times increased risk of getting infected during their lifetime. The region where the risk of HIV infection increased most for a sex worker was Asia (29 times more) compared to a 12-time higher threat in Africa and Latin America. A study, conducted by Dr Stefan Baral from the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health, to be published by the Lancet on Thursday shows that FSWs in developing countries are 14 times more likely to be infected by HIV than women in the general population. The authors carried out an analysis of 102 studies, representing almost 100,000 FSWs in 50 countries. Overall, HIV prevalence in FSWs was found to be 12%. In 26 countries deemed to have medium or high background HIV prevalence, some 31% of FSWs were HIV- positive, and were 12 times more likely to be infected than women from the general population. “We identified consistent evidence of substantially higher levels of HIV among FSWs compared with all women of reproductive age in low and middle-income countries in all regions with data,” the authors said. “These findings suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV-prevention programming and services among FSWs because of their heightened burden of disease and likelihood of onward transmission through high numbers of sexual partners as clients. Improvement of linkages to antiretroviral treatment and retention in care is crucial. The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,” they added. “When reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India. Since HIV prevalence is a lagging indicator of prevention success, time is needed to reveal the benefit of these programmes in terms of the absolute burden of HIV among female sex workers in India. Nonetheless, the disproportionate burden of HIV among these sex workers, even in settings where progressive programmes exist, emphasizes the need to increase coverage by increasing scale of prevention programmes and decreasing barriers to access,” is how The Lancet summed about the situation in India. In India, women account for around one million out of 2.5 million estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS. The National Aids Control Organization estimates that around 4.9% of FSWs in India are HIV- positive. The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50% over the past decade. India had about 1.2 lakh new HIV infections in 2009 as against 2.7 lakh in 2000. While this trend is evident in most states, some low prevalence states have shown an increase in the number of new infections over the past two years. Of the 1.2 lakh estimated new infections in 2009, the six high-prevalence states account for only 39% of the cases, while states like Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat account for 41% of new infections. The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2000 through 0.36% in 2006 to 0.31% in 2009. In India, about 40% people don’t even know their HIV status. The prevalence of HIV among key population at higher risk of infection – notably sex workers, people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men – is high in several Asian countries. However, the virus is spreading to other sections of the population through the years. "

43,3,2012,HIV+ but positive on having a child,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/HIV-but-positive-on-having-a-child/articleshow/12336873.cms," With the basics against HIV/AIDS – early diagnosis and continued treatment - seemingly in place, Indian doctors are looking at sociological nuances associated with the condition. An ongoing study at JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department, for instance, is looking at fertility and reproductive desires of HIV-positive people. “We are studying if men and women who have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS understand the emotional, social and financial implications of having a child,” said Dr Rekha Daver, who heads the gynaecology department. The fiveyear-long study, which is being done jointly with the Indian Council for Medical Research, started last year. The idea is to develop a better counselling mechanism for HIV-positive people. Incidentally, the National AIDS Control Organisation has recognised JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department as a Centre of Excellence in the Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV/AIDS programme. “We have delivered 1,073 HIVpositive women in the last 11 years. We have also managed to control mother-to-child transmission of HIV to a great deal. In fact, of the last 100 deliveries, 95 children are free of the virus,’’ said Dr Daver. Considering the number of HIVpositive people who come to JJ Hospital, it’s not surprising that the fertility desire study is being done here. “The study involves hours of intense counselling, taking down notes and a check-up . We have finished interviewing around 20 people so far,’’ said Dr Daver. She added patients usually say having a child is their ultimate dream. “Social pressure as well as the woman’s own mental makeup contributes to this decision,” said Dr Daver. Every pregnant woman who comes to JJ Hospital’s gynaecology department is counselled and voluntarily tested for HIV. They are informed of the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and possibility of the children becoming AIDS orphans. “But many still want their biological babies,” she said. A Harvard University study a few years back noted that “spousal, family, community and cultural influences greatly shape HIV-positive women’s desire to become pregnant. Studies in India , South Africa, Taiwan and Vietnam have demonstrated the weight of culture-specific spousal and family wishes that a woman will need to consider besides her own desires and HIV status.” Dr Daver added many HIV-positive women opt for pregnancy as they are worried about discrimination in society if they are childless. “HIV-positive women have as much social problems as medical issues,’’ she said.

Led by city Congress president Jaswantsinh Bhatti, Congress workers stormed the blood bank and smashed its glasses. Police had to be called in to bring the situation under control. Several Congress workers including Rajesh Chawda, Jalpesh Vaghela, Pravin Vadher, Rakesh Makwana, Ajit Luhar, Mavji Rakhshiya and Mukesh Parmar were arrested for vendalizing the blood bank. Later, Congress spokesperson Aziz Ibrahim said that the victim, a child from a Dalit family suffering from thalassemia, had been undergoing blood transfusion at regular interval at the voluntary blood bank for the past two years. “His poor parents had to shell out Rs 800 or more each time for the transfusion. Recently, the child health condition deteriorated and he was admitted to Rajkot Civil Hospital where he was diagnosed as HIV positive. When his family approached police commissioner, police and blood bank conducted HIV test on his mother which came negative. When senior officials from the state health department came for inspection, they were given five-star treatment and the matter was eventually swept under the rug,” said Ibrahim. The Congress leaders said that they are determined to take the issue to its logical conclusion and will continue to agitate till the justice is done."
45,3,2012,Woman gives supari for killing HIV+ve lover,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Woman-gives-supari-for-killing-HIVve-lover/articleshow/12349620.cms,"NAGPUR: She wanted to get rid of the man diagnosed as HIV-positive as he was pestering her for sexual favours. The woman was afraid of being infected with the disease. Shunned by his wife, the man was desperate for sexual relief from his lover with whom he was in relationship for around three years. The mistress roped in three young neighbours with a promise to pay Rs 70,000 to eliminate the man for ever. Deepak Purke, an attendant with the Bank of Maharashtra branch in Ayodhya Nagar, was taken to a desolate place near Paunapur in the outskirts of the city on February 13 last month before being stabbed to death. The joint effort of the special squad of assistant commissioner of police RS Pawade and Kalamna police saw the case being cracked with the help of the call details records. Four people, including the mastermind Anita Chaudhari, have been arrested on Tuesday. Along with Anita, the police have also arrested two brothers Tejram and Mukesh Moundekar, and Kishore Katwe, all in their 20s, for the murder. The alleged assailants are residents of Lalganj. Head constable Sanjay Wankhede, Anil Karne and Sanjay Bangarkar of the special squad picked up the assailants. Police said that Purke, father of two, entered into a relationship with Anita, a mother of three, even while he was having an affair with another woman. Anita's husband had passed away around five years ago. Purke did not have a cordial relation with his family members and often stayed out. He also stayed with Anita on a number of occasions at her place. Police said that Anita was given a lot of money by Purke. She had also kept his bike. Soon, however, there was a breakdown in the relationship. Learning about Purke's relationship with Anita, his family member thrashed her. She reported the matter to the police and got Purke's parents and siblings booked for attempt to murder in 2010. Police said Purke's health became the prime issue of discord between Anita and him. She contacted Kishore and sought his help in eliminating Purke. Kishore roped in Tejram and Mukesh. She even brought them to Shantinagar where Purke resided so that they could identity their victim. It was the call details of the bank that gave police the first clue. Four suspicious mobile phone numbers cropped up before the police. Anita had initially said that she had only one SIM card. But police soon found out that she was possessing more than one. PI Rajesh Padvi of Kalamna police station said one SIM was used to coordinate murder plot. Anita had also given a cellphone to Mukesh to coordinate the actions. On the day of murder, Anita invited Purke to take his bike. Kishore took Purke as pillion and drove towards Kalamna after they met near Harihar temple. Mukesh and Tejram followed them on another bike. They convinced Purke that the bike was kept in a field near Paunapur where on reaching he was stabbed to death. Police said that Mukesh was traced with the help of his girlfriend with whom he had being communicating regularly and had also gone for an outing the day after the murder. Anita apparently had paid only Rs 35,000 till date. Police have recovered the bike of the victim and other evidences. Assailants wanted money for sisters' marriage Two of the four assailants, arrested for Pradeep Purke's murder, agreed to do the job as they wanted money for their sisters' wedding slated for later this year. Tejram and Mukesh Moundekar, who were apparently given Rs 12,000 each for the murder, were roped in by Kishore Katwe. They even spent the money on wedding-related expenses. "

47,3,2012,Medical expenses impoverishing families with HIV+ members: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Medical-expenses-impoverishing-families-with-HIV-members-Study/articleshow/12408660.cms,"PUNE: The medical expenses incurred by families who have at least one HIV positive member are a serious strain on their finances, pushing many of them into a “poverty trap”. This was revealed in a field survey of 401 such families in the city, undertaken by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) to gauge the economic profile of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level. The families surveyed are registered with a city NGO, which works towards providing socio-psycho, legal support and counselling to PLHIV. Though the study included households from all strata of society, and from varied economic backgrounds, nearly 50% of the sample group was from the lower economic categories. The study was completed under the guidance of Sanjeevanee Mulay, former associate professor at GIPE. Varun Sharma, who undertook the study, is a former senior research fellow at GIPE and currently assistant professor at the Institute of Health Management Research (IHMR) in Bangalore. He said the study was an attempt to estimate the relationship between HIV prevalence and poverty. “We cannot overlook the fact that PLHIV from the lower socio-economic background, especially from the slum areas in cities like Pune, are most vulnerable. This should be considered while drafting policies and programmes concerning HIV,” he said. Sharma said the study used economic methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Standard of Living Index (SLI). Based on these two indices, the study found that families with HIV+ persons are more destitute compared to other families. “This is especially true of households run by HIV+ women. The study revealed that 70% of the sample households managed by women have a middle socio-economic status whereas about 50% of them can be categorised as the ‘poorest of the poor’. In comparison, only 30% of households run by men fit in the category. The reason for this may be that, in general, a woman’s income is less than that of a man,” he said. The study revealed that though anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for treating HIV is free at the public health centres, HIV+ people have to spend from their own pockets on other illnesses and ailments which come with the HIV infection, Sharma said. “The economic burden is more on those who are already poor, and it leads to medical poverty trap. In the analysis, we found that there is a sharp increase of 20% BPL headcounts, when adjusted for out-of-pocket health spending,” he said. HIV+ people from the upper and middle socio-economic backgrounds usually opt for private health facilities, which are better, and also because it offers them a privacy. Sharma said a comparison between the families surveyed and the city’s non-HIV urban households (surveyed under the national reproductive and child health programme) confirmed that a majority of PLHIV households either came from the lower economic strata of society or had gradually become impoverished over a period of time. According to the study, 36.9% households with HIV+ members had a low standard of living. Sanjeevani Kulkarni, coordinator, Prayas Health Group, which treats more than 3,500 HIV/AIDS patients from the city and other parts of the country at its clinic, said special focus on widowed women diagnosed with HIV is needed. “Around 33% of the total population of HIV infected women belongs to this category. Implementation of policies that address the needs of such sections of society is imperative,” she said. "

57,4,2012,Strict law covering HIV-infected people against discrimination soon,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Strict-law-covering-HIV-infected-people-against-discrimination-soon/articleshow/12576160.cms," NEW DELHI: A person whose spoken or written word(s) that may lead to hostility or hatred against an HIV patient could go to jail for two years. An AIDS patient cannot be denied employment or sacked except with a written assessment of an independent healthcare provider that the person poses a risk of transmission of virus to others at the workplace. These are some of the path-breaking provisions in a law drafted by the government that provides for stiff punishment for discrimination against those who are HIV-positive and for propagating hatred against the victims of the infection. The ‘new deal’ for a stigmatized group that is often condemned twice is in the final stage of approval with the Centre finalizing the long-pending HIV-AIDS (Prevention &amp; Control) Bill that was caught in differences between ministries of law and health. It lays down inviolable rights for patients and stringent duties for individuals and institutions dealing with them. HIV test not must for getting jobs, proposes bill The proposed law states that testing for AIDS cannot be a pre-requisite for employment or for access to healthcare, education or public places. It would mean that HIV afflicted people refused entry to public places like hotels or restaurants or denied purchase or renting of house can move an ombudsman. They can also move courts against discrimination. Also, a person with HIV virus cannot be sacked or denied employment except with a written assessment of a qualified and independent healthcare provider that the afflicted person indeed poses risks of transmission. Any person below 18 years of age and a woman of any age will have the right to live in a shared property, as a safeguard against eviction due to stigma. The medical costs will be factored in during any maintenance settlements. This can help women in divorce cases. The law would put in place a National Authority in the form of a Department of AIDS Control (NACO), which will formulate guidelines and rules for protocols like treatment of HIV patients through Anti-Retroviral Therapy or rules for blood banks or diagnostic centres. An ombudsman in every state, as the forum to adjudicate violations under the law, would help the aggrieved to avoid time-consuming legal proceedings in civil courts. The law seeks to deter rampant victimization of HIV-positive persons. A key clause prescribes a jail term of three months to two years for any spoken or written word, or display of information or advertisement, which could expose HIV-positive persons to any form of hostility. This can also lead to a fine up to Rs one lakh. The inviolable right of an HIV person, as part of the first-ever codification of rights and duties, may help patients who face subtle or overt discrimination with no forum for grievance redressal. The law asserts no person can be forced to take an HIV test. For such a test, the authority would have to secure consent after due counseling on all pros and cons. Similarly, no HIV-positive person can be subjected to medical treatment without his consent – a decision which should be made after he has been informed about the risks and benefits of the treatment. A judicial order would be the only exception to force an AIDS test on a person apart from “screening purpose” in a blood bank. The HIV positive persons would finally enjoy guaranteed confidentiality. No person can be compelled to disclose his HIV status (except under a court directive). In a strict deterrent, the law states that if a person reveals the identity of an HIV-positive, as information that is passed on as part of legal proceedings, he could face a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh. To balance the threat of transmission with stringent non-disclosure law, a doctor can disclose his patient’s HIV-positive status to his partner if he believes there is a risk of infection. However, he would have to guard against such disclosure about a woman if there is apprehension that it can lead to her being abandoned or facing violence. The ombudsman can impose an initial fine of Rs 10,000, and thereafter Rs 5,000 a day for non-compliance of orders. To ensure that non-discrimination clause of Act is followed at workplace, every institution with over 100 employees would have to appoint a senior officer to deal with violations of the law."

The men had allegedly said that they would not allow the body to be buried unless his relatives settled the amount immediately. The deceased, Gnana Arockiam (38) was working as a load man at Malaithathampatti in Manapparai and had contracted the HIV virus six years ago. Father of two children, Arockiam was undergoing treatment at the Trichy Government Hospital. When his wife came to know that her husband had contracted HIV, she left for her ancestral home at Pothamettupetti along with their children. Meanwhile, loneliness coupled with the presence of the disease made Arockiam's life miserable and he attempted suicide on Wednesday by jumping into a well in Malaithathampatti. On getting information, the Manapparai station fire officer rushed to the well and saved Arockiam. He was admitted to the Trichy GH but breathed his last on Wednesday night. Arockiam's parents, Savarimuthu and Chellapappa and other family members, including his sisters and wife took his body to Malaithathampatti burial ground to perform the last rites. Suddenly, a few loan sharks came to the scene and demanded money that they claimed they had loaned to Arockiam. They said they would not let the family members carry out the last rites unless someone repaid the debt. The family in a fit of despair and frustration left the body at the entrance of the burial ground and left. The news of a dead body lying unattended was brought to the notice of the local police and inspector of Vaiyampatti police station, who summoned the family members of the deceased. They later made arrangements for the burial under police protection around noon on Thursday. ""We have not received any complaint from any one about Arockiam's indebtedness,"" police said."
60,4,2012,Stem cells can be tweaked to hunt & kill HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Stem-cells-can-be-tweaked-to-hunt-kill-HIV/articleshow/12658906.cms," WASHINGTON: In a major breakthrough in the fight against AIDS, scientists claim to have for the first time shown that human stem cells can be genetically engineered to seek out and kill HIV-infected cells in a living organism. The study demonstrates for the first time that engineering stem cells to form immune cells that target HIV is effective in suppressing the virus in living tissues in an animal model, said lead scientist Scott G Kitchen. He added: “We believe that this study lays the groundwork for the potential use of this type of an approach in combating HIV infection in infected individuals , in hopes of eradicating the virus from the body.” In their previous research, the scientists took CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes — the “killer” T cells that help fight infection — from an HIV-infected individual and identified the molecule known as the T cell receptor, which guides T cell in recognizing and killing HIV-infected cells. In their latest research, the scientists at California University similarly engineered human blood stem cells and found that they can form mature T cells that can attack HIV in tissues where the virus resides and replicates. They did so by using a surrogate model, the humanized mouse, in which HIV infection closely resembles the disease and its progression in humans . In a series of tests on the mice’s peripheral blood, plasma and organs conducted two weeks and six weeks after introducing the engineered cells, the scientists found that the number of CD4 “helper” T cells — which become depleted as a result of HIV infection — increased, while levels of HIV in the blood decreased. CD4 cells are white blood cells that are an important component of immune system , helping to fight off infections . These results indicated that the engineered cells were capable of developing and migrating to the organs to fight infection there, the ‘PLoS Pathogens’ journal reported. “We believe that this is the first step in developing a more aggressive approach in correcting the defects in the human T cell responses that allow HIV to persist in infected people,” Kitchen said.

There is need for greater awareness so that people don't shy away from owning up a HIV+ kin,"" said hospital's deputy medical superintendent Dr S N Swain. Family sources said the woman after her delivery in Banapur hospital in November was referred to Khurda district headquarters hospital because of profuse bleeding. There she was transfused with two units of blood, which may be the source of her infection. ""We have raised the issue with the Khurda hospital authorities,"" said Pravasini Pradhan, president of Kalinga Network of Positive People, which works for the welfare of HIV+ persons. Volunteers working for HIV+ said the development is not very unusual as several women if tested positive were facing similar ostracism. ""In this case since the husband is negative and wife positive, the man has tried to escape the situation by shrinking his responsibilities,"" said Ambika Parida, a women's rights educator with Property Ownership and Legal Literacy (POLL), a project working for HIV+ people."

We dig deeper... Case 1: On Friday, 38-year-old Kumar (name changed), jumped into a well at his Ajni home in the wee hours. His body was recovered hours later with his cellphone and a suicide note lying close to the well, which said, 'Nobody's to be blamed for my suicide."" Case 2: 23-year-old tattoo artist Veer (name changed) recently discovered that he was suffering from AIDS. Unable to cope with his rapidly falling health, the lad just stopped taking medicines and finally committed suicide a few days back. Along with being HIV positive, these two men had another thing in common - both of them were closet gays and hadn't declared their sexuality to their families. So, what needs to be done to contain these suicides in the gay community? We try to find the answers… Sex education must Film director Onir of films like I AM and My Brother Nikhil fame, who's openly declared his sexuality, says: ""It's the burden of dealing with the dual stigma (of homosexuality and HIV), which proves to be their undoing. Gays won't reveal their sexuality without fear till the time Supreme Court gives a ruling in their favour. Meanwhile, sex education will go a long way in educating them about safe sex. Parents' support can safeguard them against societal cruelty and mockery, which eggs them on to take the ultimate step. They must not force their kids to get married against their wish. It is enough that their child is happy with a partner of his own choice. This acceptance can lessen such sad incidents!"" Need Support group According to Prince Manvendra Singh, India’s first gay royal to declare his sexuality, being a part of a support group goes a long way in lessening the psychological burden of HIV-inflicted gays. ""If they interact regularly with like-minded people and share their fears, their goals and their woes with other HIV-positive people, they feel much better and stronger from within. But, if they remain closet gays, nobody can help them. There's nobody to hold their hand and wipe their tears when danger signals appear,"" says he. Speak about it! Anand Chandrani, the founder president of an NGO dedicated to gays and transgenders, says, ""Kumar couldn't cope up with the fact that he was leading dual life. And when he learnt that he was HIV positive, he just couldn't bear the pressure of multiple trauma. There are many others in our community, who need slightest trigger to commit suicide. It can help a great deal if they speak about their HIV status to their families at least, because they need extra care and nourishment and family support is most vital!"" Diary of an HIV Positive gay ‘I tried to commit suicide thrice’ Sundar (name changed), 25 ""Two years back, I learnt that I was HIV positive, and tried to commit suicide thrice since then. But, whenever I went to jump into a well, the faces of my parents would come in front of me, and I would step back. My parents are now pressurising me to get married, and I am scared of telling them about my homosexuality, as I’m already trying to cope with my HIV."" ‘My mom’s support helps me’ Tarun (name changed), 23 ""I have known for the past four years that I'm HIV positive.

""I have lived my life. But my child is about to bloom. After all relatives having washed their hands of her care, I don't know how she will live and who will power her dreams and shape her future."" The state of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) is growing grim, with more than 400 such children waiting for someone to make their lives a bit easier. Ragini is passionate about dancing and whenever the song 'Ata jau dya na ghari' is played, her legs just begin to tap and she loses herself in the music. ""I go to school at Nashik Road. I don't remember my mother, who died when I was one. My father died when I was nine. I know I have the disease, but also know that I can fight it,"" said Ragini. Similar is the fate of 12-year-old visually impaired CLHA, Ankush, who lives in a slum in Satpur. Ankush loves to play the keyboard and other instruments. He lost his father three years back to AIDS and his mother Sangeeta, also HIV positive, is terminally ill. Sangeeta hopes that the government will raise some shelter system for such children. ""Having acquired AIDS from their spouse, women are the worst hit. They lose their husband, their own life and also are unable to see their kids living happily. At least if there is an arrangement for the well-being of the kids, we can be at peace,"" Sangeeta said. The government, on its own part, cannot allow any such facility, as this would mean discriminating against the ill-fated children, who are the victims in this whole vicious circle. ""The government has no scheme to promote a separate facility for HIV positive persons as it would amount to discrimination,"" said a senior official from the health department, adding that instead, the government was ready to fund all the medical aid required by the patients. But such means are found insufficient when it comes to the lives of CLHA, once their parents or grandparents pass away. Mahindra and Mahindra along with Yash Foundation has started an HIV/AIDS awareness programme and is working on the rehabilitation of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and support to CLHAs. ""For the last three years, we have been providing nutritional support to more than 150 CLHAs, monitoring their health and even giving them medical support whenever required. But unfortunately, we do not have a residential system for the children,"" said Jitendra Patil, rehabilitation manager, Yash Foundation. This is the time when the need of such arrangement is required the most. In the field of medical inventions, medicos have found solutions such that even HIV-positive parents can give birth to a normal child. ""The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) could serve the purpose by raising an 'educational hostel' facility for the short span of twenty years from today. Here, even normal children could also be admitted. The children could go home during the weekends,"" Patil suggested. Exhibition with a cause Mahindra and Mahindra, along with Yash Foundation is trying to raise funds to help reach more number of CLHAs in the district. In one such drive, they had organized a 'Taarein Zameen Par' programme on January 26, where renowned artists Shivaji Tupe, Anand Sonar and Dnyanesh Belekar from Nashik, with students from the Arts stream created a large number of paintings, which have now been put for auction from April 30 to May 2 at Sadhana Art Gallery, Deepali Nagar, from 11am to 8pm. ""We aim to raise funds for the CLHAs in such a way that we reach the most number of CLHAs in the district,"" Patil said. (Some names have been changed on request)"

Kantha, her HIV-positive husband Radhakrishnan and her two daughters spend the evenings in the dark in their newly built house on Periyar Street, Indira Nagar in Thirumani village in Chengalpet. ""My children are scared at night without power,"" Kantha said. She applied for electricity connection on January 25. She paid around Rs 3,000 for various charges including a caution deposit for the electricity meter. She got a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the gram panchayat in January. When executive engineer (Chengelpet division) A R Mascurnas held a grievance meeting on April 4, hers was among the 17 cases listed as top priority. But, nothing has happened. Kantha and her husband Radhakrishnan, have been targets of social discrimination for the past few years when Radhakrishan set up an office in Chengelpet for persons affected with HIV in Kancheepuram district. In less than a year, the couple had to shift at least five rented premises after house owners found they are HIV positive. Finally when they decided to build a house on a government allotted plot of six cents, a group of residents set fire to the half-built structure in January 2011. That threw them out on the street, again. Not giving up, they saved and borrowed from a few friends and relatives to build the house for which they are begging for an electricity connection. TNEB officials said the connection could not be given because of shortage of manpower and equipment. ""Recently we got approval for electricity poles to give 17 new connections, but are yet to get them. Once we get the materials, power connections will be given,"" said Baskar, junior engineer of TNEB Chengelpet division.

The rise in condom usage has brought down the HIV prevalence in the state significantly among its high risk group population. The 7.5 crore free condoms that were supplied for the high risk groups got exhausted much before the end of the year and the state had to request the Tamil Nadu government to donate their leftover 60 lakh condoms in March. Seeing the massive response, the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has added to AP’s quota of condoms and will now ship 10.9 crore condoms this year. The authorities are attributing the substantial drop in the HIV prevalence rate to the increased condom usage. As per the survey conducted by AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) and Naco, that is being finalized, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers has dropped from 11% in 2008 to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%. The sexually transmitted infections too have seen a drastic drop. Officials say that till about four years ago, the situation was so dismal that lakhs of condoms were wasted, having crossed their expiry dates because of no takers. But today, Apsacs is struggling to ensure that shortages don’t crop up. “People have become more health conscious now and they are also seeking the services of the integrated counseling and testing centres. This is a healthy trend,” says T Kailashditya, joint director, targeting interventions, Apsacs. He added that Uttar Pradesh tops the country in condom usage and is followed by West Bengal, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Apsacs has been selling condoms at a subsidized rate to several sections such as truckers. Last year, 1.5 crore condoms were marketed like this for this population apart from the 7.5 crore free condoms doled out to the high risk groups. “The situation is such that we have to plan a month in advance for the supply to avoid a shortage,” said the official. Besides, condoms are being lapped up over the counters by the general population. Experts said that factors such as education, benefits of condom use and perceived infection risk are also playing an important role. They added that after five years of effort, the demand for condoms has gone up and the HIV prevalence rate has shown a decline. However, the state still has the highest number of people (5 lakh) living with HIV/AIDS in the country. "

However, we have received the kits now and have started supplying them. The screening will resume soon,"" said Asha Hegde, joint director (basic services) Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). Every month, the state requires 2.32 lakh screening kits for its 578 centres, of which 42 are located in Pune district.

Officials at the Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTC) at Sassoon hospital and Yashwantrao Chavan hospital in Pimpri also confirmed the shortage. ""There are three tests that need to be performed on blood samples to check for antibodies against the HIV antigen. The first test is most important as it picks up positivity of the virus and is extremely sensitive. Kits for this test are in short supply while those for the second and third tests are available,"" said an ICTC official. Most people reporting for voluntary HIV testing have been instructed to come after May 15 but we have not received testing kits till date, said another ICTC official.

In a rare surgery, a team of gastroenterologists, using laparoscopic technology, replaced the HIV-positive man’s damaged food pipe with a fold of his stomach. Doctors generally hesitate before performing any kind of complicated surgeries on HIV positive or clinical AIDS patients because their immune systems are usually highly compromised. “It’s risky. If the vein near the food pipe gets damaged, it’s almost instant death. This new tube itself may develop a leak, which could lead to death. They are highly prone to infections and the patient finds it difficult to recover post-surgery,” said Dr J S Rajkumar of Lifeline. The operating team also puts themselves under risk when using the laparoscopic machine on a HIV-positive person. “We have a separate ward for them. The instruments can never be reused and the blood touching the skin or the sharp instruments poking us could be very dangerous,” he added. The procedure was done by making three holes on the side of the chest, four holes in the abdomen and a cut in the neck. “We inserted the thoracolaparascopic equipment inside, removed the damaged esophagus, and then separated the layers of the stomach, and pulled out a part of it, to make a tube out of it, and tied it up at the neck,” said Dr Rajkumar. Ravirajan was diagnosed with HIV in 2000. Five years ago, his food pipe almost closed. He could not take solid food. “My throat would get blocked even if I had porridge. Then I would vomit it out,” said Ravirajan. His food pipe kept narrowing and had to be dilated. After nearly 22 such dilations, Ravirajan lost all hope of eating. And then he walked into the hospital for the surgery in April. "

Speaking as chief guest on the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial observation here on Sunday, he lauded the role played by HIV positive people and drug users in leading the struggle for protection of rights and decreasing the spread of the HIV epidemic. Manipur is one of the six states in the country with widespread prevalence of HIV/AIDS. According to the Manipur Aids Control Society (MACS), the state has 38,573 HIV positive people and 698 have died of the disease till March 2011. Till May 2001, 19,455 people have registered for Anti Retroviral Therapy. Drawing the attention of the MACS project director to the unfinished task of revising the state AIDS policy, legislator I Ibohanbi Singh said policies are a must for tackling issues like HIV and AIDS. ""The draft state AIDS policy needs to be tabled at the earliest and discussed threadbare so that our response to the epidemic is in tune with the needs of the community. We need commitment and the gap between NGOs implementing HIV-related programmes and MACS has to be bridged so that the need of vulnerable communities are addressed,"" he said. MACS project director Sailesh Kumar Chourasia said the event, based on the theme 'Promoting Health and Dignity Together', gave the people an opportunity to look at what they have achieved so far and, more importantly, chart out a future course of action to sustain the effort. Different departments need to come together if we want to respond to the epidemic in a holistic manner, he said. Sixteen civil society organizations, human rights groups, lawyers, drug users, nupi manbi (transgenders) and positive networks and NGOs in the state joined the observation. The memorial function kicked off on Saturday with a painting competition for children affected by HIV and AIDS.

The woman told the chief judicial magistrate, Imphal West, that she was forced to marry a man who hid his HIV status and now, she was a victim of the disease. She also charged him and his in-laws with torture. Human rights lawyer Rakesh Meihoubam said this is the first of its kind in Manipur and second in the country. In Delhi, a woman filed a criminal case against her husband for transmitting HIV without her knowledge, but the case didn’t move forward as the husband died of AIDS. Till March 2011, 698 people have died of HIV/AIDS in Manipur. "
76,5,2012,They took on HIV and won,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/They-took-on-HIV-and-won/articleshow/13427622.cms,"BANGALORE: It’s a day of hope for these 17-year-olds. Many memories are bitter, after being shunned by the society for a long time. Their future looks bright, after tasting their first success, sweeter because they’ve fought the dreaded HIV. It’s been a lonely fight, with hardly any family support and campuses unaware of their disease and only an NGO to keep up their morale. This result season, TOI is showcasing not only toppers but also students who may not have scored extraordinary marks but deserve their place in the sun. This group is one such, making education inclusive in its truest sense. Like Jacob who secured 83.5%. An adopted child, he ran away from home after his stepmother’s death because people around him had no empathy for him. He’s a Kannada-medium student and stammers when he speaks in English. Ask him to speak in Kannada , and he insists: “No, I want to speak in English to learn the language.” He adds: “I’ve suffered a lot, that’s why I have the urge to do better. I want to write the civil service exam one day and come up with policies that’ll help HIV-positive people,” he said. Jacob recalls how his teachers didn’t allow him to go on tours and how his plates and tumbler were kept aside separately after he was confirmed positive. For Bhagyashree, the challenges are different . She’s not HIV positive, but her mother and elder sister are and her mother almost drags herself to work to feed her three children . “My other family members don’t even know about the disease,” said Bhagyashree who scored 297 marks. Bhagyashree is focused on getting a good job to “provide nutritious food for my mom and sister”. She said, “My mom does all the household work so that we have enough time to study. When she sacrifices so much for me, can’t think of anything else but study hard,” she said. Gayathri, who failed to clear one paper , put up a brave front. Having lost her parents to the disease when she was a toddler, Gayathri, the family’s sole breadwinner, stays with her grandmother. When she was in school, she teach Kannada to three batches of children every day from 3pm to 9.30pm. Then she started working for a BPO and now works for a legal outsourcing company . “I get up at 2.30am and my shift is from 3am to 9am. I go to college by 10.30am and classes end 3pm. I get back home and try to catch up on sleep. But mostly there’s homework and lots to learn,” she said. She added: “I like science. But it’s a costly course and requires a lot of time too.” She plans to do BCom and LLB. But the bitterness rankles. Gayathri says: “Some people ask us: ‘Why do you need to study, you’ll anyway die tomorrow?’.” "

In a unique initiative, the state government has proposed monthly financial assistance of Rs 1,000 for patients suffering from the disease. While orphaned children infected with HIV/AIDS will get Rs 2,050 per month, other children will get Rs 1,750 per month. The budget has earmarked an initial corpus of Rs 5 crore for the ambitious health scheme. This scheme was among the key highlights of Delhi government’s budget for 2012-13 in the health sector, for which Rs 2,124 crore (14.16% of the total outlay) has been allocated. State health minister AK Walia told TOI that more than 300 beneficiaries have already been identified for the issuance of the assistance money. “There are about 10,000 HIV/ AIDS patients registered with us for anti-retroviral treatment. These patients need extra nutrition and balanced diet to cope with their compromised immune system. The financial aid is aimed at helping such patients,” said Walia. In a relief for thalassaemia patients, the government will introduce VAT exemption on ‘blood bags’ (lucocite filters), which will reduce the cost of blood storage and transfusion. Expansion of the ambulance fleet, increasing the number of dialysis machines at hospitals and improving the infrastructure at Delhi State Cancer Institute were among other highlights. However, the budget proposals for the health sector, pertaining to development of health infrastructure, can largely be described as old wine in new bottle. It proposes to increase the number of hospital beds per thousand population in the capital from 2.55 to 3. For this, the government has said new hospitals will be constructed at Burari, Ambedkar Nagar, Hastsal and Sarita Vihar, among other places – most of these projects were mentioned in last year’s budget also.

79,6,2012,Lohardaga Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre detects more HIV cases,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/Lohardaga-Integrated-Counselling-and-Testing-Centre-detects-more-HIV-cases/articleshow/14034936.cms," LOHARDAGA: There has been a rise in the number of HIV positive case in Lohardaga district in recent times. This has come to light with the proper functioning of government's HIV test centre in the district. Although the rise in number of HIV cases is a matter of concern for the common man, the district health department is looking at it in a positive manner. ""This will not only help the HIV positive person to avail better and free treatment but also stop transmission of HIV to others,"" said an official. In last two years the official figure of HIV positive cases was put at 22. Till 2010, eleven persons, including pregnant women and children, were found to be HIV positive in the tests conducted at the government's Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) run by State AIDS Control Society. Year-wise detection of HIV positive cases in the district for last three years on an average stands at five. The ICTC was opened in Lohardaga in 2008. Only one one HIV positive case was detected that year. Later detection of HIV positive cases increased. While in 2009 three such cases were detected. The number increased to seven in 2010, five were detected in 2011 and sixes cases have been detected so far in 2012, thereby, taking the total number since 2008 to 22. ICTC counsellor Archna Prasad, however, is not satisfied with the number of detection of HIV positive cases in the district. According to Prasad, many more persons suffer the disease but hesitate to come to the ICTC located at the Lohardaga Sadar Hospital for tests and counseling. ""Since my centre maintains everything one needs, trust is necessary. Although people are coming for HIV tests, we still have miles to go with regard to bringing about awareness among the people and removing reservation of those affected by HIV but keeping away from the ICTC. Migration is the source of the disease and this is a major problem as it is difficult to counsel, conduct tests and offer treatment to the affected persons who live outside the state. At most times we ask relatives to encourage their family members to go for testing at their nearest ICTC where they live,"" Prasad said. The absence of anti retro-viral therapy (ART) centre in the district is creating a problem. A 32-year-old woman found with HIV positive recently has still not started medication as she cannot travel alone. ""She is waiting for her husband, who works in Mumbai, to return. He, too, will have to undergo HIV test,"" a source said."

The meagre Rs 200 pension, promised by the government two years ago, remains a dream for the HIV-positive patients. With a view to providing economic support to the HIV-positive patients, the government had decided to provide Rs 200 every month on a par with the physically handicapped, widows and destitutes, but the proposal remained only on paper. Konda Lakshmi (name changed) rued the lack of financial support from the government as well as her family. “We are left to fend for ourselves. A small gesture could have gone a long way in helping us financially,” she pointed out. Another proposal to provide free bus passes to HIV patients to visit anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres every month to take medicines and undergo treatment free of cost has also been a non-starter. “Patients can at least visit the ART centre to take medicines if they are provided free bus passes,” Lakshmi said. Several HIV patients alleged that the government had washed its hands of by merely issuing ATM cards to them. “Though the cards were issued three months back, not a single penny has been transferred to our savings accounts so far,” complained another patient Sunnam Gangadhar (name changed). He also criticised the government for selecting a meagre number of patients for the pension scheme when thousands of people were afflicted with the disease in Nizamabad district. According to statistics, there are about 12,000 registered HIV-positive patients in the district. But the district authorities have selected only 1,250 patients for the Rs-200 pension scheme. As per the health guidelines, patients whose CD4 count is less than 250 and those who take medicines from the ART centres are eligible for the pension scheme. When contacted, district medical and health officer (DM&amp;HO) Harinath said that there was delay in transferring the amounts to the savings accounts of the patients. S Siddaiah, who runs an NGO, demanded that the government provide essential commodities like rice, pulses, oil, sugar and others free of cost to the HIV patients. Recalling that HIV-positive patients were supplied 30 kg rice at Rs 2 a kg every month by issuing Anthyodaya card in 2009-10, he urged the government to take measures to protect the HIV patients."

The government has already earmarked Rs 1crore for research on AIDS. The Central Food Technologies Research Institute has come forward to provide nutritious food for needy HIV infected children. We are working that out.'' The documentary, by Maya Jaideep and Vasuki KG, is based on research done by the community on a joint project by Mysore-based Ashodaya Samiti and Manitoba University in Canada, and deals with lives of male sex workers in Mysore, Belgaum and Bellary districts. It documents their conflict and celebrations, including their fight against stigma and discrimination.. Earlier, chief minister DV Sadananda Gowda said the number of AIDS patients in the state has declined from 1.5% to 0.7%, and there is a need for more sexual awareness in the state."

The children they’ve met in the city have surprised the American students with their knowledge of English and their perceptiveness, say the volunteers, who are here on a summer programme under the auspices of the International Alliance for Prevention of AIDS (IAPA). Student volunteer Max Silva, a senior in anthropology at University of Arizona, said he signed on for the programme because he wanted to do something different and help the HIV community. “At first I thought it would be tough to teach children in Chennai and that language would be a barrier,” said Silva, one of the 19 American student-volunteers in the city this year. “But, man, we are having a blast! The kids here are fluent in English and ask you some very pertinent questions,” he added. School students, for their part, have reacted enthusiastically to the workshops held by the volunteers. “We became aware of unprotected sex and the danger of AIDS,” said Ramesh, a Class 9 student at a school in the city. “It was not a subject that we could discuss at home or with our teachers.” Arulraj Louis, IAPA education director, says the American students have helped the group reach out to school children and educate them on how to prevent the spread of AIDS. “They will be with us till the end of July,” he said. He said IAPA’s aim was to spread updated, accurate, fact-based HIV/AIDS information to schools and community groups. “Our focus in the volunteer programme is to provide a rewarding and enjoyable experience for American and Indian students that will encourage involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” Louis said. Every year, IAPA conducts a Summer Volunteer Programme (SVP) to teach school and university students in Chennai the scientific facts of HIV/AIDS, IAPA field officer Sheema Gopi said. “We enroll volunteers from the University of Arizona and Arizona State University and train them for six months before they come to Chennai,” she added Gopi said the American students stay in Chennai for two months during which they conduct, along with trained Indian volunteers, HIV/AIDS workshops for school students. “We taught more than 6,000 students about HIV/AIDS in schools and universities in Chennai in 2011,” she said.

83,6,2012,Resource centre for women with HIV opened,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Resource-centre-for-women-with-HIV-opened/articleshow/14158484.cms," NAGPUR: The twelfth five year plan may have special support for the HIV-positive women and children. Women living with HIV/AIDS may also get priority at government shelter homes. This is among the measures being proposed by women and child development (WCD) department of the government of India. Vandana Jena, adviser to the WCD in planning commission shared this information after a formal launch of country's second Women Resource Centre (WRC) in city at India Peace Centre. The centre has been set up with the help of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). First WRC was set up at Ajmer. Jena said that every district may have one such shelter home. Women with no shelter like destitute women, Dalit women, and widows can seek shelter here through a national helpline to be created for the purpose. Priority will also be given to HIV-positive women in these homes. In fact, government is also contemplating support for 'women in conflict areas' like those affected by left extremists. WRCs are aimed at linking all the different government welfare schemes to the women and children living with HIV/AIDS. The Positive Women Network (PWN), an NGO working for HIV-positive women in country in 13 states at present, is the force behind the centre. The funds for the centre come from UNDP. These women generally become widows at a very early age. Since they are afraid of disclosing their HIV status openly, they cannot avail the benefits of various social welfare projects and schemes. WRC will work for bringing these schemes to the positive women by helping them with documentation and follow up procedures to get the benefits faster. Umesh Chawla from UNDP said that problems of women living with HIV/AIDS were compounding. WRC would act as a link between the social protection schemes of the government and affected women. Akhila Sivadas from the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) lauded the efforts of the pioneer of such women's cause, P Kousalya, president of PWN which has helped about 28,000 women so for in various ways. She said that Kousalya is the living testimony of the struggle such women undergo. ""The dynamics of government working do not allow people to champion the cause of such women. But Kousalya has proved it otherwise with her dedication, sincerity and above all her daring to face the highest officials in planning commission and seek intervention for PWN members,"" she said. She also lauded Cyantha Shinde for taking over the responsibility as WRC coordinator for the city. Dr Ravi Wankhede, director of Jeevan Jyoti Blood Bank, Dr Milind Bhrushandi, Dr Praveen Dahake and Smita Pawanikar, district women and child welfare officer, were also present. Defying adversity, helping a cause Nagpur: Disregarding the consequences, she went ahead and declared in public her HIV-positive status way back in 1995. In fact, she was the first HIV-positive woman to admit her status before the media. P Kousalya, now president of the Positive Women Network (PWN), became a widow at the age of 19 after just seven months of marriage. Instead of losing heart, she championed the cause of women like her. Kousalya shared her journey from her initial plight of not getting the right treatment and drugs to her present achievement of seeing her dream of starting Women Resource Centres (WRCs) for women and children living with HIV/AIDS with TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the centre in city. ""My mother had decided to marry me to my husband when both of us were child. He was a truck driver and knew he was infected with HIV just a few days before our marriage. He did not share it with me and passed the infection to me. Although I studied till Standard XII, I didn't know anything about the disease. I even went to quacks,"" said Kousalya describing her journey from Namakkal, a town in Tamil Nadu infamous for high HIV/AIDS prevalence. Looking back, she says she realized what good her family did to her and society at large by letting her share her HIV status. It was a blessing in disguise for women like me. ""Now I can stand face to face with authorities and demand our rights. Initially, I had to face a lot of hardship as I was thrown out of such platforms. But now I am a part of not just national but also international forums working for the cause. Yet we still have a long way to go,"" she said."

The advocate and parents of some of 23 thalassaemic kids, who were found infected with HIV due to transfusion of contaminated blood, had sought a thorough probe. The HC asked the then ASP Junagadh, Shobha Bhutada, to investigate. But the court was not satisfied with her efforts. Last month, the court issued a show-cause notice to the government on transferring the case to the CBI. On Friday, government pleader Prakash Jani vehemently opposed the proposal highlighting how the central agency was short of strength. The senior counsel also supplied papers showing history of CBI probes across the country, ostensibly demonstrating that the agency had miserably failed and faced criticism. He reiterated that the court should give a chance to the state agency to probe the case. On the other hand, petitioners' lawyer Girish Das contended that an opportunity was given to the state police, but it had failed to deliver."

National AIDS control organization (NACO) has given its consent as it believes that the truckers from all the three adjoining states have their transit here. Talking about the recent approval by the NACO, Dr Vanita Gupta, project director State Aids Control Society (SACS) said, ""Earlier this group of high risk in the city was refused as it was not included in the long distance driving. However, it has been now included in the NACO's mapping. They were convinced that all these migrants coming from Himachal, Punjab and Haryana halt in the city."" As per the latest data on the Aids by the SACS, there were 68 cases in the city in 2010 which shot up to 93 last year. There are 12 target intervention groups which are high risk for HIV. ""In the migrants category we had labourers only. But from next month we will start headcount of truck drivers who can be at risk. This particular group has been recognized as the most vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases all across the country,"" said Dr Gupta. There has bee no survey till now on the truck drivers. ""Transport chowk area is the hub of such migrants who commute on regular basis to the adjoining states. This migrant category needs sensitization which can now be possible,"" said Sandeep Mittal, who will manage this project. For the overall reduction in the epidemic, targeted interventions are aimed to effect behaviour change through raising awareness among the high risk groups. It has been researched that truckers are a critical group. Their living and working conditions, sexually active age and separation from regular partners for extended periods of time predispose them to paid sex or sex with non-regular partners. ""These interventions build awareness among the spouses of truckers and migrant workers, women aged 15 to 49 and children affected by HIV or vulnerable population groups,"" said Dr Gupta. "

The hospital later retracted their report and apologized to the patient after his fresh test turned out to be negative. A complaint was registered with the health department on Monday to investigate the matter and take action against the hospital authorities.

Doctors suggested for detailed investigations including and HIV test. The report was positive. Narrating his plight, Sharma told TOI, ""In was shocked to see the positive HIV report and could not face family members and friends. I was subjected to medication for nearly three months.

CBI probe has been ordered for the first time by the HC while acting on a PIL. When the kids were found infected with HIV last year, parents and lawyers from the HC filed PIL demanding a thorough probe. The state government did not even register an FIR against erring officials. The court asked IPS officer Shobha Bhutada to probe the case, but the judges expressed disappointment at her efforts. Transferring the probe to the CBI, the bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattachayra and Justice J B Pardiwala criticized Bhutada's probe and highlighted her inaction and blunders in its judgment. The judges were shocked at Bhutada's recording statement of local BJP MLA Mahendra Mashroo on the letterhead of a private blood bank, Sarvodaya Blood Bank, which faces charge of being criminally negligent in blood transfusion. Emphasizing on inaction on part of the IPS officer, the court noted that allegations were against high level officers and the legislator, who illegally occupied space in the government hospital and he being chairman of the blood bank invaded into government's official site and all top officials were blissfully ignorant about this. The court said that the administration saw to it that probe did not take place in proper manner, as the government was even reluctant to register an FIR. The court observed that no effective steps were taken during five months of probe and the system seemed supporting the private blood bank, which did not even have a license. ""In our view, the present case is an exceptional one where in the history of this country, at no point of time in the past, 23 innocent children have been alleged to be infected with HIV positive for the inaction or negligence on the part of a single government hospital and in such extraordinary circumstances, we are of the opinion, we should transfer the probe to the CBI,"" the court order read. The court said that handing over the probe to an independent agency could instill confidence among people in circumstances, wherein inaction is apparent. The court rejected all contentions raised by the state government. Certain lame arguments were also put forth by the government that the CBI officials might have problem in going through documents in Gujarati. To this, the judges wrote, ""We will definitely pass appropriate order for removing the difficulty in lawful way for the purpose of finding out the real culprit; otherwise, there will be no fair investigation and in future also, other innocent persons will be the victims of negligence."""
89,6,2012,Once-daily Quad pill found to be safer than ART regimens for HIV patients,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Once-daily-Quad-pill-found-to-be-safer-than-ART-regimens-for-HIV-patients/articleshow/14488906.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new once-daily pill combining three antiretrovirals (ARTs) and a booster molecule has been found to be safe and effective alternative to two widely used drug regimens for newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults, who have had no previous treatment. The findings of two large international randomized trials to be published on Friday's Lancet says the new ""Quad"" pill is faster acting, doesn't have the neuropsychiatric side-effects associated with other combinations, and could improve compliance with treatment. Patient adherence to medication is vital, especially for patients with HIV, where missed doses can quickly lead to the virus becoming resistant to medication. Older HIV treatment regimens involve taking several pills multiple times a day. Paul Sax from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, lead author of the first study, said, ""Our results provide an additional highly potent, well-tolerated treatment option and highlight the simplicity of treatment resulting from combining several antiretrovirals in a single pill."" Sax said studies have shown that single pill treatments improve both adherence and patient satisfaction and help prevent prescription errors, helping reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and drug resistance. The first trial randomly assigned 700 patients from centres across North America to start treatment with two different single tablet regimens — either Quad, combining the new integrase inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) boosted with cobicistat (a new pharmacoenhancer COBI) plus FTC/TDF, or a gold standard regimen approved by the FDA in 2006, combining EFV/FTC/TDF (also known as Atripla). After 48 weeks of treatment, 88% of patients given Quad suppressed viral loads to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies per mL of blood), compared with 84% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. Adverse events that led to patients discontinuing treatment were infrequent and similar in both groups. Mild nausea was more common with Quad, but patients were less likely to have dizziness, abnormal dreams, insomnia, and rash compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF regimen. The second trial included 708 treatment-naïve adults from 146 medical centres across Australia, Europe, North America and Thailand. Patients were randomly assigned to receive once-daily Quad or a popular and recommended twice-daily combination of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/RTV) plus FTC/TDF. The primary endpoint, to achieve viral levels below 50 copies per mL of blood by week 48, was reached by 90% of people in the Quad group compared with 87% in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group. The safety of the two regimens was also similar with only 3.7% of patients stopping treatment in the Quad group and 5.1% of patients in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group. If approved by regulatory agencies, the Quad would be the first once-daily single-tablet regimen containing an HIV integrase inhibitor. Administration of multiple pills and management of additional prescriptions increases complexity, costs for patients, and the chances of poor or partial adherence. For regimens of the same efficacy, total pill burden and dosing frequency are some of the most significant obstacles to achieving high adherence. ""The EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen is undergoing regulatory review; if approved, it would provide an important new treatment option as the only once-daily, integrase-inhibitor-based, single-tablet regimen for initial treatment of patients with HIV,"" the study added."
90,6,2012,Once-a-day pill fights HIV better than older drugs,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Once-a-day-pill-fights-HIV-better-than-older-drugs/articleshow/14519660.cms,"New Delhi: A new once-daily pill combining three antiretrovirals (ARTs) and a booster molecule has been found to be safe and effective alternative to two widely used drug regimens for newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults, who have had no previous treatment. The findings of two large international randomized trials to be published on Friday's Lancet says the new ""Quad"" pill is faster acting , doesn't have the neuropsychiatric side-effects associated with other combinations , and could improve compliance with treatment . Patient adherence to medication is vital, especially for patients with HIV, where missed doses can quickly lead to the virus becoming resistant to medication. Older HIV treatment regimens involve taking several pills multiple times a day. Paul Sax from Brigham and Women's Hospital , Harvard Medical School , lead author of the first study , said , ""Our results provide an additional highly potent , welltolerated treatment option and highlight the simplicity of treatment resulting from combining several antiretrovirals in a single pill ."" Sax said studies have shown that single pill treatments improve both adherence and patient satisfaction and help prevent prescription errors, helping reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and drug resistance. The first trial randomly assigned 700 patients from centres across North America to start treatment with two different single tablet regimens - either Quad , combining the new integrase inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) boosted with cobicistat (a new pharmacoenhancer COBI) plus FTC/ TDF, or a gold standard regimen approved by the FDA in 2006, combining EFV/FTC/ TDF (also known as Atripla ). After 48 weeks of treatment, 88% of patients given Quad suppressed viral loads to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies per ml of blood), compared with 84 % in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. "

A conference was arranged in Delhi with a panel of doctors, mostly gynaecologists or oncologists. The vaccination, which protects you from the deadly HPV virus that leads to cancer, was discussed. The initiative is called ‘Guard your Angel’. In this case, the angels are your daughters, who can get immunised after the age of nine. Although the vaccine is most effective on young girls before their ‘sexual debut’, the doctors said it could be effective right until the age of 45. Now that is something most women don’t know. The doctors answered many questions clearing the doubts of about a hundred women in the audience, a largely educated one. I can’t even begin to understand the plight of the uneducated rural women who have no idea about cervical cancer. “Don’t wait for someone to take you to the doctor, whether it is for the vaccination or the yearly screening. Get up and do it yourself,” said the doctors. Statistics show that one out of every four women affected by this kind of cancer is an Indian. It is now a bigger killer than breast cancer. ‘Meri beti meri duty’ said the initiative. However, it is also our duty to live for our betis and our whole family. So while you get your daughter vaccinated after she is nine, also get yourself vaccinated if you fall below the age of 45. “Your family needs you and you have to take care of yourself” said Parminder Saini. She is a pediatrician who got affected by cervical cancer. She fought it and is back to leading the life of a doctor. “I want people not to feel sorry for me but want the affected to be inspired to fight this disease and the rest of the world to keep themselves healthy,” she said. She talked about deleting stress from our lives as much as possible, pointing to the fact that it can be one of the main causes of cancer. Practices like yoga and meditation should be a part of daily life. “Eat healthy, focusing on fruits and vegetables,” she said. “Live your life and value it.” So let’s guard our special angels. Sunil Shetty talked about his angel Atiya and I talked about mine, Tiara. We talked about guarding and protecting them against any danger that may lie in their path. "
92,7,2012,"US upholds privacy, approves HIV test at home",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/US-upholds-privacy-approves-HIV-test-at-home/articleshow/14683283.cms,"NEW DELHI: Now, HIV can be tested in the privacy of your home. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday approved the first over-the-counter HIV test kit that allows people to test at home to see whether they are infected with the virus that causes AIDS. The OraQuick In-Home HIV test is designed to allow individuals to collect an oral fluid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums inside of their mouths, then place that sample into a developer vial and obtain test results within 20-40 minutes. However, a positive result with this test does not mean that an individual is definitely infected with HIV, but rather that additional testing should be done in a medical setting to confirm the result. Similarly, a negative test result does not mean that an individual is definitely not infected with HIV, particularly when exposure may have been within the previous three months. FDA says the test has the potential to identify large numbers of previously undiagnosed HIV infections, especially if used by those unlikely to use standard screening methods. “Knowing your status is an important factor in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV,” said Karen Midthun, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “The availability of a home-use HIV test kit provides another option for individuals to get tested so that they can seek medical care, if appropriate.” However, India is not going to allow home testing of this deadly infection. India’s National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) told TOI that counseling patients before and after they undergo testing is vital. “If patients find themselves HIV positive by testing at home without counseling, it can push them to suffer from severe depression, make them commit suicide or lead to violence if women are found to be positive. Around 35% of all new cases of HIV in India are among women India. Such home testing kits can be allowed in countries with high infection rates in the general population and not in India where the epidemic is concentrated among high risk populations like sex workers,” said national ART officer at NACO Dr B B Rewari. Union health ministry officials said at present nearly 10,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million people got tested for HIV. Around 2.31 million people are estimated to be HIV positive in India. “Of these, 40% don’t know that they are infected. Counseling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus,” Dr Rewari added. Dr Sandhya Kabra from NACO said, whenever a patient is found to be HIV positive, the test is repeated two more times to confirm the results. “If found negative, the test isn’t repeated. But if the test gives a positive result, we repeat the test for extra confirmation. Testing without counseling can make a patient take drastic measures,” Dr Kabra said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 50,000 new HIV infections every year. Many of these new infections are transmitted from people who are unaware of their HIV status. Clinical studies for self-testing have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 92% for test sensitivity, the percentage of results that will be positive when HIV is present. This means that one false negative result would be expected out of every 12 test results in HIV-infected individuals. Clinical studies also have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 99.98% for test specificity, the percentage of results that will be negative when HIV is not present. This means that one false positive would be expected out of every 5,000 test results in uninfected individuals. A variety of home tests finger pricks or mouth swabs are now being developed to be used by individuals to know their HIV status by sitting at home which can produce results in one-20 minutes. A UNAIDS report recently said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is a huge barrier to treatment scale up. “Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,” UNAIDS said. In September, 2011, the United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing. "

Speaking at the inauguration of a literacy campaign, he said the nuclear-family system has contributed to the rise in HIV/AIDS. Living in a joint family eradicates the possibility of having extra-marital affairs. In olden times, elders in joint families would watch over children, teach them to be good, and prevent them from going astray. Nuclear families give way for affairs, Ramdas said without explaining how they promote HIV/AIDS. The Ramayana teaches us to be loyal to our partner, the minister said, and gave Rama’s example. Supporting primary education minister Visveswara Hedge Kageri, Ramdas said: “The concept of saffronization is nothing but teaching intellectual values to children through the Ramayana.” Following the Ramayana is the best way to eradicate social evils; it would help to lead a good family life. Teaching the same in schools would benefit children. Interacting with children, he advised them to become like M Visvesvaraya and increase their intellectual level. “Whoever studies in the English medium is not intelligent; children learning Kannada are not inferior.” “Every day when you step out to go to school, seek blessings from your mother. It will benefit you in a big way,” he told the children. "
94,7,2012,HIV scare in Mumbai as funds dry up,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/HIV-scare-in-Mumbai-as-funds-dry-up/articleshow/14788415.cms,"MUMBAI: An HIV scare looms large over Mumbai as regular supply of condoms, syringes and medicines to tackle the deadly virus has nearly dried up in its most vulnerable pockets. Twenty-one NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and 13 community-based organizations (CBOs) that handle a total of 52 intervention projects for the city’s population at highest risk of contacting and spreading HIV have not received central government funds since April. This blow comes at a time when already close to 60,000 of the 4.20 lakh individuals in the state afflicted with HIV are living in the city. Although its prevalence in the general population has been on a decline, the graph has only been rising for the high-risk groups. The crunch in funds has directly affected efforts made by agencies to protect an estimated 2.34 lakh high-risk individuals. They include female sex workers (FSW), transgender individuals, men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), truckers and migrants. Currently, HIV prevalence among FSW is as high as 27%, 18% in IDUs, 12% in MSM and 30% in the transgender population. Following the fund crisis, most NGOs and CBOs have been forced to downsize their workforce and a few have even completely stalled their work. Funds allocated to each project vary from Rs 9 lakh to 20 lakh, depending on its reach. Without the money, most organizations have been unable to pay their staffers, and have defaulted on the rents and electricity bills. The worst hit are some former sex workers-turned-outreach workers and -peer educators, who have had to go back to their old ways to support their families. TOI came across one such outreach worker from Malwani who said she waited for two months for her salary of Rs 7,000 to arrive. “On the third month, I had no choice but to do the only work I knew,” said the worker, who is associated with a CBO that caters to the transgender population. As an outreach worker, her job is to visit brothels to distribute condoms and inform new entrants about prevention. A Ghatkopar-based NGO told TOI that they were struggling to even purchase stationery for daily use while a south Mumbai CBO that works with MSM said they had to take huge loans to meet ends. Eldred Tellis, director of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, said he had to borrow approximately Rs 7.5 lakh from his trust’s buffer to sustain three IDU projects. “Though bigger NGOs can sustain for a while, smaller organizations are finding it extremely difficult to cope,” he said. Ashok Row Kavi, founder-chairperson of Humsafar Trust, also said three of his MSM projects were badly hit. “Without paying salaries, how can I expect my volunteers to be present at the site and distribute condoms everyday? This (fund crunch) has created a dent in the measures taken so far and an increase in HIV prevalence is likely,” he said. Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said, “The delay was from NACO’s end. But funds have arrived now and we have started disbursing it already.” He also said the crunch at the Centre could be caused by the drying up of money from global agencies. Geneva-based Global Fund (GF) had announced stoppage of funds till 2014 for diseases, including HIV, in India. Dr Neeraj Dhingra, deputy director general, NACO, said he would check how and why the crunch happened. “There is sufficient money to fund projects as long as NGOs are clear with their records,” he said."

The case is likely to move to the special CBI court in Mirzapur on Wednesday. It was for the first time that the HC ordered a CBI probe while acting on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL). Deepak Damor, the superintendent of police from CBI, Gandhinagar, will be investigating the case, sources said. The court had asked Shobha Bhutada, the Junagadh superintendent of police, to probe .

This is because the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has named responsible persons of Sarvodaya blood bank as accused persons in its fresh FIR filed at the instance of Gujarat high court. Mashroo is the chairman of this blood bank, which was being run on the Junagadh government hospital campus without registration. Even the HC raised various questions on the existence of this blood bank in the government premises and criticized former investigating officer — IPS Shobha Bhutada in harsh manner for going soft on the blood bank office bearers in her probe. In its lengthy order, the high court had elaborately recorded how the blood bank illegally was functioning in the government hospital. The court also highlighted the fact that despite not being registered, the blood bank was even listed in state government’s official website. In its FIR submitted to the special court in the city, the CBI has leveled all those charges earlier applied in this case by the Gujarat police against the accused persons — culpable homicide not amount to murder, causing hurt by means of poison and abetment. Other accused persons held by the CBI, though not named any, are the civil surgeon of the government hospital and the pathology department officials. On June 17, the bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala transferred the case to the CBI for further probe. This was despite strong objection from the state government. In transferring the probe, the court said that handing over the probe to an independent agency could instill confidence among people in circumstances, wherein inaction was apparent. Lately, even the CBI starting showing reluctance to take up probe in Gujarat, as in one of such cases the central agency claimed severe shortage of staff and maintained that most of its resources are engaged in the police encounter probes in Gujarat only, and it cannot summon other officials from Delhi. This probe is being supervised by the Gandhinagar-based CBI officer Deepak Damor. "
97,7,2012,HIV-positive mother and son shunned,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/HIV-positive-mother-and-son-shunned/articleshow/14872025.cms," KOLKATA/KHARAGPUR: Little Sanju (name changed) is hungry. He sits on the floor and cries, but his mother can't give him even a biscuit because the kitchen is barred to her. They are pariahs in their own home because they are HIV-positive. Mitali (name changed) and three-and-a-half-year-old Sanju don't have AIDS but the entire village shuns them as untouchables. Wild rumours go around that mosquitoes can bite the mother-son and spread the infection. And this is in Kharagpur, home to one of the premier tech institutes of the country and a three-hour drive from Kolkata. Sanju's father died from AIDS a little over a month ago. He worked as a private security guard at IIT-Kharagpur's Central School. As soon as he died, Mitali's in-laws tried to throw her and little Sanju out of the house, calling her a witch and a husband killer. However, Mitali's mother, who lives nearby, fought back fiercely and forced them to keep the mother-child. Sanju's father started complaining of a debilitating weakness and had constant attacks of cold and cough and stomach ailments in March this year. Gradually he became so weak that he couldn't go to work any longer and spent the day lying in bed. He was initially treated at Kharagpur subdivisional hospital, which sent him to Midnapore Medical College, where he was detected with full blown AIDS. Once they knew he had AIDS, the hospital refused to keep him. Mitali brought him back and he died on June 5. The local doctor then advised her and her two children to go for an HIV screening. Mitali and Sanju tested positive but her elder son, a six-year-old, was clean. Neither the family nor the locality knew the difference between HIV and AIDS and treated Mitali and Sanju like taboo. Mother-in-law Bakulrani was adamant that they would not live under the same roof. She called her daughter and son-in-law from Kolkata and gathered her other sons around her to throw out the mother and child. They tried to force Mitali's mother, Shampa Deb to take her back, but she refused. ""I live with my brother's family. I don't have space to take them back. Why should they be turned out of their own house? They don't have AIDS and even if they did, it is not infectious. What crime have they committed?"" asked Shampa, who often has to send food for Mitali and Sanju lest they go hungry. Shampa first approached local councillor Jaya Pal for help. Pal visited the family and persuaded Bakulrani against turning Mitali out. Kharagpur municipality chairman Jawahar Pal, the councillor's father-in-law, also came to the rescue. ""We found that not only her family but the entire Chatimtala area had turned against the poor woman and her son. The locals feared that her disease was contagious. They complained to me that if mosquitoes bit them and then bit others, the disease would spread. I have tried my best to alleviate such unscientific fears ,"" said Jawahar. The local Chatimtala Club also came around eventually. ""We were a little hesitant at first because we thought that the mother-child could infect others. But we have understood now and will ensure that theyMitali and her son are not turned out,"" said Kartick Kanungo, a club member. But not everyone in the locality is as aware. As Sanju toddled up to a grocery store to buy some lozenges, the shopkeeper shooed him away. ""Stand outside the shop, keep the money there and leave,"" the shopkeeper said, throwing the candies at the boy. ""I think she is a polluted woman who gave her husband and son the disease. She should suffer,"" said a neighbour. The district's chief medical officer (health), Sabitendra Patra, promised regular monitoring of Mitali and her son from Saturday. A medical team will be sent to spread awareness in the neighbourhood. ""We first need to contain the panic in the area. We will educate people so that the mother and son are treated with compassion. We will also take care of their treatment. Since they are HIV-positive, they will have to be under medication throughout their lives,"" said West Midnapore district magistrate Surendra Gupta. The district has 306 HIV-positive patients."

The new centres would come up at Bharatpur, Jhunjhunu, Barmer, Dungarpur, Nagaur and Jalore. The NACO has approved Rs 32 crore for preventing new infections, care support and treatment, institutional strengthening and strategic management information system. Last year too, NACO had approved almost an equal amount for the state. Barmer, Dungarpur, Nagaur and Jalore were identified by the NACO last year for ART centres but due to certain reasons, these centres could not be opened, a health official said. Besides, the Centre has directed the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) that four ART centres from previous years annual action plan need to be made functional. The work for construction of ART centres in the four districts has been completed and they would be opened soon. There are 10 existing ART centres in the state - in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Udaipur, Kota, Ajmer, Alwar, Pali, Bhilwara and Sikar. As per the department's figures, out of the total people living with HIV, who started ART, 12,488 are alive and currently on ART. Jaipur district shows the maximum number of people living with HIV ever started ART with 7,800 patients till March 2012. In Jodhpur, there are 5,579 and in Udaipur 3,930 people living with HIV are on ART. Apart from 10 existing ART centres, there are 26 link ART centres, which are also functional in the state for providing services to people living with HIV."

The drug,'Truvada' can now be used by those at high risk of the infection and anyone who may engage in sexual activity with HIV-infected partners, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced. ""In two large clinical trials, daily use of the drug was shown to significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection,"" it said on Monday. However, some health workers and groups active in the HIV community opposed the approval for the once-a-day pill. There are concerns that circulation of such a drug could engender a false sense of security and mean people will take more risks. There have also been fears that a drug-resistant strain of HIV could develop. People diagnosed with HIV that without treatment develops into AIDS take antiviral medications to control the infection that attacks their immune system. In a statement, the FDA stressed that the drug should be used as part of a ""comprehensive HIV prevention plan"", including condom use and regular HIV testing. Studies show that Truvada reduced the risk of HIV in healthy gay men - and among HIV-negative heterosexual partners of HIV-positive people - by between 44% and 73%. ""In the 80s and early 90s, HIV was viewed as a life-threatening disease; in some parts of the world it still is. Medical advances, along with the availability of close to 30 approved individual HIV drugs, have enabled us to treat it as a chronic disease most of the time,"" Debra Birnkrant, director of the Division of Antiviral Products at FDA, said. GM bacteria prevents malaria transmission In a breakthrough, US scientists have genetically modified a bacterium to kill the parasite that causes malaria before it infects humans. Researchers at Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute said their breakthrough could help prevent mosquitoes from transmitting malaria to humans. Malaria kills over 800,000 people worldwide every year, most of them are children. In the new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers modified the bacterium, called Pantoea agglomerans, to secrete proteins that are toxic to the malaria parasite, but not harmful to the mosquito or humans. The bacterium is commonly found in the mosquito's midgut. It was found that the modified bacteria were 98 per cent effective in reducing the malaria parasite burden in the insects, the researchers said. "

Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a daily pill, Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV infection. A team of researchers from the University of Nebraska Medical Center is progressing towards developing weekly or twice-monthly injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) nanomedicines for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A long-acting, nanoformulated ART (nanoART) would be a substantive improvement over daily and sometimes more complex regimen of pills, lead investigator on the development of nanoART for HIV/AIDS and professor and chairman of the department of pharmacology and experimental neuroscience (PEN) at UNMC, Howard Gendelman, MD, said. A journal article hails the successful testing of UNMC’s ART injectables as treatment of HIV-infected mice and in preventing new infections. “We actually followed the process exactly as we would with a person – and it worked,” Dr. Gendelman said. “This is all very exciting. Although there are clear pitfalls ahead and the medicines are not yet ready for human use, the progress is undeniable.” Dr. Gendelman said one of the project’s real advantages is in the nanoformulations. “NanoART is cell directed. So when you take a pill, the pill travels throughout the body indiscriminately. In these nanomedicines, you can use the body’s own cells to direct the medicine where you want it to go,” he said. The UNMC project directs the medicine to the monocyte-macrophage, cells which carry the drug particle to sites of the body specifically where HIV grows. “You’re using the cell that is the target for the virus to deliver the drug against the virus,” Dr. Gendelman said. Dr. Gendelman calls the progress made “a Nebraska invention,” as it involved so many of the state’s scientists in different disciplines working together. He said this marks the third article his team has had published in major biomedical journals in recent months with all the articles related to the nanomedicine injectable therapy. The advance to use the new nanomedicines to specifically target reservoirs for viral infection was explained by Georgette Kanmogne, Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, lead investigator, and published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine. This paper describes how these drug inventions can enter the brain and ameliorate nervous system disease. The third study, published in Trends in Neurosciences, is a research area led by Larisa Poluektova, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, and the developer of the mouse models of HIV/AIDS used in study. “We work as a team and work effectively as a team with different scientists with very different disciplines involved in different aspects of the work,” Dr. Gendelman said. This research team is made up of two UNMC colleges, four departments and two universities. The drugs were developed in UNMC labs using nanoformulation approaches. The ART tests in mouse models were made possible by UNMC’s development of specially designed mice. Because mice cannot catch human HIV, UNMC has developed mice with the equivalent of a human immune system. Such a mouse model enables advanced tests on HIV and its treatment. Dr. Kanmogne said an ART injection would be an improvement for HIV patients because it would produce all the medicine needed without the complications of remembering to take pills daily, drug toxicities, buildup of viral resistance, intestinal problems, or the social stigma of pills. The work will be presented at the forthcoming meeting for the American Society for Nanomedicine, where Dr. Gendelman will serve as conference chair. The study has been recently published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases."
104,7,2012,Ending global HIV/AIDS pandemic is within our reach,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Ending-global-HIV/AIDS-pandemic-is-within-our-reach/articleshow/15107427.cms,"Ending the global HIV/AIDS pandemic may be possible by implementing a multifaceted global effort that expands testing, treatment, and prevention programs, as well as meets the scientific challenges of developing an HIV vaccine and possibly a cure, say researchers. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Bethesda, Md., made the recommendation at a JAMA media briefing at the International AIDS Conference. Among the most important interventions is combination antiretroviral therapy, which significantly improves the health and longevity of individuals infected with HIV. “Since the advent of antiretroviral therapy, the annual number of deaths due to AIDS has decreased by two-thirds in the United States. Globally, an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone due to the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries,” Dr. Fauci and Gregory K. Folkers, M.S., M.P.H., also of the NIAID, wrote. “Important challenges remain—notably finding the resources and developing the infrastructure to provide antiretroviral therapy to the estimated 8 million individuals with HIV infection who need these drugs but are not receiving them,” they noted. The researchers added that antiretroviral therapy could also prevent HIV infection by reducing the amount of virus in an infected person''s blood and other body fluids, making it less likely that the virus will be transmitted to others. Also, antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in blocking mother-to-child HIV transmission. Other important interventions include medical male circumcision, which offers a highly effective and durable way to protect heterosexual men from HIV infection; and potentially, pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medications, which have shown promise in reducing an individual''s risk of acquiring HIV infection. “Each of these treatment and prevention strategies has a strong evidence base; with further refinement and scale-up and also when used in combination, they could have an extraordinary effect on decreasing the trajectory of the HIV pandemic,” they said. They said researchers are maintaining focus on 2 key scientific challenges that remain: the development of a vaccine and a cure. They wrote that modest success in a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, promising results in animal models, and advances in structure-based vaccine design suggest that an HIV vaccine is feasible. The prospect of an HIV cure remains challenging. The researchers concluded that ending the global HIV/AIDS pandemic “will require a global commitment of resources involving additional donor countries, strengthening health care systems overall, and fostering greater ownership by host countries of HIV/AIDS effort, including investing more in the health of their people. With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach.” Their recommendation appeared in the latest issue of JAMA, a theme issue on HIV/AIDS.

Minister of state for labour Mangilal Garasiya on Monday said the policy will be formulated after a discussion with employers, labour unions and the state government. The policy will aim to achieve zero new HIV infections among workers. Garasiya was addressing a gathering of officials of Central government, state's labour department, International Labour Organization, Ministry of labour and employment and Rajasthan State Aids Control Society at a workshop on 'National Policy on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work' in the city. Garasiya said it should be the government's priority to prevent spread of HIV/AIDS among people in the age group of 15-49 years. ""The spread of HIV/AIDS among labourers has adverse impact on productivity; therefore, it is essential to check it."" Experts claimed that nearly 90% of the reported HIV infections are diagnosed in the most productive age group. The stigma and social discrimination towards HIV/AIDS patients also needs to be discouraged. Additional secretary, Union labour ministry Ravi Mathur said a National policy on HIV/AIDS and world of work has been recently formulated. He also stressed on the need for zero discrimination towards HIV patients at the workplace. Principal secretary, labour Lalit Mehra said, ""It is necessary to discuss with employers and labour unions before formulating workplace policy in the state."" The participants also talked about discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS at workplace. They advocated that such discrimination should not be happen in workplace as people living with HIV/AIDS have right to earn in a dignified way. The Union labour ministry also provided a checklist for planning and implementing a workplace policy and programme on HIV/AIDS. The objective of the workshop was to provide complete information of the national policy on HIV/AIDS in the world of work to help the stakeholders in developing plans to fight against HIV/AIDS in the world of work."

This August 15, Kripa Foundation, which works with recovering addicts, will celebrate its 31st Founders Day and it's been over 25 years since they started a branch in Goa at Anjuna. Pereira warns that because of this party culture, permissive sexual behaviour, specially among women, has also increased and Goa is sitting on a HIV time-bomb. ""Unfortunately Goan society has a false sense of status. They're into denial that they have any problem. They're so scared of shame that they will never admit that they're alcoholics or drug addicts. They would like to think that only the poor sections of society suffer from alcoholism or drug addiction,"" Pereira says. ""Earlier the flower children were our biggest inmates. They're our biggest supporters now,"" he informs. A certified Iyengar yoga instructor, Pereira advocates what he calls 'secular meditation' to bring about body, mind, spirit unity. ""Then your recovery process becomes much more authentic, because it bypasses your ego,"" he says, adding, ""without the grace of God you cannot do anything."" He also strongly feels that liquor tycoons like Vijay Mallya should set aside a portion of their profits to fund organizations which help alcohol addicts to recover. ""They're turning so many people into alcoholics. I'm not suggesting prohibition or anything. But I feel they should put a certain portion of their profits to lend a helping hand to those who wish to stop drinking,"" says Pereira."

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in a study found the existence of persistent reservoirs of dormant HIV in the immune system that are not attacked by anti-AIDS drugs, believed to be a major reason why infection re-emerges once patients stop taking their medication. The disruption of these reservoirs is critical to finding a cure for AIDS. Researchers at UNC, working in collaboration with scientists from the Harvard School of Public Health, National Cancer Institute and the University of California undertook a series of experiments designed to evaluate the potential of the drug vorinostat . Vorinosta is a deacetylase inhibitor that is used to treat some types of lymphoma, to activate and disrupt the dormant virus. Laboratory experiments measuring active HIV levels in CD4+T cells, which are specialized white blood cells that the virus uses to replicate, showed that vorinostat unmasked the hidden virus in these cells. Subsequently, vorinostat was administered to eight HIV-infected men who were medically stable on antiretroviral therapy and the levels of active HIV virus were measured and compared to the levels prior to administration.

Experts working to bring down the disease fear the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) will provide less funds for the city. Other states need more money to tackle HIV in NACP IV, said Dr Kishore Kshirsagar, project director, Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS). Dr Balkrisna Adsul, additional project director, MDACS, said funding will decrease as the HIV control programme will be part of general health. “It is the best thing that has happened as part of the AIDS control programme. By including HIV in general health, discrimination will be minimized,” he said. In 2011, 12,944 Mumbaikars were diagnosed sero-positive as compared to 1,73,016 in 2007. "

She said mass awareness, universal guidelines for immunization and hygienic handling of food and water can reduce the liver disease burden substantially. Menabde was speaking at the inauguration of the ‘Health Liver’ campaign by Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), India’s first NABH accredited super specialty institute. Delhi health minister AK Walia and K Srinath Reddy, director of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), among others, were present on the occasion. Menabde said there are five main hepatitis viruses, types A, B, C, D and E, of which B and C are most lethal as they can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. She added, “About six lakh people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis B, nearly 100 times more than HIV/AIDS.” Walia said that both hepatitis B and C spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. It can be through transfusion of infected blood, sharing of contaminated needles or injection material. Hepatitis B can also be transmitted from mother to child. “To check the spread of the disease through blood transfusion, we are going to introduce Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) to ensure immediate and accurate screening of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV in donated blood,” Walia said. He added that Delhi is among the first few states to have introduced vaccination for hepatitis B in the universal immunization programme. Hepatitis A and E, the commonest forms of viral hepatitis, spread mainly through contaminated food or water. The state health minister said that they are taking all measures to ensure clean drinking water facility to all citizens. The Delhi government is also planning to provide increased financial assistance to poor patients undergoing liver transplant, kidney transplant and other super-specialty procedures — Rs 3 lakh for those undergoing treatment at private hospitals and Rs 5 lakh for those being treated by government hospitals. According to Dr Shiv Sarin, director, ILBS, hepatitis rarely presents symptoms until very late. “For example, a person infected with hepatitis C virus may carry the virus for as long as 10 years or even 20 years without presenting any obvious symptom. Regular health check-up is advised for people above 40 years of age,” he said. "
110,7,2012,Government undecided on new HIV test,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Government-undecided-on-new-HIV-test/articleshow/15264720.cms," BHUBANESWAR: A high-level government committee is against introduction of a more accurate test to detect HIV in blood banks. The government is mulling to file a review petition in the Orissa high court against the court's July 28, 2011 order asking it to ensure the antigen test using nucleic acid amplification test in polymer chain reaction (NAT PCR) method to identify HIV infection in all blood banks against the ongoing test method called Elisa. Stating the reasons behind the government's reluctance, State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) director and convenor of the committee Dr K C Behera said studies show that the accuracy of the costlier NAT PCR test is not significantly higher compared to the Elisa method. ""There were various considerations. The government is yet to take a final decision. We will again meet the health secretary in this connection,"" Dr Behera said. Despite attempts, health secretary P K Mahapatra could not be contacted for comment. Sources said the committee in the health department during a recent meeting considered the findings of a Canadian study, which reportedly found that the NAT PCR method would help detect HIV in just one among one million blood units, which may be have been missed in Elisa test. Some members said the result was too insignificant. A doctor preferring anonymity said the Canadian study may not be relevant for Indian states. Awareness level among blood donors is very high in Canada where majority of blood donors are regulars, eliminating chances of window period due to periodic tests on them before each donation. Indian studies found detection rates of NAT PCR significantly higher compared to Elisa. A multi-centric Indian study undertaken in various centres including Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences Lucknow and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital New Delhi, published in Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2008, has found that NAT PCR can detect one in 1,500 units of blood, which otherwise remains undetected in Elisa method. The government's latest U-turn not to adopt NAT PCR comes around six months after another high-level committee on February 25 decided to adopt the test. The 15-member committee under the chairmanship of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) mission director Pramod Meherda had unanimously recommended the NAT PCR technology for screening of blood to reduce the 'grey zone' period of HIV, hepatitis B and C. The committee had suggested to roll out the test in a phased manner. It had recommend forming of another seven-member committee to decide on the modalities of the test like whether to invite expression of interest and funding pattern. However, the second committee favoured not to go for the test at all. The test, if introduced in six nodal blood banks across the state, would cover around Rs 11 crore to test over 1.81 lakh units of blood in a year. Sources said the automated NAT PCR machine is available at a cost of around Rs 3 crore. Blood banks, however, favour introduction of NAT PCR. ""It is definitely a better method that significantly reduces the window period of HIV. We would like to introduce the test in all our blood banks if the government gives financial support,"" said Indian Red Cross state branch honorary secretary Mangala Mohanty. Of the 81 blood banks in Odisha, 56 are being run by the Red Cross. The HC bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mahapatra had passed the order for a mandatory PCR test while adjudicating on the petition of a resident of Badamba in Cuttack district. The petitioner's son was transfused blood collected from a Red Cross blood bank in Municipal Hospital in Bhubaneswar before a surgery at Neelachal Hospital when he was 10 months old. He had tested positive for HIV at the age of 17 months."

Tamil Nadu previously ranked in the top three with 1.54 lakh HIV-positive people, it has now been overtaken by Karnataka (2.45 lakh), and West Bengal (1.67 lakh). Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for 5 lakh of the 24 lakh HIV positive in the country, remains the state with the most number of HIV-infected people, official statistics show. Government and private initiatives have helped reduce the number of people infected each year in the state, said officials of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TNSACS). “Around 27,000 people tested positive for HIV in the state in 2009,” said a TNSACS official. “In 2010, the number dropped to 23,000, and in 2011, it fell further to 20,000. That’s a decrease of 7,000 new cases in two years.” Activists attribute the success of the state’s AIDS programme to the commitment of the health sector and the government. “Tamil Nadu was the first state to start an autonomous AIDS control society and the model, backed by political will, has been very successful,” said Dr R Lakshmibai of Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative. “National AIDS Control Organisation has recommended the model to other states.” The state has benefitted from specialized target intervention programmes that go beyond focusing on vulnerable groups such as sex workers, said M Ramar of Centre for Social Development and Social Work Research in Coimbatore who runs intervention programs for migrant workers. “Once we started targeting their clients, which spans various groups like migrant workers, truckers and youngsters, things started looking better,” Ramar said. “I see a sense of awareness among migrant workers here. Fewer migrant workers than before are testing positive each year. Red ribbon clubs are also doing good work at college level.” According to Dr Lakshmibai, intervention programmes prevented the disease from reaching generalised epidemic proportions. “There are three levels — nascent epidemic, concentrated epidemic and generalised epidemic,” she said. “The state never let it reach the generalised stage. When it looked like our intervention programs were only creating awareness and not changing behaviour, the state brought in specialised programmes.” Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, shut down 266 of its first-level detection and counselling centres due to a cash crunch. However, Dr Lakshmibai added that although Tamil Nadu is doing well, sustaining the effort to reduce the incidence of new cases will be a challenge. “Trends and sexual behaviour keeps changing,” she said. “Agencies have to keep track of all developments while designing preventive programmes.” The state also has its work cut out in its intervention programme for transgenders. “The first survey was done only recently and shows that 9% of transgenders in the state are HIV-positive, a higher ratio than the 6% of female sex workers,” Dr Lakshmibai said.

Many times, the government representatives themselves are either unaware or not sensitive enough to work for the People Living with HIV (PLHIV). The condition of children living with HIV (CLHIV) is still worse with not many paediatricians versed with care required for these children. These were amongst the few grievances expressed by HIV positive people during the three-day grassroots level advocacy workshop organized by NGO World Vision India. Forty PLHIVs and many other NGOs participated. NGOs working in the field of HIV/AIDS like Sanjeevan, District Level PLHA Network, Eficor, Saathii, CRTDP, IID, Women Resource Center, Sharansthan, National Council of Churches in India also participated. ""The workshop aimed to strengthen the advocacy capacity of communities to address the issues faced by women and children living with HIV in different areas of the district. We wanted the PLHIVs to get the attention they deserve from the policymakers, the media, and society,"" said Joe George, programme officer of World Vision Nagpur. The participants discussed several practical difficulties faced by them every day. ""There are no facilities for AIDS patients at village level. With the government deciding to link us with the NRHM workers, this may change. For children suffering from the disease, it would make a huge difference if government provided them nutrition,"" said Anil Dalve, president of Network for PLHIV in Maharashtra. ""The number of ART centres in the state is insufficient if we consider the fact that Maharashtra has 14% of the Indians with the disease. All these people will soon require second line treatment too. I hope the government plans to open more centres,"" said Dalve. Daisy David, a PLHIV who now works as an advocacy associate, believes the government has good structure but what they lack is implementation and monitoring. ""When the district programme officers for AIDS speak to the NGOs working at the grassroots, they discuss projects and funds but rarely issues. They can't travel to all the villages under their jurisdiction and are unaware of the shortcomings in medical services in many of them,"" she said. If these authorities could guide and help the PLHIVs, things could improve a lot, she said. BOX: COMMON STIGMAS IN HOSPITALS * Discrimination while conducting any diagnostic process *Operations are delayed, even the emergency ones including appendicitis, heart surgery *Even government hospitals refuse to admit pregnant women or conduct deliveries * Private hospitals keep referring patients to government hospitals OTHER PROBLEMS *Block level PLHIV are not having proper information on welfare schemes *Viral load is not done in Nagpur district NEEDS OF THE POSITIVE PEOPLE *Community Care Centre services *Funeral support *Care home for children SUGGESTION *Hospitals should have a separate ward for positive patients where the staff is well trained as well as free of prejudices *Platform be given to the NGOs who are not recipient of MSACS funds. *Coordination of NGOs working in the HIV sector to be initiated by the SACS/NACO *Information on updated government's welfare schemes and job opportunities be given to the stakeholders to improve the quality lifestyle *Establishment and functioning of block level link ART centers *Rural Hospitals should be equipped proper infrastructure, human resources to handle the PLHAs' delivery cases *Capacity building initiatives for PLHIVs * Proper care be given to Children living with HIV by providing paediatric doctors in ART centers, nutrition support and children education support. ends"

According to officials of the Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS), which conducts targeted intervention projects for high-risk groups, migrant labourers and more specifically men having sex with men (MSMs) among them is a category that has been completely neglected in the state. “They are a category that remains totally unchecked. We are yet to launch projects specifically targeting MSMs among the migrant labour community. They pose a serious risk of spreading HIV infection in the society as they have started to mingle with local people for money and sexual gratification,” said KSACS (targeted intervention) joint director Dennis Joseph. Kochi has nearly 1,200 MSMs who are registered and covered under various projects of the KSACS. “We have programmes focusing on MSMs from the lower strata who need to be made aware of safe practices. But they don’t include migrant labourers. Moreover, a large number of MSMs belong to the economically upward bracket and operate in a different platform compared to the lower strata,” he said. While the audited figure is 1,200 for all categories of MSMs, the unofficial figure in the city is around 4,000 to 5,000, who come mostly from migrant labourers and the economically upward class, according to Joseph. City shadow police sub inspector Muhammed Nizar said that activities of MSMs, whether it is migrant labourers or locals, are increasing in the city. “Money is the main factor that is attracting MSMs to the city,” said another police officer.

""The vaccine showed encouraging results during animal trial stages. The toxicology has been done. I am hopeful, the clinical trial will begin by next year,"" Dr Katoch said. He was in city to attend a meeting of the ICMR tribal health research forum at Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) in the city. A research team at the National HIV Reference Centre in AIIMS has developed the HIV-1 DNA vaccine. During animal trials in 1996, the vaccine gave immunity to mice and monkeys from HIV sub-type C, which constitute over 95 per cent of HIV infections in India. The vaccine research had faced problems in 2002 as activists staged protest against use of animals in the tests following which trials on monkeys were then shifted to IISc Bangalore. The research had come to a stop after retirement of the developer of the vaccine, Dr Pradeep Seth, from AIIMS earlier this year. Dr Seth had headed the microbiology department of the premier institute. ""ICMR has revived the efforts and all clearance will be hopefully in place by this year,"" he said. Dr Katoch said attempts were made in the country earlier also to develop HIV vaccines. However, two earlier vaccines for HIV were found to have limitations. The one developed by Dr Pradeep Seth in AIIMS is being regarded very promising and may bring paradigm shift in the HIV prevention strategy in future, Dr Katoch said. He said vaccine making is not a priority of ICMR, which is being looked after by the department of biotechnology. However, ICMR is trying its best to facilitate development of certain vaccines such as the one for HIV, which has big relevance for India, he said."

Thirty HIV-affected persons from the district will be trained in the manufacture of detergent soaps, soap powder, phenyl, paper covers, office files, palm-craft and rearing nursery plants. The 10-day training organised by the Women's Project, is being conducted by experts from the Rural Development and Self Employment Trust (RUDSET). Inaugurating the training session, district collector Anshul Mishra said that it was an initiative to rehabilitate persons affected with HIV in the district. and that they should use the training effectively to learn the skills. Sending out a strong message to the public, the collector insisted that AIDS is not a communicable disease and hence the public need not be afraid to procure goods manufactured by them. ""People affected by HIV should not feel discouraged. They can lead a normal and healthy life through regular treatment and can involve themselves in self-employment trades like anyone,"" he said. R Ganesan, joint director/project officer, Women's Project said the training would consist of more practical sessions. ""The participants will master the various skills in the 10-day training. We will then put them into groups based on their interest of trade. Along with the training, we will arrange bank loans through the District Lead Bank and also allot shops in Poomalai Complex for them. We will also utilise the van in the Women's Project to promote the mobile sales unit,"" he said. The district administration had held a preliminary meeting about the training on July 27, where 60 HIV- affected persons had participated. They were briefed on the project and 30 of them registered for the training, Ganesan said."

Ironically, India still seems to be grappling with problems of what some call 'an invisible population group' - Children Living with HIV (CLHIV). With insufficient government facilities for them, these children have become the first casualties of the drying up of funds being forwarded towards HIV affected people, nationally and internationally. Along with the social and psychological trauma that these kids have to go through, the physical troubles they suffer also multiply in the absence of medical services for them. Most of the NGOs who were working for this deprived lot have either phased out or are in the process of phasing out their projects. Last year, National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) withdrew financial support from many social outfits associated with the cause. ""A very few doctors understand the need of HIV-infected children. and so provide care to them. Despite being innocent recipients of the virus for no fault of their own, these children are forced to live a life full of despair and denial,"" said Samir Shinde, who has been working since the last few years to improve the condition of CLHIV. He also says that the facilities for screening and check-up of these children are insufficient. ""There is no focused government or NGO programme for the kids. Even the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) medicine dosages are too strong for most children, which is a reason for other health problems,"" he added. Madhuri Giri, project coordinator for Sanjeevan, another NGO working for the positive people, said that efforts made by activists end up wasted because of changing government authorities. ""We have discussed the issues with many officials but they get transferred before they can act on the suggestions. In terms of government schemes, these children come under ICDS, where too there is no special mention of their special health and nutritional needs,"" she said. Pointing out that organizations will only help the kids till they have the project or the money, Giri underlined the need for a government project towards this end. Lack of medical facilities for the children is amongst is another big hurdle, believes social worker Manohar Roy from Eastern Studies Society. ""There is no paediatrician trained to deal with the other infections that afflict these kids because of their weaker immunity. As opposed to this, the facilities for the elders are a little better and improving. This is simply because a Person Living with HIV (PLHIV) is a part of the vote bank, children are not,"" he said. If the dos and don'ts are explained to these kids properly, it is possible for them to be a part of the society, he said while explaining the need for emotional, psychological and medical counselling for the kids. Director of India Peace Centre John Chelladurai agrees and adds, ""To an extent, some facilities are still there in urban and district centres but not in smaller towns and villages. We can't keep blaming the government as society also needs to be more proactive."" Education may have become the right of every child, but not many schools readily accept children having AIDS, said Harshan KY of Eficor. ""Most of these children become orphans early with nobody to take care of them. From the government's side, all they get is ART treatment, but no nutritional support that can help them have stronger immunity,"" he said. Support Suggestions Focused programme aimed to improve the condition of Children Living with HIV (CLHIV) At least one doctor of each discipline in every city should be trained to handle these children Private schools can also take up at least one positive child each Dosage of medicines be made suitable for children Providing facilities like institutional care, palliative care and immunization for the children Nutritional support, in the form of health supplements like vitamins, along with ART provided by government Making care takers aware of the special immunization schedules for CLHIVs Counseling of High Risk Groups to limit the number of children who are born with the infection City NGOs' 24x7 care centre for +ve kids Looking at the dismal way of life Children Living with HIV (CLHIV) are forced to live in the country, some city NGO's decided to change the scenario. Having completed three years of running a day care centre Tehillim Ministries of Charity (TMC), Maharashtra Positive Women's Network and National Integration Society, they are now aiming at establishing a centre of excellence for CLHIVs. They will now be extending the care provided in their centre to be available 24x7. The ever increasing number of children with the disease, most of whom have lost their parents, they say are denied treatment in government establishments and can't afford that provided by private institutions. The centre will also be providing the children counseling and treatment facilities. ""With constant care being very necessary for these kids, we thought of supporting them in every possible way. Also, if the government can not provide something, instead of complaining, we thought of taking up their cause,"" said Jefferey Nelson, president of TMC, while explaining the idea behind the centre of excellence. Most CHLIVs are either orphan or semi-orphan, so they do not get the constant care they need, said Varsha Gaikwad, president Positive Women's Network. ""They need regular follow-ups for which not many doctors are available. Also, preventive care is more important for them in the absence of which they know the existence of diseases only when it is in the last stage,"" she said. Since the volunteers of these organizations have known most of the kids through the years and know their medical history, they are better equipped to help them, she believes. President of National Integration Society Achchelal Chauhan believes that the project acquires more importance since the government facilities available earlier do not exist any longer. ""The government provided facilities like Community Care Centre (CCCs) earlier. But that too was shut down a year ago. The children are being provided with medicines by the government, but not the necessary information and emotional support,"" he said. For support or queries call on 9890915857."

This would be in addition to the 10 ART centres already existing in the state. This was announced by health minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey here on Thursday. The state government has also decided to give preference in jobs to people with AIDS, while process is also on to provide pension to them. People with AIDS would also be carried free to and fro the ART centres. All these measures were announced on Thursday when a specially designed train, Red Ribbon Express, entered Bihar via Kishanganj district. The train, which will pass through Bihar in two phases, August 23- September 10 and October 13-October 29, would cover 16 districts of Bihar. Red Ribbon Express has special audio-visual systems to create awareness about causes of HIV/AIDS. It also has a condom vending machine, a Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) official said. It was flagged off from New Delhi on January 12 this year. Choubey said there was an urgent need to involve more and more people in creating awareness about AIDS at every level as there is a misconception that it is a contagious disease. It occurs due to unsafe sex, contaminated blood transfusion and from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding, Choubey said, adding involving rural people, particularly youth, in this programme would help create awareness about it. Awareness would also be created at different fairs of the state, including the Sonepur fair, the minister said. There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 50,000 are HIV +. The largest number of HIV+ people are in Patna district. Migration of people from other districts to Patna for treatment has increased the number of HIV positive people in the district, a health department official said. There are 207 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres where people are tested for HIV and counselled if they like, Choubey said. ""Bihar has sought help from the Centre for making arrangements of HIV/AIDS investigation at every health centre across the state."""

Initial investigations at a local hospital showed that he has not been infected, but the man, Xu Tian, remains in fear, state media quoted health officials as saying. Xu felt the peculiar pain of a needle on his left knee on entering the taxi on August 21. He then found a syringe sticking out of the magazine rack behind the car's front seat. Xu took the syringe to Chaoyang District Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and after a few preliminary tests it was found that the fluid in it was HIV-infected. Xu's blood test results were HIV negative. ""Even if there are HIV antibodies in the fluid, it does not mean that the virus is definitely still alive, given that it is very fragile outside the human body,"" Jiang, a doctor. Doctors are optimistic about Xu's well-being but have asked him to be vigilant and that it will take three months to rule out the possibility completely. His girlfriend now wants to break up leaving Xu depressed, Beijing News said. It was not clear how the syringe made its way to the taxi."
120,8,2012,Hunt for HIV Slayers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Hunt-for-HIV-Slayers/articleshow/15723494.cms,"The Blood Of A Rare Set Of HIV-Infected Who Have Led Healthy Lives May Hold Vital Clues To Designing The Elusive AIDS Vaccine NEW DELHI: Almost 25 years after she identified India's first six cases of HIV way back in 1986, Dr Suniti Solomon is on another pathbreaking hunt - to find a 'broadly neutralizing antibody' (bNab) from the blood of an Indian HIV patient. There's a global hunt on for bNabs, a set of antibodies that can be found in the blood of HIV patients. These antibodies are capable of stopping the HIV virus from entering blood cells and replicating , thereby arresting an HIV-infected person's progression to AIDS. (An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.) Called Protocol G, the global project to identify bNabs was started in 2006 by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI). So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 bNAbs identified. Margaret McGlynn, IAVI president told TOI that these special antibodies hold vital clues to the design of an effective AIDS vaccine that has eluded scientists so far. The Chennai-based Solomon is busy identifying a rare tribe of HIV-infected patients from across India who've been healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). These people are called ""elite controllers"" . ""The goal is to isolate antibodies that are broadly effective against Clade C subtype of HIV, which predominates in India,"" McGlynn added. The blood samples collected are sent to the all-new Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI) in Gurgaon where scientists will isolate antibodies for testing and see if any of them can stop a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells. Solomon, who works at YR Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE) said, ""Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These are essential to the virus's ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target."" Till now, blood samples from 39 elite controllers have been collected. ""We look for patients who've been infected for over four years but have not required ART. We estimate that of 100 such people, 20% would contain a bNab. We are collecting their blood samples and isolating cells that produce the bNab."" Solomon's team aims to collect samples from 200 elite controllers. ""If IAVI manages to isolate a bNab from any of these blood samples, we will call the patient back and collect 200 ml of blood from him or her over a period of six months. We will then prepare more bNabs from it and try to develop a vaccine,"" she says. IAVI India chief Rajat Goyal says these antibodies could ultimately reveal the Achilles' heel of the virus and help create the HIV vaccine . Experts at the THSTI will look at how the bNab binds to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus the vaccine should target. ""The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection,"" experts said. ""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable in the fight against HIV. A broadlyeffective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset,"" said M K Bhan, secretary of the department of biotechnology. No bNabs have yet been isolated in the India programme . But it's early days yet, said McGlynn. ""Serum samples collected will first be analyzed for their breadth of neutralization of HIV - in other words, the variety of HIV strains they can neutralize in laboratory assays. The most broadly neutralizing sera will be further analyzed to isolate and clone the antibodies responsible for that activity."" Those antibodies will then be studied in detail for their biochemistry and, if possible, molecular structures and the structures that each targets on the HIV virus . The package of information gleaned will then be put to use to design a new class of the Aids vaccine. Vaccine against HIVWhy is it so hard to find it? Mutable | HIV is among the most mutating/ changing viruses. If it had an unchanging part, this could be used to teach immune system to neutralize HIV variants Controls Not Known | It's not known which elements of immune response can be used to control HIV because no one has ever been 'cleared' of it Rapid Action | Immune system has narrow window of opportunity to neutralize HIV before it infects for life All about bnabs What is a bNab | Antibody that can stop HIV sub-types from infecting target cells. They're produced by white blood cells Do HIV infected have bNabs? | Only a few HIVinfected produce bNAbs Why bNabs are important | Though mutable, parts of HIV are relatively changeresistant . These are key to its ability to infect white blood cells and multiply. These are parts of HIV that bNAbs target Research on bnabs BNabs known | In 2009, two bNAbs isolated. Over next two years, a handful isolated from HIV+. Recently, 17 bNAbs discovered. Total 19 bNabs known Use of bNabs in Aids vaccine | BNAbs' action reveal vulnerabilities of HIV. Scientists can use info on how bNAbs bind to HIV to build immunogens. More the number of such antibodies researchers have, more clues they get about how best to attack HIV with a vaccine "

A meeting in this regard was held by the state Women and Child Welfare Department in view of the growing number of HIV cases in the state. A few years ago, the proposal of pre-marriage mandatory HIV test was floated, but did not gain ground. Officials in the department said the Centre had returned the proposal of Goa government to amend the Hindu Marriage Act and make HIV test mandatory before marriage. ""It was also decided that if there were hurdles in the enactment of such a legislation, steps will be taken to create awareness among the youth to go for HIV tests on their own,"" officials added. "
123,9,2012,Govt to introduce nucleic acid test to detect HIV infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Govt-to-introduce-nucleic-acid-test-to-detect-HIV-infection/articleshow/16158390.cms," BHUBANESWAR: After much dithering, the state government on Saturday said it would soon introduce the nucleic acid amplification test in polymer chain reaction (NAT PCR) method for screening blood before transfusion. NAT PCR is regarded as the most accurate test to identify HIV infection, far more dependable than the Elisa and rapid test kit methods in which HIV may remain undetected for a prolonged window period. Making the announcement during an adjournment motion discussion in the Odisha assembly, health minister Damodar Rout said the test was quite costly and the government had decided to introduce the test at the three government-run medical colleges and the Capital Hospital in the first phase. It will be introduced at other places in a phased manner, he added. Admitting that two specific cases of HIV transmission through contaminated blood had come to the government's notice, the minister said, ""The government will take all required steps to ensure people have access to safe blood."" Rout explained that the window period of HIV non-detection is 89 days in rapid test kits, and 21 days in Elisa method. In case of NAT PCR, the window period is only seven days. The minister further said the government had decided to abolish the rapid test method completely as it had the highest margin of error. The National AIDS Control Organization and National Blood Transfusion Council have no directives to conduct NAT PCR tests, but countrywide, around 20 blood banks use the method, he informed the house. Raising the motion earlier, Congress chief whip Prasad Harichandan wanted to know what steps the government had taken in view of the ""increase in instances of infected blood being given by blood banks."" Citing a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the law maker said the prevalent methods were unsafe. The ICMR study, undertaken in various centres including the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2008. It shows that the NAT PCR method can detect one HIV positive case in every 1,500 blood samples tested negative in the Elisa method. The test, if introduced in six nodal blood banks across the state, would cost around Rs 11 crore to test over 1.81 lakh units of blood in a year. An automated NAT PCR machine costs around Rs 3 crore. The Orissa high court, in July 28, 2011, had asked the state government to ensure that the NAT PCR method is used identify HIV infection. A bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mahapatra had passed the order while hearing the petition of a resident of Badamba in Cuttack district. The petitioner's son was transfused blood collected from Red Cross Blood Bank in Municipal Hospital in Bhubaneswar before a surgery at Neelachal Hospital when he was 10-month old. He tested positive for HIV at the age of 17 months."

""The programme is aimed at facilitating the treatment of poor children suffering from HIV,"" a senior officer of the district administration said. The expenses for the programme would be borne from Sarva Sikshya Abhiyan (SSA) funds, district collector Krishan Kumar said. Sources said around 100 children in the age group of six to 14 years would be benefited by the programme. Coordinator of District Primary Education Project (DPEP) A K Mishra said the traveling expense of the children and their escorts would be disbursed through the medical college authorities. Each HIV-affected child in the six to 14 year age group would come under the purview of the programme, he added."

The state women and child development department is actively considering the move. Varsha Gaikwad, minister, women and child development, told TOI that her department would be consulting various sections of the society in this regard. She added that the department had already sought opinions from NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients and the UNICEF among others in this context. Department officials said that the minister also had plans to convene a meeting of stakeholders in the next few days to discuss the pros and the cons of the move. The move will require amendment to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts. During the recently completed monsoon session of the state assembly, legislator Shirish Shinde of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had moved a private members' bill suggesting the necessary amendments. Department officials said that the opinion among elected representatives in this regard was divided. At a meeting held during the monsoon session, some legislators raised questions on whether the climate for introducing such a move was right. The official said that while all legislators were of the opinion that pre-marriage HIV tests must be encouraged, opinion on whether to make it mandatory was divided. The move is aimed at saving the predicament of individuals who become AIDS victims because of their partners. A pre-marriage test would act as a preventive measure, the official said. The bone of contention that is up for debate is whether making these tests mandatory would ostracize the infected person in his/her community. The state government has been working with NGOs to design projects for alleviating the social discrimination of victims. A fear that making tests mandatory would defeat this cause has been expressed, officials said. The department is hoping to resolve the dilemma through effective dialogue. Dr Arun Bamne, project director, Maharashtra District Aids Control Society (MDACS), felt that the tests should be voluntary. ""Making it mandatory will infringe on the person's right,"" he said."

The drugs are administrated to patients with low CD-4 count in their body system. Many old and new HIV positive patients are waiting to know their CD-4 count so that they can take the ART accordingly. Regular monitoring of the CD-4 count is important for the medicine to be effective. The CD-4 should be counted every six months, the doctors said. At present, 1,945 patients are being treated at the ART, Berhampur centre. Most of these patients are from Ganjam district that has the highest number of persons living with the HIV (PLWHIVs) in the state. As many as 9,768 persons had tested positive for HIV in the district by July-end. The number of HIV positive persons in the state in the same period was 25,788, sources added. Health activists said PLWHIVs coming to ART for their CD-4 test are facing many difficulties. ""Most patients are poor and they are not keen to come for the CD-4 test again going by the expenses involved,"" said Loknath Mishra, director, ARUNA, an NGO working for HIV positive patients in Ganjam district. A doctor in the ART centre said they administrated the drugs to patients by observing some other conditions. Similarly, the pre-ART treatment was provided, at least for a fortnight, to the new HIV patients. ""Treatment has not been completely stopped due to the defunct CD-4 machine,"" the ART doctor said. Medical college authorities said they were trying to repair the machine as quickly as possible. ""We have invited engineers from outside the state,"" said principal Sonamali Bag. The medical college has also requested the National AIDS Control Society (NACO) to replace the machine with a new one, she added. The CD-4 machine was installed by NACO in 2008."

The order comes after the guardians of the boy, who was three days old at the time of the operation, filed a complaint against Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital (KSCH), and the HOD of paediatric surgery at Lady Hardinge Medical College &amp; KSCH, Dr Ajay Kumar. Noting that the minor contracted a serious disease due to which he cannot survive long, the Commission has awarded Rs 10 lakh as compensation for “mental agony,” “harassment,” and litigation charges. The boy’s parents had asked for a compensation of Rs 22 lakh along with Rs 30,000 as litigation expenses. The Commission referred the matter to the medical board of Maulana Azad Medical College, which said, “It was incumbent on the part of the doctor who transfused the blood to a patient, screening for HIV should have been done.” There was nothing on record to show how the doctor came to the conclusion that the blood was not contaminated, said the order. The Commission was also shocked at the doctor’s defence that the blood was tested at the blood bank and had no HIV infection. “It is very strange that Dr Ajay Kumar has not filed any affidavit to show that such a test was conducted by the blood bank,” stated the order. Taking note of the evidence on record, the order said, the patient had an ailment called FUC-Diaphragmatic for which he was operated on June 12, 1998. It is on account of medical negligence that the minor has HIV. “The transfusion of the blood to the patient is not in dispute. Obviously, there is sheer medical negligence on the part of opposing parties in not examining the blood and ensuring that it does not contain any HIV infection,” stated the order passed by Commission members VK Gupta and Salma Noor. The Commission also took into account that the child could not have inherited the ailment from his parents since there were “ample documents” to show that the parents did not have HIV infection in their blood. In the complaint the guardians stated that on June 12, 1998, a three-day-old baby was admitted to the children’s hospital for a FUC-Diaphragmatic surgery . The parents were asked to release 1.5 ml of blood for the surgery. After the surgery , the child was discharged . However, the minor was again admitted to the hospital in August 1998 with the same problem along with a Mal rotation Adhesive Intestinal Obstruction due to which the child was not accepting feed. The guardians claimed that ever since the operation the child had not remained healthy and till 2005 he consistently suffered from fever, pneumonia and cough. In a joint statement to the Commission, the health ministry, the hospital, the doctor and the blood bank have denied all allegations. TOI received no response from the hospital on whether it has made appeals to higher commissions. prerna.sodhi@timesgroup.com "

Justice D Hariparanthaman, allowing the plea of the driver who tested positive for HIV in January 2010, said: “It is settled that the transport corporation is bound to provide alternative employment, if the medical board finds that he could not do heavy work. It is admitted that the petitioner is an AIDS patient and the medical board found that he could discharge light duties.” 	The driver joined the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation’s Salem division as a daily wager in May 1998 and in September 1999 his services were regularised. After an unblemished service for more than 11 years, he started falling ill frequently. In January 2010 he tested positive for HIV and began treatment at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem. 	He was unable to discharge his regular duties due to his illness and was forced to take all the available leave. The management initiated punitive action against him for unauthorised absence from March 12, 2011. His representation to the authorities that his continued absence was due to his medical condition and action against him be dropped fell on deaf ears, as he was directed to appear before the corporation medical officer for examination. 	On October 15, 2011, the medical officer of the corporation examined him and found him ‘not fit’ for the driver’s job. 	He immediately approached the Madras high court invoking Section 47 of the Persons With Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, seeking alternative employment with pay protection. After this petition was filed, he was referred to a medical board at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem. On April 9, 2012, the board found that he could not do heavy work, but could be used for light work. When the matter was taken up for hearing, the management informed the court that appropriate orders would be passed soon on the basis of the medical board’s report. 	Justice Hariparanthaman, however, cited the mandatory duty of the management under the PWD Act and said the driver should be provided with alternative employment within two weeks, and his pay too should be protected by the authorities.

134,10,2012,Census of HIV+ migrants in Jarkhand gains momentum,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/Census-of-HIV-migrants-in-Jarkhand-gains-momentum/articleshow/16762088.cms," times news network ALLAHABAD: Following Allahabad being termed by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) biggest host of HIV/Aids-infected persons in Uttar Pradesh, officials of the UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) are working at a breakneck pace to collect block level data (BLD) to ascertain the exact figure of HIV/AIDS patients. The NACO has placed five UP districts, including Allahabad, Azamgarh, Deoria, Etawah and Banda under its scanner after these districts were placed under sensitive category in migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons. Allahabad being termed most sensitive, greater stress is being laid on collecting actual data of victims from all 20 blocks of the district and offering treatment and counseling to patients. UPSACS officials of are carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment as well as assistance. They are also conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV.. Nodal officer, District Aids Programme Control Unit ( DAPCU), Dr O P Shahi told TOI that migrant labourers, truckers and MSM (men having sex with men) were being identified in the district as they were most responsible for and vulnerable to spread of the deadly disease. He added that efforts were underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling. During surveys, it has come to notice that victims due to various reasons including social stigma, do not come forward and reel under depression, said Dr Shahi. Three kinds of migrants are primarily responsible for the spread of the deadly disease including workers at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who migrate from one state to another for employment. Dr Shahi said under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities are busy locating the infected persons with the aim of offering them treatment, assistance and counseling. Officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and men having sex with men (MSM) so that concrete measures could be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus. UPSACS officials have also been spreading awareness under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme. Last year, a NACO monitoring committee visited the city to find reasons behind the rapid increase in transmission of HIV in the district. The team had also inspected services being offered to HIV+ and AIDS patients at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC). The NACO initiative comes in the wake of Allahabad being placed under the high risk group as far as spread of HIV is concerned. Dr Shahi informed that the villages prone to high risk have been put under the scanner and a series of awareness and educational camps are being launched to check the menace. Pointedly, NACO has also asked UPSACS to check the status of migrants living in these villages as they are among prime carriers of HIV in the district. As far as route of infection and risk transmission categories are concerned, in about 85.3 per cent cases the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users and others, respectively. Currently, three NGOs are implementing the targeted interventions among the high risk groups in the district covering commercial female sex workers (FSWs), men having sex with men (MSM) and Intravenous drug users."
135,10,2012,Cow's milk protects against HIV: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Cows-milk-protects-against-HIV-Study/articleshow/16847978.cms," MELBOURNE: Cow's milk can be potentially developed into affordable creams that can help protect humans against HIV, a study has claimed. Lead scientist from University of Melbourne Marit Kramski found that when pregnant cows were vaccinated with an HIV protein, the first milk produced by the cow after giving birth, called colostrum, produced high antibodies to protect its newborn against disease. Researchers were now planning to test the effectiveness and safety of the milk before turning it into a cream which will hopefully allow women to protect themselves against contracting the virus during sex, without relying on men, the Herald Sun reported. However, the final result could be a decade off. The researchers were able to inhibit the virus from infecting cells when combing the virus cells with milk. ""We think the antibodies bind to the surface of the virus and blocks the protein which needs to be freed to get in contact with human cells - like a key and lock system. If the key's not accessible or you change the key, you can't open the door,"" Kramski said adding ""It's a very cheap and easy way to produce a lot of antibodies."" Kramski had partnered with Australian biotechnology company Immuron Ltd to develop the milk, and would continue working with them to produce a preventative cream. ""We have the antibodies at the moment - the next step will be formulation,"" Kramski said. Condoms were ""cheap and easy"" but not an option for everyone with millions of people getting infected with HIV every year, she added. ""A lot of women, especially in Africa or South America they don't have the power to say you need to use a condom before we have sex. ""This milk looks like it can be a cheap, easy new prevention tool, because if you use drugs it's really expensive,"" she said."

Moon rocks fetch $330,000: A pair of lunar rocks, which originated on far side of the Moon, has sold for $330,000 at a meteorite auction in New York. The auction is estimated to have netted more than $1million from the sale of meteorites. The Moon slabs, each weighing around 907 grams, were the most expensive items sold at the auction, which was conducted by Heritage Auctions and featured more than 125 other pieces from around the solar system, the 'New York Daily News' reported. Missing sleep can erase memory: Researchers have found that memories can be lost for ever if you don't get enough sleep, and missing even two hours of slumber can stop the brain from storing them. Experts looked at how mice that were stopped from sleeping fared on a memory task. The creatures were kept awake for varying amounts of time. ""What we found is that when we deprived animals of sleep, that impaired storage of memories,"" lead researcher Ted Abel said."

Imagine the smell of delicacies and hit numbers from Bollywood flicks filling the air when you're surviving on IV drops. And imagine screams of ""aschhe bochhor abar hobe"" from the immersion procession making you think whether you can endure the pain for another year. What makes you shudder even in your imagination is the life of a group of patients undergoing treatment at the School of Tropical Medicine, which primarily treats HIV cases. Most of them don't hope to do what everyone does on Puja days any more as they're fighting a losing battle against the killer disease. ""So what they cannot step out, we can always step in,"" thought D Ashis, general secretary of Medical Bank. Thus began a unique initiative in which the organization started carrying the spirit of Durga Puja on the hospital campus. On the occasion of Panchami on Friday, doctors, attendants and members of the group shared some light moments with the patients to lessen their burden of pain. Sarees, dhotis and sweets were also distributed to bring a feeling of newness to their otherwise agonizing lives. ""With so many people caring for us, I feel like living again. Otherwise, the way we - the HIV patients - have been stigmatized makes me feel like a burden on the society,"" said Asmina Begumwith pain creased all over her face. Parmeet Singh, another HIV patient in the male ward, echoed: ""I've been destined to go through the pain, so there's no point complaining. But it really hurts when I think of how I spent the last Puja and what's in store this time. I've learnt that life doesn't give a second chance,"" he regretted. For Anima, however, it's a relief to be in the hospital. Since she was diagnosed with HIV virus, not a single day passed when her in-laws didn't abuse her. ""For me, spending a single fun-filled day in the hospital is better than four traumatic days at home during Durga Puja,"" she sighed. ""We need to treat the fear before we cure the disease. Life for these people wouldn't have been so miserable had the society been a little sympatheticto them. I feel such an initiative will act as an eye-opener for those whose feel HIV patients should be shunted out of our lives,"" said PK Guha, the hospital superintendent. (Names of all patients changed)"

These people are on the health department's scanner as they are more vulnerable for HIV infection. With the help of employment department, the health department has identified nine districts in the state from where thousands move to other states for jobs. Ajmer, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Pali, Sriganganagar, Bhilwara, Sikar, Nagaur and Bikaner are the nine districts. Project director, Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS), Dr JP Dhamija said: ""It would not be a forceful testing of HIV. We will only provide the facilities for HIV testing. Auxiliary nurse &amp; midwives, Anganwadi workers and ASHA workers have been roped in for spreading awareness about the facilities which we are providing in the nine districts. The aim for doing this is to halt or reverse the HIV/AIDS epidemic."" Meanwhile, a health official said that there is a link between spousal migration and women's HIV status. It is seen that more HIV positive had migrant husbands than HIV negative women. A Behaviour Sample Survey on single male migrants in Maharashtra in 2009 shows a very high proportion -76% of migrants did not perceive any risk of HIV. Of the total migrants, only 13% have ever tested for HIV. RSACS would organize camps in every nine districts from November 1 to 10. Also, it would make use of folk artists, announcements and also take the help of gram sabhas to spread awareness about the camps. The other facilities that would be provided at the camps would be general health check-up, antenatal checkups, condom promotion activities, HIV &amp; STI counselling, inter-personal communication, HIV screening facilities, health exhibitions etc."

The 23-year-old, married for the past one-and-a-half years, has tested positive for HIV and she knows she has contracted it from her husband. Her family is distraught but there’s little they can do. “Now, we realise the importance of getting an HIV test done before marriage,” says her father. Madhu’s is not the only case. Many such instances across the country are highlighting an urgent need to make HIV test mandatory before marriage. The State Women and Child Development department is actively considering the move. In fact, Varsha Gaikwad, Minister, Women and Child Development, recently said that her department had sought opinions in this regard from UNICEF and NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients. But to bring about this rule, amendments to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts, will be needed. And even though it looks like the need of the hour, it’s not that simple. In the past, such a move has encountered a number of hindrances. Why some people are opposing the move: Some argue that making this test mandatory infringes upon a person’s right to privacy, which is a fundamental human right. Also, a big concern is that post-tests, an infected person may be ostracised in his/her community. A generalised policy like this could adversely affect HIV control programme itself, as fear of social discrimination could force people to flee rather than come forward to declare their HIV status. That apart, there are people opposing it because of the veracity of HIV tests. A wrong diagnosis could cause havoc in a person's life. Besides, there is something called a window period during which a person may test negative despite being infected. Says gynaecologist Dr Firuza Parekh, ""The HIV test is not fool-proof. At the time of testing, a person may come negative but turn positive six months later due to the window period. That apart, there's also the question of who will bear the cost of the test. So, what are we trying to prove through these tests? Is it just promiscuity because in that case, a person could even cheat by getting somebody else's test result."" Sexologist and marriage counsellor Dr Shirish Malde, agrees. ""People might resort to getting fake test reports. Also, asking for this test can give rise to certain trust issues,"" he says. But the fact is that there are many cases where a person has contracted the virus from his/her partner and often it comes to fore when the woman is pregnant, he says. ""And the person who was already infected at the time of marriage tends to pretend or actually may not even have been aware. So making such a test mandatory before marriage may help,"" This test is as important as kundlis: In Mumbai, a large section of people, especially youngsters, are of the opinion that the test must be made mandatory.

Dr I S Gilada, President of AIDS Society of India, who has been working in this field for almost three decades, emphasises, ""This step may upset some people in our traditional society who might even call of a marriage. It's mainly young unsuspecting women who suffer in this. Human rights activists may say that declaring HIV status of one person to the other is violation of his/ her privacy. But doesn’t the potential spouse have a right to be protected from the disease? One’s right to privacy cannot infringe upon another’s right to life. In fact if it is made mandatory, there will be more awareness and more people going in for regular checkups."" What's the solution: Instead of just an HIV test, a couple about to get married could undergo a comprehensive health check-up that includes tests for diabetes, thalassemia, haemophilia and other sexually transmitted diseases.

In principle it seems logical enough: both partners should make an informed decision. But by legalising the process, not only do you bring the state into the bedroom, you also stigmatise HIV further. After all, there are many conditions that must be ascertained before we enter a partnership. Why aren’t those investigated? Nandana Sen, actress: Making the test mandatory could intensify the inhuman stigmatisation that HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients grapple with.

143,10,2012,"Spot cancer, HIV with naked eye",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Spot-cancer-HIV-with-naked-eye/articleshow/17014121.cms," LONDON: Scientists have developed a new ten times cheaper ultra-sensitive sensor test to detect the early stages of several cancers and viruses, including HIV, with the naked eye. Researchers from the Imperial College London claim that their visual sensor technology is ten times more sensitive than the current gold standard methods for measuring biomarkers. These indicate the onset of diseases such as prostate cancer and infection by viruses including HIV. The colour of a liquid changes to give either a positive or negative result. Researchers say their sensor would benefit countries where sophisticated detection equipment is scarce, enabling cheaper and simpler detection and treatments for patients. The team tested the effectiveness of the sensor by detecting a biomarker called p24 in blood samples, which indicates HIV infection. ""Unfortunately, the existing gold standard detection methods can be too expensive to be implemented in parts of the world where resources are scarce,"" Professor Molly Stevens, from the Departments of Materials and Bioengineering, said. ""Our approach affords for improved sensitivity, does not require sophisticated instrumentation and it is ten times cheaper, which could allow more tests to be performed for better screening of many diseases,"" said Stevens. Researchers also tested samples for the biomarker called Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which is an early indicator for Prostate Cancer. The team say the sensor can also be reconfigured for other viruses and diseases where the specific biomarker is known. "

The PIL claimed that PCR test could reduce window period in the process. The high court completed hearing on the issue on Monday. The bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala sought opinions from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), the state government and the Controller of drugs on whether PCR test could reduce window period for check up to the time consumed at present in ELISA. Finally, the court also asked the National Institute of Biologicals to assist the court by explaining the issue. After receiving answers from all concerned expert bodies, the court reserved its order on the subject. During the proceeding of this PIL, the high court deleted petitioner Babulal Thakkar’s name from the litigation and prohibited him from participation in the proceedings. The court removed the petitioner from the PIL after it was brought to court’s notice that he had sought registration of FIR against prime minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and NACO director Satyen Chatterji for alleged corrupt practices. The court decided to continue with the PILs sans Thakker, who used to appear as party-in-person. The court held that the issue raised by the petitioner was of very serious nature and concerns public interest, said NACO’s counsel Amit Panchal."

Pradip, who is undergoing Anti-Retroviral Therapy (Art), is competing at the eighth Senior Mr Asia championship in Ludhiana in the first week of November. The next month, he will take part in the 4th Mr World Championship in Bangkok. A resident of Khamnam Leirak in Imphal West, Pradip (43) disclosed his health status to the media a few days after bagging the 60-kg category senior 'Mr Manipur' title in a state-level competition held here in December, 2007. Pradip, a brand ambassador of Manipur Aids Control Society (Macs), later bagged silver and bronze medals in different national competitions and stood eighth in the 'Mr World' competition. Manipur is one of the six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states of the country. According to Macs, the state has 38,016 people infected with HIV, including 10,109 women and 2,578 children. Pradip, who has emerged as an icon of inspiration to the world, spends around Rs 40,000 in procuring foreign nutritional diet every month. ""Macs, which used to pay Rs 8,000 a month for my nutritional support, has stopped extending the amount since June this year,"" Pradip informed TOI on Monday. ""The state government which had promised to appoint me as a regular employee in the youth affairs and sports department in 2009 also failed to do anything about it. This was another major setback,"" said Pradip. A group of HIV positive widows of the state launched a charity campaign to collect money for him after they came to know about his financial condition. They are providing me monetary help and I am very thankful to them, he said. Recently, a social organization donated Rs 1.5 lakh to the bodybuilder for his cause, he said. ""Since I do not have money, I am not in a position to procure the standard nutritional diet. But I am ready to fight all odds and I will manage to make it through. I will continue with my rigorous practice and give my best at both the competitions,"" he added."

Pradipkumar, who arrived at Imphal airport in the afternoon, was greeted by functionaries of All Manipur Gymnasium Welfare Association, his family members, well-wishers and members of Self Support Group (SSG), a body formed by HIV positive widows of the state. Before reaching his Khamnam Leirak residence in Imphal West in a motorcade, Pradip was given a fitting reception by teachers and students of Zenith Academy located near the airport. ""I'm feeling very happy after bagging the prestigious ""Mr South Asia"" title. I have proved that people living with HIV can do wonders. I'm facing a tough time ahead of the 4{+t}{+h} Mr World championship scheduled to be held in Bangkok next month as I lack funds to procure nutritional diet. But I'll go on for the title,"" said Pradip (43). The muscleman spends about Rs 40,000 in procuring nutritional diet every month. Pradip, who is on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART), faced great hardships in arranging money to buy nutritional diet few ahead of his ""Mr South Asia"" competition. Manipur Aids Control Society (MACS), which used to pay Rs 8000 a month to Pradipkumar for procuring his nutritional support after appointing him as its brand ambassador, has stopped paying the money to him since June. Another setback was the government's failure to appoint him as a regular employee in the youth affairs and sports department despite tall promises made by a minister in 2009. All was not lost for him as members of SSG carried out a charity campaign and gave Rs 90,000 to him. ""A local civil body christened ""Joint Brothers' Group"" also donated him Rs 1.5 lakh for his cause,"" said Pradip, who revealed his status after bagging the 60-Kg category senior Mr Manipur title in December, 2007. The muscleman has also bagged silver and bronze medals in different national competitions and also stood 8th in the Mr World competition. ""I would not have been in this position without the generous efforts of the SSG and Joint Brothers' Group, for which I'm grateful to them,"" said Pradip. ""Though governor Gurbachan Jagat, speaker Th Lokeshore and some ministers and MLAs donated money, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh didn't provide any assistance to me despite repeated pleas by SSG members. Instead, the CM's office staff ridiculed the SSG members,"" added Pradip. Manipur is one of the six high HIV prevalence states of the country. According to MACS, the state has 38,016 people infected with HIV, including 10,109 women and 2,578 children. "

Keeping this in view, sex workers in the twin cities have formed a peer group to educate fellow workers to take precautions while having sex to avoid HIV and other sexual transmitted diseases. A team of 25 sex workers, mainly women who are trained by Society for People Actions for Development (SPAD) an NGO, will visit areas where sex workers assemble and convince them to use condoms and undergo an HIV test every six months. Apart from educating, a team works on the treatment of HIV and other STDs for fellow sex workers. Some times, they also counsel couple suffering from HIV. According to the sources, twin cities have nearly 1400 sex workers, of them, 40% women sex workers are operating from homes while 60% are doing their profession on the streets of twin cities.Members of peer educators will visit all busy spots like slums, theatres, bus-terminus both old and new, market area, parks, gardens, and railway station where sex workers will wait in search of their customers. Speaking to TOI Shaila, Peer educator of SPAD, said sex workers from rural areas of Hubli, Dharwad, and Davangere, Haveri, Shiggaon,Bijapur will come to the city in search of customers.“We meet each sex worker personally and convince them to use condom to avoid STDs by giving condoms for free. Besides, every three months we take them for clinical check up and HIV test for every six months,” she added. “Our efforts have yielded good results as many sex workers are now aware of HIV and even ask their partners to use condoms. Initially, they refused to use condoms, but have gradually realized the importance of safe sex. There were instances when sex workers refused to have sex with their partners if they didn’t agree to use condoms,“ she said. "

I was a little scared in the beginning, but I made a lot of new friends,” she said coyly. Maya is among the 34 residents of a children’s home in Bandikavanur village, about 30km from Chennai, who stepped into a school for the first time on Wednesday after HIV played havoc in their lives. They are all children of HIV+ve people. While most of them have lost either or both of their parents, 19 of them inherited the virus. The children — 18 girls and 16 boys — were admitted to a primary school in the village in Thiruvallur district under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’s ‘Education for all’ scheme. For most of these children, the scheme gave them their first shot at leading a “normal” life. “I’ve often stood by the gate of the children’s home and watched school kids in uniforms jostle with one another. I wished I could join them and be their friend, but I wasn’t sure if they would accept me. Today, I finally got a chance to be a student,” said 10-year-old Mani*, who lost both his parents to HIV. The 34 children, from across the state, are currently under the care of the Community Health Education Society (CHES), which has a home in the village that houses 85 HIV infected and affected children. Most of them find schooling difficult because of opposition from the school authorities and other parents who know about their health status. Bandikavanur Panchayat Union Primary school principal N Shanthi said it wasn’t easy admitting these children. “In the beginning, we had decided not to reveal the children’s background, but word soon got around and we had parents approaching us asking if their wards would get infected. Explaining the situation wasn’t easy, but the panchayat head and elders in the village got together and explained things to them,” she said. The school also made provisions to cater to the medical needs of the children and the teachers are being trained to handle emergencies. For CHES, it marks the end of a 19-year struggle. “For close to two decades, we have been trying to send HIV-affected children to mainstream schools, but few would admit them. Even if they were admitted, the children would drop out as they couldn't bear the discrimination. This is the first time a whole bunch of our children have been admitted to a school at one go,” said its president Dr P Manorama. The NGO is also holding classes for these students to help them cope with their peers in the mainstream. (Names of the children have been withheld to protect their identity)"
151,11,2012,HIV-hit walk tough road to remarriage,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/HIV-hit-walk-tough-road-to-remarriage/articleshow/17164928.cms," TRICHY: Like normal people, HIV affected people are also longing to enter wedlock to renew their lives with much-needed positivity. In Trichy, the desire for remarriage is growing among widowers. However, very few widows who are HIV positive want to remarry. According to statistics from the district administration, there are 11,097 people including 6,654 males and 4,443 females who are HIV positive. Most of the women are said to have received the killer syndrome from their husbands. With a view to finding a suitable life partner for both men and women patients, two marriage information bureaus exclusively for HIV people have been functioning in Trichy for the past six years. The marriage bureaus neither encourage nor discourage marriage. They simply explain to them the merits and demerits of marriage and let the parties decide. On the other hand, the counsellors believe that such marriages might prevent HIV positive men from spreading the virus through affairs. The two marriage bureaus have so far received about 250 applications seeking life partners. Interestingly, most of the applicants are widowers between 30 and 50. However, the number of widow applicants are nearly 50. Since there is a possibility that babies born to such couples will become HIV-affected, the marriage bureaus counsel the pairs to have safe sex to avoid having children. But the couples seemingly want to have children. The HIV-affected men want to get married for various social and personal reasons. ""The decision to remarry involves many reasons. First, many widowers do not want to expose themselves by being alone. So, they want to marry to hide their disease. Some of them are forced by their families to get married. There are many persons who want to enter wedlock for marital consummation. Interestingly, a 50-year-old man has now applied for remarriage. Since 2008, we received 39 applications from men and five applications from women. But only 12 marriages have taken place so far and seven children have been born through such marriages. All the children tested HIV negative,"" said A Thamil, a HIV positive person who runs Network for Positive People in Trichy. Thamil also said, ""Most women are affected by HIV because of their husbands. Many of them have begotten children through their marriage. Unfortunately, the sudden deaths of their husbands put the future of both mother and child at risk. Nevertheless, they do not want to think of remarriage because they do not want to lead a volatile life."""

According to the report, HIV positive persons among the injection drug users (IDUs) in Punjab are 21.02% against the national average of 7.2%. In Manipur, the prevalence rate is 17%. The report, which has an endorsement by Punjab's own AIDS Control Society run by the health department, says: ""Although the main HIV transmission route continues to be sexual, HIV positivity among IDUs too has emerged as a major concern for the state."" At present, there are 15,545 IDUs in Punjab. The report is based on the national sentinel surveillance data (NSSD), a wing under the Union ministry of health and family welfare. During a recent visit to Chandigarh, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi had courted controversy over his comment that seven out of 10 youths in Punjab were drug addicts. Rahul's comment had evoked sharp reactions from Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal and the state government officials. The report, however, also says that both Punjab and Manipur have shown a decline in HIV prevalence among IDUs from the previously recorded data of 26% and 25% in 2008. Between June 2007 and October 2012, 2,505 people had died due to HIV in Punjab. Alongside Gujarat and Goa, the state has also recorded the highest adult HIV prevalence at 0.32%."

However, for the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS), this was the best time to organize 10-day health camps, with HIV testing facilities, in districts which see a large population migrating to bigger cities for work. The results of the tests were an eye opener as high prevalence of HIV infection was found among the migrating population. The health department officials were shocked to find that the wives of these workers, many of them pregnant, also tested HIV positive. At least 65 cases of HIV were detected at the health camps set up in nine districts between November 1 and November 10. These districts were Ajmer, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Sriganganagar, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Pali, Sikar and Udaipur. Those who tested positive for HIV were unaware that they were being infected with the virus, which once again stresses on the need for strengthening HIV surveillance in the districts. Project director (AIDS) Dr JP Dhamija said, ""It was the best time for launching the HIV testing in nine districts as large number of out-migratory people return to their homes to celebrate Diwali. We did not force them for HIV testing but they voluntarily came at the health camps organized in the respective areas. The camps were successful as we tested 15,975 persons for HIV."" Several pregnant women were found to be infected with HIV virus. In Sikar district, a pregnant woman was immediately referred to a hospital to prevent transmission of virus to the fetus. Two more pregnant women tested positive for HIV in Nagaur. "
154,11,2012,Travel bar on HIV patients affecting global economy: UNAIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Travel-bar-on-HIV-patients-affecting-global-economy-UNAIDS/articleshow/17301168.cms,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 25 years after HIV was detected in India, travel restrictions continue to bar patients from free movement through nations. HIV-related travel restrictions at present exist in 45 countries. The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS on Tuesday, says that the effects of such restrictions are severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy. There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries — Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen. Five other countries — Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands — require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10–90 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative. Laws in 20 countries, including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait, deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV. Even in the epidemic's fourth decade globally, nearly four in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination. The number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million between 2005 and 2010. The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas. ""Those who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants' HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved by the medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as ""permanently unfit"" to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,"" the report said. India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010. In 2002, the Union health ministry had issued a notification, stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it, and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. On September 17, 2010, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) clarified that there are no travel or residency restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) coming to India. UNAIDS says that most of these restrictions were imposed in the early years of the epidemic, when little was understood about HIV prevention and effective HIV treatment did not exist. ""In 2012, governments increasingly recognize that these restrictions make no sense in a world in which HIV exists in every country, people living with HIV are living long and productive lives and equal freedom of movement is not only a human right but essential in a globalized world. Of note is the decline in the number of countries, territories and areas with HIV-related travel restrictions from 96 in 2000 to 45 in 2012,"" UNAIDS said. UNAIDS aims to eliminate these restrictions by 2015. Since 2010, Armenia, China, Fiji, Namibia, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and the US have repealed such restrictions. Where such restrictions continue to exist, other forms of HIV stigma and discrimination are usually common. The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that such entry restrictions mount pressure on people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. ""They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" WHO said."
155,11,2012,India records 25% dip in new HIV infections,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/India-records-25-dip-in-new-HIV-infections/articleshow/17301423.cms,"NEW DELHI: First the good news: globally there were more than half a million fewer AIDS-related deaths in 2011 than in 2005, with India reporting a 25% dip in the rate of new HIV infections between 2001 and 2011. But even then last year alone, 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide. Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011. Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible. In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV. In South and south-east Asia, an estimated 4 million people were living with HIV in 2011, compared to 3.7 million in 2001. The same year, new infections in children were 43% lower than in 2003, and 24% lower than 2009. However, 72% of children living with HIV do not have any access to treatment. An estimated 6.8 million people are eligible for treatment, but don't have access. These are the findings of the Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. The number of people accessing HIV treatment has increased by 63% between 2009 and 2011. In India, however, around 60% people requiring treatment are getting it. ""The pace of progress is quickening — what used to take a decade is now being achieved in 24 months,"" said Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS. ""We are scaling up faster and smarter than ever before. It is the proof that with political will and follow through we can reach our shared goals by 2015,"" he said. Gains have been made in reducing tuberculosis (TB)-related AIDS deaths in people living with HIV. In the last 24 months, a 13% decrease in TB-related AIDS deaths was observed. This accomplishment is due to record number of people with HIV/TB co-infection accessing antiretroviral treatment, which is recorded at 45%. UNAIDS also estimates that an additional 4 million discordant couples (where one partner is living with HIV) would benefit from HIV treatment to protect their partners from HIV infection. Of the 34 million people living with HIV, about half do not know their HIV status. The report states that if more people knew their status, they could come forward for HIV services. For example, South Africa increased its scale up of HIV treatment by 75% in the last two years—ensuring 1.7 million people had access to the lifesaving treatment—and new HIV infections have fallen by more than 50,000 in only two years. The report shows that a more than 50% reduction in the rate of new HIV infections has been achieved across 25 low and middle-income countries –– more than half in Africa, the region most affected by HIV. In some of the countries which have the highest HIV prevalence in the world, rates of new HIV infections have been cut dramatically since 2001 — by 73% in Malawi, Botswana (71%), Namibia (68%), Zambia (58%), Zimbabwe (50%), South Africa and Swaziland (41%). In addition to welcome results in HIV prevention, sub-Saharan Africa has reduced AIDS-related deaths by one-third in the last six years and increased the number of people on antiretroviral treatment by 59% in the last two years alone. The area where perhaps most progress is being made is in reducing new HIV infections in children. Half of the global reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children. ""It is becoming evident that achieving zero new HIV infections in children is possible,"" said Sidibé. ""I am excited that far fewer babies are being born with HIV. We are moving from despair to hope,"" he added. The report shows that antiretroviral therapy has emerged as a powerful force for saving lives. In the last 24 months the numbers of people accessing treatment has increased by 63% globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, a record 2.3 million people had access to treatment. China has increased the number of people on HIV treatment by nearly 50% in the last year alone. There were more than half a million fewer deaths in 2011 than in 2005. The largest drops in AIDS-related deaths are being seen in countries where HIV has the strongest grip. South Africa saw (100,000) fewer deaths, Zimbabwe (nearly 90,000), Kenya (71,000) and Ethiopia (48,000) than in 2005."

Officials said that an increasing awareness on the disease could be one of the reasons for rise in patients. ""We have also increased the number of Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and patients coming to these also reflect on the statistics,"" said Dr SK Binjhwar, Additional Project director, Chhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society (CSACS). Officials said the figure was low and not alarming, as it equates to a prevalence of 0.3%. At the same time, they feel that AIDS vulnerability is high in Chhattisgarh as it shares its geographical borders with Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, which are all high AIDS prevalence states. The figure is constantly rising, especially in the high-risk age group of 15-35 years, which is basically described as the productivity period, according to health officials. There are various other factors, all of which add up to bring the second-largest city, Bilaspur, to second place with 1,992 HIV positive people. Educational hub Durg-Bhilai has 1,865 patients. In Bastar, 125 people were tested positive last year, which have increased to 79 in the first half of 2012. Likewise, in Dantewada, the figure for the first half of the year has crossed last year's figure, as nine people were tested HIV positive in 2011 while 11 have already been identified this year. Overall, 606 persons are living with HIV virus in Bastar and 52 in Dantewada, according to official records."

The family, after spending nearly 20 days on the streets, were put back in their house by an NGO and the district administration. The family was evicted from their house on November 6 after a worker of an NGO, Jeevan Aadhar Community Care Centre, made it public to their neighbours that they were HIV positive. The head of the family, a mason, with his pregnant wife and four children where manhandled and thrown out of their house by neighbours. The entire family then shifted to Umaid Hospital as the woman suffered injuries and started bleeding when the neighbours pushed them out of the locality. The neighbours claimed that they would also get infected if the family continued to live there. Once out of the hospital, the family spent time wandering here and there in the city and finally made railway station their home where they were spotted by a local NGO, Jodhpur Network of People Living with AIDS. ""We initiated the efforts to rehabilitate them and brought the matter to the notice of the administration,"" said Dinesh Joshi of the NGO. On the interference of district collector Gaurav Goyal, some policemen from the concerned police station who had earlier refused to lent an ear to the woes of the family, went to the locality and warned the neighbours and re-accommodated the family in their house. ""We sent an official from social welfare department along with the police and resettled them in their house. Apart from this, we also ensured preventive action by the police against those who had thrown them out of the locality. We have also written to the State's AIDS Control Society complaining against the NGO Jeevan Aadhar Community Care Centre, whose worker made the mistake of informing about the family's HIV status to the neighbours,"" said Goyal Joshi told that the worker of the NGO, who made it public to the people, had visited the family as part of the periodic follow up of such cases. ""But it was the family, who had to suffer due to ignorance of that worker who made it public,"" said Joshi. He attributed the mistake to the lack of seriousness on the part of the NGO which did not educate the staff properly on such sensitive matter."

The organisations titled ‘Network of People and Children Living with HIV (NPCLH)’ have a seven member team; two men and five women. “Like any other organisation we are not limited to identify HIV patients and fighting for their health care issues with the government, but we also intend to strengthen the confidence among the patients to such an extent that they can lead a self-respecting life,” said Yogita, the president of the organisation. The organisation, which started two years back, was only a given legal frame-work in October this year. “NGO – Yash Foundation – that receives grant from Mahindra and Mahindra have helped and guided for four years. We realized that the lives of PCLHs can be made beautiful with medication and support and we can lead a normal life and perform all activities that others do. Now it is time for us to take it forward,” Yogita added. The HIV ‘positive’ people have already been visiting the antiretroviral therapy centres, interacting with other patients, fighting for fair treatment to the people admitted in civil hospital, tracing patients, counseling them and their relatives, providing meals for patients as well as their relatives during their stay in hospitals and providing legal aid. They are also rehabilitating people based on their qualifications and ability to work. “Today we have more than 300 positive people. Women unwilling or unable to go out and work are given the works to stitch gloves, while some others are engaged in managing files in rehabilitation centre. But there is a large numbers of positive patients who have been employed in engineering, pharmaceuticals or even other companies as well,” said Radhika, an office-bearer of the NPC. Yogita said that the organisation was planning to open a hostel for women and children primarily and even for men. There are several donors for the project, but, there is no land available yet. Ravindra Patil of the foundations said, “The concept of the support group is overwhelming and the foundation is ready to provide all the guidance necessary. However, now it has to ensure that it can sustain itself. The members are definitely capable of doing it.” "

The measure comes in the wake of a high instance of dropouts recorded at ART centres by the Karnataka State Aids Prevention Society (KSAPS). ""The amount spent on travelling to the nearest ART centre will be reimbursed to poor HIV-positive patients,"" said Manoj Kumar Tripathi, project director, KSAPS. The Society also announced a rally in the city on December 1 to mark World Aids Day. ""The rally will begin at Vidhana Soudha and end at Freedom Park. A day-long programme will focus on awareness of Aids,"" said Manoj. KSAPS also shared some statistics on the prevalence of HIV, which show a heartening decline in adult HIV cases in the state. ""The figure has gone down to 0.69% in 2010 from 1.5% in 2003-04. It has declined among young women in the 15-24 age group as well. HIV positivity in antenatal clinic attendees has also declined to 0.24%,"" said Manoj.

If the doctors are to be believed, contracting HIV is proving no obstacle for the couples who want get married and lead a normal life despite their condition. ""There are number of patients who feel stigmatized knowing that they contracted HIV somehow but we have helped a number of couples to get married and lead a comfortable life. I have helped nearly half-a-dozen HIV positive couples to tie the knot,"" Dr V.P Pandey, professor, department of medicine, Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital said. ""It is affection towards the partner which leads to marriage in such cases. One of my patients, a positive girl wanted to take the plunge despite knowing that she cannot have a baby. She didn't deter from her decision and said that nearly 15% of population does not have their own kid. She was confident that she could one or get one through IVF treatment,"" said Dr Pandey. According to the doctors, HIV positive couples have fair chances of having a normal child. With the medical treatments available and technological advancement, having a HIV negative child is possible. ""In past 7-8 years there are such medicines available, which make it possible to have a normal baby. I have seen nearly 100 couples having a normal baby in past 7-8 years,"" Dr Pandey said. The number of people getting married despite knowing they are HIV positive is even higher with the AIDS Society of India. Dr I.S Gilada, president of the society said, ""Those who are aware and know that HIV is manageable and allows for a good life expectancy through treatments do not fear about getting married. They want to live life as a normal individual and do anything for their affectionate partner."" He further added that he has arranged marriages of 19 positive couples and 50 marriages of at least one partner who is HIV positive."
162,11,2012,Global CEOs seek removal of travel ban on HIV positive people,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Global-CEOs-seek-removal-of-travel-ban-on-HIV-positive-people/articleshow/17408335.cms,"NEW DELHI: Some of the world’s most powerful CEOs have now joined hands to bring down repressive laws by around 45 countries that still deport, detain or deny entry to people solely because they are living with HIV. Days after TOI reported how 45 countries — many of them major hubs for international business -- still ban travel of HIV infected patients, more than 40 CEOs who represent nearly 2 million employees from companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Heineken, Merck, the National Basketball Association and Thomson Reuters signed an unprecedented pledge urging the repeal of laws and policies in these countries that restrict movement of HIV positive patients. The CEOs said they opposed HIV travel restrictions because they were discriminatory and because to succeed in today’s globalized economy, companies must be able to send their employees and best talent overseas, regardless of their HIV status. “It’s time to send HIV travel restrictions packing,” said Kenneth Cole, CEO of Kenneth Cole Productions. “Using our collective might, I believe we can use our influence to eliminate these discriminatory practices.” The US lifted its 22-year HIV travel ban in 2010. Other countries, including Armenia, China, Fiji, Moldova, Namibia and Ukraine have also recently removed such restrictions. “Travel restrictions on individuals with HIV are unnecessary and hinder the ability for individuals and companies to operate in a truly global workforce,” said Mark Bertolini, chairman and CEO of Aetna. Most HIV-travel restrictions were imposed by governments in the 1980s when little was known about the transmission of HIV, and treatment didn’t exist. “Since then, we’ve learned how to effectively prevent, manage and treat HIV,” UNAIDS said. “Restrictions on entry, stay and residence for people living with HIV are discriminatory and a violation of human rights,” said Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS. “Every individual should have equal access to freedom of movement. I urge all countries to remove all such restrictions based on HIV status,” he added. “HIV travel restrictions are discriminatory and bad for business,” said Chip Bergh, president of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries — Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, UAE and Yemen. Five countries -- Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands -- require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10–90 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative. Laws in 20 countries including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV. Even in the epidemic’s fourth decade globally, nearly 4 in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination. The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS, says that the effects of such restrictions are most severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy. From 2005 to 2010, the number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million. The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE – all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas. “Those who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants’ HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as permanently unfit to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,” the report said. India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010. In 2002, the health ministry had issued a notification stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. On September 17, 2010 the ministry of external affairs clarified that there were no travel or residency restrictions for people living with HIV coming to India. "
163,11,2012,HIV cases on a decline,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/HIV-cases-on-a-decline/articleshow/17425038.cms,"MANGALORE: The number of HIV positive cases is on the decline in Dakshina Kannada district for the past five years. While the district recorded 1,225 positive cases in 2007, the number has come down to 916 in 2011 and 778 in 2012. The district has one more reason to cheer. The percentage of HIV positive cases in the district is much lesser than that in Karnataka. While 0.69% of the population in the state is affected by HIV, in the district the percentage of people living with the virus is only 0.30. The national percentage is also 0.30. District AIDS control officer M Kishore Kumar told TOI that increased awareness among the public and various initiatives taken by the government has resulted in the reduction of the number of HIV positive cases. ""The Prevention of Parent to Children Transmission Programme (PCTP), which was launched in 2006, yielded considerable result. Earlier, an average of 30-40 per cent of the children born to HIV positive women used to be HIV positive. However, this has reduced to 3 - 4 per cent after PCTP was introduced. Under PCTP, Nevirapine, anti-retroviral (ART) tablets, are given to pregnant women living with HIV. Nevirapine syrup is given to new born babies,"" Dr Kishore said. The Union government has introduced another PCTP to check the transmission of HIV recently, wherein anti-retroviral medicines are administered to HIV positive women from their fourth month of pregnancy, Kishore said adding that the programme is aimed at bringing the parent to children transmission rate to zero in the district. The number of HIV positive pregnant women too has reduced considerably in the district in the past five years. While 79 out of 14,764 pregnant women tested positive in 2007, the number has decreased to 20 out of 19,515 in 2012."

The incidence is higher in men who have sex with men (MSM group or gays) and transgenders. While the incidences of HIV among gays have shot up by nearly 36% in Mumbai in the past two years, the figures in the city are equally disturbing. As per the estimates of the organization working for the people living with HIV, there is a rise of at least 10 per cent in figures in comparison to last year. ""The city is growing and so is the number of people flowing inside-out. In the urban population of age group 19-25 years, we have seen increase in number of HIV prevalence,"" said a member of community wishing anonymity who is also working for ensuring the rights of those affected with HIV/ AIDS. ""Though government boasts of many steps taken by it for curbing the virus spread, initiatives are not reaching till the grassroot level. Government has strong policies but they do not reach to the people. A large section is still unaware about the disease, protection and complications. Labour class needs to be educated more to curb its spread,"" said the member. Professor, department of medicine, Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital (MYH) Dr VP Pandey, told TOI, ""The rate of HIV infection is much higher in MSM group and transgenders. Nearly 8-10% people of the community are having HIV infection."""
165,12,2012,"HIV claimed 60,000 less lives last year in India",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-claimed-60000-less-lives-last-year-in-India/articleshow/17434033.cms,"NEW DELHI: India recorded around 60,000 fewer deaths due to HIV in 2011 compared to 2007 while the overall number of people living with HIV has fallen by almost 1.7 lakhs during the same period. There has been a 57% reduction in new HIV infections in India during the last decade with HIV prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipping to 0.27% (2011) compared to 0.33% (2007). The total number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in India is estimated at 21 lakhs last year. Children (below 15 years) account for 7% of all infections, and 86% are in the 15-49 age bracket. Worryingly, of all the HIV infections, 39% (8.16 lakhs) are among women, most of whom being housewives. The new HIV estimated released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday – on the eve of the World AIDS Day — says that around 1.16 lakh new HIV infections among adults and around 14,500 new infections among children had occurred last year. Of the 1.16 lakh estimated new infections in 2011 among adults, the six high-prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur and Nagaland accounted for 31% of new infections. Considerable declines in HIV prevalence have been recorded among female sex workers at national level (5.06% in 2007 to 2.67% in 2011) and in most of the states, where long-standing targeted interventions have focused on behaviour change and increase in condom use. Declines have been achieved among men who have sex with men (7.41% in 2007 to 4.43% in 2011) also, though several pockets in the country show higher HIV prevalence among them with mixed results. Reduction in HIV cases among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) at the national level haven’t been significant (7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011). Besides north-eastern states where declines have been achieved, newer pockets of high HIV prevalence among IDUs have emerged over the last few years, mainly in states like Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai, Kerala, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The report says that scale up of free anti retroviral treatment (ART) since 2004 has saved over 1.5 lakh lives till last year. At the current pace of scale up of ART services, it is estimated to avert around 50,000–60,000 deaths annually in the next five years. Azad told TOI, “India’s progress in controlling the deadly virus has been remarkable. China, India and South Africa are the only three countries which have witnessed a fall in new HIV cases by over 50%. The recent UN general assembly on HIV unanimously hailed these countries for such progress.” In 2011, among the states, Manipur has shown the highest estimated adult HIV prevalence of 1.22%, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.75%), Mizoram (0.74%), Nagaland (0.73%), Karnataka (0.52%), Goa (0.43%) and Maharashtra (0.42%). Besides these, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Chandigarh have shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence at 0.27%. The study said, “The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2001 through 0.35% in 2006 to 0.27% in 2011. Similar consistent declines are noted among both males and females at national level.” About 1.48 lakh people died of AIDS-related causes in India last year. Deaths among HIV infected children account for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. Wider access to ART has led to 29% reduction in estimated annual AIDS-related deaths during NACP-III period (2007-2011). Thanks to fall in India’s HIV numbers, south-east Asia (11 countries, including India) has seen a 35% dip in new HIV infections, from 3.2 lakhs (2001) to 2.08 lakhs (2011). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the HIV epidemic is clearly reversing. In 2011, 2.2 million people across the world were infected with HIV and 1.7 million died, half a million fewer new infections than 10 years ago, and 6 lakhs fewer deaths than 2005. However, the global health watch dog said the region also faces serious challenges. In the region, 46% of adults in need of treatment were enrolled in care and treatment by the end of 2011 – up from 12% in 2005. The coverage for HIV treatment in children is 39% in 2011 – up from 9% in 2005. Starting treatment early reduces morbidity and mortality due to HIV, and recent studies have also confirmed the prevention benefits of early treatment in uninfected regular sexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. “The overall decline in the region is cause for increased optimism, however complacency now could become our greatest enemy,” said Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, regional director of WHO south-east Asia. “Those most vulnerable to HIV are also among the least empowered and HIV prevention care and treatment services for these people need to be made available and accessible,” he added.

Statistics of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) show 14 persons contracted the virus up to October this year as against four persons in the corresponding period last year; a rise of over 300%. The state's apex body for control of HIV/AIDS in Goa, incidentally, doesn't receive data of blood tests done at private laboratories, so the numbers-including the overall for the state-could be higher, said officials. The only other taluka to see a rise in HIV numbers this year is Ponda-two up from 26 recorded last year. Most of the other 11 talukas have seen declines. Commenting on Canacona's rise in numbers, GSACS project director Dr Rajananda Desai said the tourist-centric beaches in the taluka-Palolem and Galgibaga-could have contributed to the overall numbers. The coastal belts of the state have always been considered very vulnerable to the virus. Remarkable declines in numbers were recorded in Salcete (52; down 34 from last year's 86), Mormugao (77; down 37 from last year's 114), Tiswadi (33; down 26 from 59), Quepem (10; down nine from 19) and Pernem (4; down seven from 11). Dips were also seen in Bicholim (14; down four from last year's 18), Sanguem (12; down four from 16) and Sattari (14; down one from 15). GSACS' statistics also show an increase in the number of those who succumbed to full-blown AIDS this year. Eighty-one persons-57 men, 23 women and a transgender person-succumbed to AIDS between January and September 2012 as against 90 who died between January and December 2011. Commenting on this, Desai said, ""HIV takes several years to turn into full-blown AIDS. Those who died would have contracted the virus seven to eight years ago."" She added that up to October this year 486 people have tested positive for HIV, while 76 are currently living with AIDS. Desai stressed that HIV cases have been on a decline in Goa for the last four years. While around 1,019 persons contracted the virus in 2008, the numbers dropped to 959 in 2009, 821 in 2010 and 665 in 2011. Of these 105 HIV-infected persons developed AIDS in 2008, 184 in 2009, 154 in 2010 and 106 in 2011. Stating that GSACS has so far tested the blood samples of just 3,62,414 people for HIV (the state's population is over 15 lakh), the project director said there could be more people with HIV in Goa. ""We work with high-risk groups that include commercial sex workers, and men who have sex with men. While most have tested for the virus, there may be some who have not come forward to test themselves,"" said Desai. She added, ""Besides, there may be some people who have done their blood tests at private laboratories. These laboratories do not provide their data to GSACS and their figures are therefore not on record."""

It is also among the six states that together account for 41% of new HIV infections. A March 2012 report by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) revealed that Surat and Ahmedabad are the two districts with the highest density of people undergoing anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and those detected as HIV positive. The data shows 1,012 patients were added to the HIV list in Gujarat as reported by government and NGO-run dispensaries. A total of 25,885 patients are undergoing ART in the state. Further, the number of children and adults undergoing ART doubled between January 2010 and 2012. Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) officials said this was because of increased surveillance and more nodal centres. Last year, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Chandigarh showed an estimated adult HIV prevalence of 0.31%, which was greater than national figure of 0.27%. Manipur had the highest HIV prevalence of 1.22%, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.75%), Mizoram (0.74%), Nagaland (0.73%), Karnataka (0.52%), Goa (0.43%) and Maharashtra (0.42%). GSACS figures show 5.85 lakh patients in the state were detected with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), of which 1,012 patients were HIV positive. Umesh Oza, in-charge project director of AMC Aids Control Society (ACS) said, ""Our pre-natal intervention with women patients is proving fruitful. Of 23,582 mothers tested, 60 women tested positive for HIV. Of these we found 52 HIV positive deliveries.(With inputs from Sushmita Digar)"
168,12,2012,World AIDS Day: Maharashtra in bottom half of HIV report card,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/World-AIDS-Day-Maharashtra-in-bottom-half-of-HIV-report-card/articleshow/17434734.cms,"MUMBAI: HIV/AIDS claimed 60,000 fewer lives in 2010-11 than two years ago and the national average showed a healthy decline in the percentage of people testing positive for the virus, but Maharashtra maintained its position as a high-risk state ranking among the bottom five on several counts. The new HIV estimates released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on the eve of World AIDS Day show Maharashtra remains a hotbed for HIV infection among high-risk groups and the prevalence rate is much higher than the national average. According to the recently concluded HIV Sentinel Surveillance 2010-11, national prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipped to 0.27% but the positivity in the state hovered around 0.42%. In fact, Maharashtra, with six other states, accounted for 31% new infections in the two years since the previous study. Agencies working for HIV prevention in the state attributed the high prevalence to migration. Project director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) Ramesh Devkar said: “While more people are approaching care centres, migration is one of the main causes why we continue to remain a hotbed.” The state has come off as the worst for HIV among female sex workers (FSW) with prevalence at 6.89% against a national average of 2.67%. Devkar pointed out that prevalence was around 11% two years ago, arguing that the state is improving. His biggest worry remains HIV prevalence among men having sex with men (MSM) and intravenous drug users (IDU). The national average for MSM is 4.43% but it’s almost a steep 10% in the state. Experts say Mumbai plays a huge role. Though there is no official confirmation, the prevalence of HIV among MSM in the city is believed to be above 12%. Worse, among transgenders, the prevalence stands at an astounding 18.80%. For intravenous drug users, the state average for HIV/AIDS prevalence stood at 14.17%, double the national average of 7.14%. Overall, reduction in HIV cases among IDUs at the national level has not been significant. It has dipped from 7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011. In the HSS study, Mumbai surprisingly emerged as one of the areas with high prevalence of HIV among truckers. While Gujarat’s Kutch topped the list with 8.1% prevalence, Mumbai appeared among the hotspots with an average of 1.2%, along with Nagpur 2% from the state. The total number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in India is estimated at 21 lakh last year with the state accounting for over 4.20 lakh cases. Around 1,243 people have succumbed to AIDS in the state this year till October."

But while most AIDS patients see death staring at them, this gutsy 40-year-old woman and her 15-year-old son have refused to let the demon run havoc in their life. Aruna Sarkar's husband Sujoy committed suicide in 1999, unable to come to terms with the fact that he was HIV positive. By then he had already passed on the virus to Aruna and the couple's only son Debaditya. On World AIDS day the mother-son duo prays that no one in this world gets infected for no fault of theirs. Everything looked rosy for Aruna and Sujoy when they tied the knot in 1996. A few months later Sujoy left for Mumbai to work as radio officer with an oil major. He would come back to stay with his family in their Salt Lake house during leaves. It was during such trips home that his family noticed him falling ill often. Though Sujoy had got his HIV status detected in Mumbai, he did not dare share it with any of his family members, not even his wife. ""My husband probably could not accept that fact that he had the virus. In addition the guilt that he might have infected me and my son probably led him to commit suicide in July 1999. My son was a little less than two years then,"" Aruna recounted. There was worse to come. Sujoy's parents blamed Aruna for his HIV status and consequent suicide. She and the toddler were thrown out of the house. With advice from doctors, the mother-son got themselves checked and found that they were both infected. Since then they have been living with Aruna's parents in Baguiati. ""My world came crumbling down for the second time when we both tested positive for HIV. My son became really ill in 2004. But Dr Subhashis Bhattacharya, who works at the apex clinic in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, came as a godsend. He not only helped us with the treatment but supported us mentally through counseling. He made us believe that AIDS is not the end of the world,"" Aruna told TOI. Aruna's elder brother and parents stood rock solid behind her. Aruna, who is a science graduate, gives private tuition to fund his son's education. Debaditya is preparing for his Class X board examination. ""I am very positive about life. Come what may, I do not let HIV affect my life. But I do not want my friends to come to know about it as the infection is still a taboo for many. I only wish no one gets the infection for none of their fault,"" Debaditya said. ""The amount of grit and courage Aruna has is incredible. In spite of being HIV-positive, she is not only bringing up her HIV-positive son single-handedly, but is also ensuring good education for him,"" said Dr Bhattacharya, a paediatric HIV specialist with NACO. Aruna and Debaditya are getting their anti-retroviral therapy free of cost, but she is concerned for her son's future. Often she has to seek financial help from NGOs for his education. ""The expenses of my son's education will only grow as he graduates into higher class. My earning through private tuitions is too meagre and irregular at times. I want a job but I do not know who would offer me one. Also will any organisation give me a job if they know my HIV status?"" wondered Aruna. While teaching the chapter on HIV in biology Aruna does not forget to tell her students never to indulge in unprotected sex. ""I make it a point to stress upon the fact that none should have unprotected sex as it is a major source for HIV transmission. I do not want anyone to undergo the hardship I am going through. I can fight but not everyone might have the strength to do so,"" she added. (Names of the HIV-positive persons changed in order to protect their identity)"

The mom-to-be, who hails from the Old Town area, discovered to her horror that she had tested positive for HIV/AIDS. What unfolded thereafter was nothing short of a tragedy. The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth. Her husband Raju (name changed), whom she married in 2008 and was one who allegedly passed on the infection to her, died a few months ago because of infections generally associated with the disease. Now Sujatha's family members have lodged a police complaint with the One Town police station against Raju's family, alleging that he deliberately hid his HIV status at the time of marriage and infected an innocent woman. They are demanding that Raju's family bear the cost of Sujata's treatment, as she hails from a not so well-to-do family. ""She is on ARV (anti-retroviral drugs) and her monthly medicine bill alone comes to about Rs 3000. The drugs along with other medicines and nutritional food are very costly. She was infected by her husband and now it is their turn to take care of her,"" her mother Savitri said. Similar cases of persons getting married without disclosing his or her health status are on the rise. Recently, another such case came to light in a very well-known and affluent family. Luckily the bride's parents came to know about the groom's HIV positive status on the wedding morning and demanded he undergo a medical test due to which he was caught, says Dr Kutikuppla Surya Rao, a doctor who has been treating HIV/AIDS affected since the last two decades. But most cases do not come to light due to the stigma attached to the disease. In fact, police officials at One Town station admitted that Sujata's was the first such case to be lodged with them. ""We are aware of such things and will not hesitate to book a case but most people do not come forward as stigma of being HIV/AIDS positive still prevails. Things can change only when people come out of their shell and lodge a complaint,"" said an official of One Town police station. For several years, this has been the subject of a raging debate - should both the bride and the groom be made to undergo HIV/AIDS test before marriage? ""This issue was first raised at a NACO summit chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2001. The discussion then moved to Parliament but never translated into an Act or rule. It has been watered down to the level that if an innocent woman or man is infected by his or her partner, then he or she can lodge a complaint in the police station or file a case for compensation or treatment charges. But that is not sufficient in the present condition,"" pointed out Dr Surya Rao. The medical practitioner says that such cases have been on the rise and he has seen about 30 to 40 such cases in the last two years. ""In a majority of the cases, it has been men infecting women, with just a few stray cases the other way around. And 80 per cent of them were aware of their HIV status. Being aware and then getting married is a crime. Though 2012 is considered to be a path breaking year for HIV/AIDS research as the treatment is moving from prevention phase to cure status, it is still a crime to infect another purposefully. There is, however, no problem if two positive persons get married,"" he said. Though as per a NACO report the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is on the decline, Dr G Prabhakar of Green Vision pointed out that the decline was being witnessed in high risk group such as commercial sex workers (CSWs), truckers and migrant workers. ""The worrying factor is that the growing promiscuity among youth has led to an upswing in the incidence of the disease in the middle and affluent classes. Though there is no survey to establish this fact, as a medical practitioner actively involved in this segment, I think there has been a growth of at least 10 per cent over the last decade,"" said Dr Prabhakar.Host of awareness programmes today On the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday, the Port City is hosting a number of awareness programmes in tune with this year's theme of 'Getting to zero'. As per the theme, the aim is to achieve zero figure in various areas such as - new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths' for period 2011-15. Addressing the media here on Friday, additional district medical health officer (AIDS and Leprosy) Ronanki Ramesh said that AP has around five lakh HIV positive persons, of which 5.78 per cent are from Vizag district alone. Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a medical practitioner, who had been treating the HIV/AIDS-infected and affected in the city, said the focus this time was on the student community to raise awareness levels as education plays a vital role in creating awareness. As part of this, a first of its kind human AIDS red ribbon chain would be formed at the campus of Government College for Women at 10 am on Saturday. Apart from this, a 40 feet high burning red ribbon would be displayed there. Meanwhile, the district medical, health and family welfare department in collaboration with the Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is also organising a rally at 9 am from GVMC to Jagadamba on the occasion. Around 500 nursing students are expected to participate in the rally apart from female sex workers. ""A public meeting will also be held from 10.30 am and will be addressed by the district collector and chairman of district AIDS Prevention and Control Committee V Seshadri in the presence of GVMC commissioner,"" Ramesh said.

The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the seven coastal districts combined is 0.81 per cent, which is more than the state average of 0.77 per cent. As per AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) data, the highest prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is in Kadapa (2.25 %), followed by the coastal district of East Godavari (1.25 per cent). In Krishna (1 %), Guntur (1.08 %) and West Godavari it is close to the state average. Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are however a little lower than the state average. Project director of APSACS C Partha Sarathi said, ""We have given special focus on prevention of new infections from pregnant women to newborns during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The vertical (mother to child) transmission rate without any medication is around 30 per cent. During the last National Aids Control Programme (NACP), we were able to bring down this transmission rate to about 10 per cent with single dose Nevirapine prophylaxis in the mother-baby pairs. But AP is now piloting the superior triple drug regime, which aims at bringing down the HIV infection in newborns to around three per cent."" Recently, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka launched the PPTCT (prevention of parent to child transmission) 'triple drug regimen'. ""There will be a paradigm shift with the triple-drug regimen. The state is now looking forward to bringing down the mother-to-child transmission to zero,"" said state epidemiologist K Jaya Krishna and deputy director (monitoring, evaluation and surveillance), APSACS. Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy), Visakhapatnam, said, ""Around 85 per cent of HIV transmission happens due to unsafe sex, while around 15 per cent is passed on from the pregnant mother to the child. It's now possible to stop vertical transmission by 98 per cent with the use of a combination of three ARV drugs starting from 14 weeks of pregnancy irrespective of CD4 count till the end of breastfeeding that is up to one or one and a half years. Soon after delivery, the infant will be given Nevarapine syrup for six weeks to be followed up for DBS-PCR tests till 18 months. The triple drug regimen under Mamta Plus programme also spikes the risk of drug resistance,"" he stated. AP is planning to give special importance to counselling and testing programme in the coming year and has set a target for 35 lakh tests (including 15 lakhs pregnant women). Overall, according to APSACS, new infections are on the decline in the state with an approximately 23 per cent decline in new infections being recorded in 2009 in comparison to 2006. ANC prevalence dropped down to less than 1% (0.77%) for the first time in 2010, as per the latest survey. "
172,12,2012,HIV testing facilities to come up all across state: Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/HIV-testing-facilities-to-come-up-all-across-state-Rajasthan-State-AIDS-Control-Society/articleshow/17435803.cms," JAIPUR: The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) is expanding its HIV testing facility up to the block level since the entire state is vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Earlier, the HIV testing facilities were available at all government medical colleges, district hospitals and community heath centres of seven high risk districts. Now, RSACS has decided not to keep confine the HIV testing facilities at high risk districts but also to expand it to other districts as well. ""Rajasthan has a special situation in terms of equal HIV prevalence rates of both urban and rural areas,"" an RSACS official said. The official said already 182 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) are in the state. However, majority of the ICTCs were located at seven districts - Jaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Tonk, Udaipur, Barmar and Sriganganagar. Except in these seven districts, the other districts lack testing centres. The HIV testing in private hospitals is costly but at the government's centres, it is free of cost, the official said, adding that expanding the testing facility would strengthen healthcare facilities in the state. Apart from 182, another 282 more testing centres would be opened in the state with help from the staff of the community health centres (CHC). The RSACS would provide HIV testing kits to the CHCs. Trained counselors would be posted at the CHCs and would counsel people coming to the centre for HIV testing. For the purpose, the RSACS would provide training to National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) employees deployed at the CHCs. The RSACS data show that till January of the financial year 2010-11, altogether 1.92 lakh general clients were counseled, 1.87 lakh tested and 6,417 persons tested positive for the HIV. The new ICTC would impart information people about HIV prevention, counsels them to undergo testing, provides testing facilities and also links positive people with treatment, care and support system, the RSACS said. The society further said HIV testing facilities help in identifying new HIV positive cases and provide the new cases a quality of life by linking them with support and care."

As things turned out, she got married and got infected. The husband is no more but there’s her, two children and the virus. In a country where people living with AIDS are still subjected to ostracism, a lone HIV positive woman with two children did not really stand a chance. But there is something to be said about sheer grit. If you have it, even gunny bags can give you a lease of life. In Sangeeta’s case, the gunny bags came with something even more precious – dignity. The feisty lady has received a bulk contract from a Kalka-based company to sew gunny bags for Rs 4,000 month. On World Aids Day, nine women living with AIDS joined her to make a living sewing gunny bags. She calls women living with AIDS on her mobile phone. One, she proudly points out, she bought herself. At 31, Saumya is treading the same path. Like Sangeeta, Saumya lost her husband, who was HIV positive. Unlike Sangeeta, the legacy she received included not only HIV but also TB. It was not possible for her to work anywhere till people from the drop-in-centre approached her to help her earn by stitching gunny bags. She is also trying to reach out to women deprived of care when they need it the most. “I have seen the vicissitudes of life and I am trying to guide women suffering the same way,” she said. It was Archana, in-charge of the drop-in-centre who conceived the idea of helping women with the craft of making polybags. Archana, who lives with AIDS herself, plans to expand operations to include more women in the ambit of the self-sustaining group. “We went to Anandpur Sahib a few days ago where we saw women working on recycled paper for a well known company. Though the marketing was not impressive, it generated Rs 1,500 per month. We decided to modify the concept and raise income for the women,” she said. While the centre has a special machine to imprint the names that buyers want, they also plan to buy a machine which can be used to make disposable cups and glasses. “With these self employment schemes, we will expand services to all 100 women living with HIV in the city,” said Archana.

SACS data reveals that the prevalence of HIV in Chandigarh has dropped from .25% to .23% of the total city’s population this year. Experts attribute the decline to increasing awareness and effective reaching out to high risk groups. However, the city remains in Category B, the same as Mumbai. This year’s theme of World AIDS Day is “Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths”. According to the latest figures of UNAIDS, 2.4 million people in the country are living with HIV. The prevalence rate nationally is 0.3% of the population. SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta said, “Out of the 21,120 pregnant women tested since 2008, 42 have tested positive. The number has reduced as there were 60 positives in 2008. However, the city comes under category B of HIV/AIDS due to injectable drug users, which is high in adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana.” Meanwhile, the new case detection rate among walk-in voluntary testing of public in the ICTC centres of Chandigarh has declined from 7.1% in 2008 to 2.19% in 2012. This year the SACS has been sanctioned to start two more oral substitution therapy centres in the city to gradually wean off injectable drug users to oral therapy. “We already have eight such centres,” revealed the director. The SACS has plans to rope in college and university students for spreading the message of prevention against HIV. “We have been working with the ITBP and will be sensitizing defence personnel also,” said Dr Gupta.

However, the city still tops for being the maximum HIV infected population in the state. The number of people found with HIV infection has come down over the past two years. The official figures of the MP State Aids Control Society (MPSACS) substantiate the fact. Indore has the maximum number of 7200 HIV positive patients as of October 2012, which was 6305 last year. If the studies of health department in Indore are anything to go by, the rate of HIV positive patients has dropped down to 2.7% in 2012 till October last, which was 6.9% in 2010. The department this year has screened 25,244 people and found 703 positive patients. Last year, 18,213 people were screened and 875 were identified positive. District Nodal Officer, Dr Vijay Chajjlani said, ""People are more aware about the disease and its complications. With rising awareness more number of people are approaching for health check-up and are not hesitating to ask about the diseases and the precautionary steps to avoid the same."" The number of positive cases in pregnant women has also gone down over the past years. The department screened 24,875 women and found only 39 positive cases in 2012 while last year 56 pregnant women were identified positive. As per the comparative figures the positive percentage is 0.15% in the city, which was 0.24% last year.

The provision of concession was introduced by the state government so that the people living with HIV/AIDS would not have to spend on fares to get medicines for HIV/AIDS, which is being provided by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society free of cost from the ART centers. However, many HIV/AIDS patients claimed they have to face problems in availing the concession. ""The bus conductor demands the pass issued by RSRTC. Since the passes refer to the holder as immunocompromised, some conductors ask us many questions about medicines and ART centers, which lead to disclosure of our HIV status,"" Sangeeta (name changed), an HIV positive woman said.

The city is emerging as a new ground for HIV infections caused by intravenous drug abuse. Director, centre of excellence, National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), Banaras Hindu University, Shyam Sundar said HIV infection is a common trend in north eastern states specially Manipur, but the trend is now seen in Varanasi as well. “At present around 10 HIV patients are being treated in the ART centre, BHU. They are not backpackers or foreigners but natives of the city, who are youngsters and middle-aged people. Such drug abusers are often seen at ghats and older parts of the city. Mass sharing of the syringe and needle is often a common practice by drug abusers that invites HIV infection. The trend is catching fast which is very unlikely for a city like Varanasi,” Sunder added. The officials of NACO, Varanasi, stated that the entire eastern UP area is turning out to be a highly sensitive zone for HIV infections because of migration from rural to urban slum areas and even metropolitan cities. Jaunpur, Azamgarh and Ghazipur are identified as the highly sensitive districts. Varanasi ranks at number four. Most of these patients are in the age group of 20 to 45 years and bread winners for the families. Almost 90 per cent of the patients belong to lower middle class families and have poor economic conditions. Recently, new ART centres (for first line treatment) have been opened in Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Jaunpur and the district hospital in Varanasi but the region’s vulnerability towards the HIV infection is not decreasing the number of patients at ART centre, BHU. Around 300 to 350 patients are arriving at the centre every day. NACO nodal centre in BHU is also the ART centre which was formed in 2005. Already emerged as centre of excellence along with only three other ART centres in northern India, it is providing qualitative first line and second line treatment for AIDS. Apart from screening and treatment of HIV patients, the centre boasts of other facilities like integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC), Suraksha Clinic (STD clinic) and counselling centre for prevention of parent to child transmission (PPCTC). “At present, as many as 15,819 HIV positive patients are registered in the centre. Earlier low turnout of HIV positive people coming for screening and treatment at the centre was troubling the experts, but now we are overcoming this problem by identifying people and arranging meeting with ICTC and other centres. Around 80 per cent of patients are now turning up for treatment,” Sunder added. "

Ranjan, who is in jail since November 14, is said to have been arrested for demanding adequate allocation of drugs at the 10 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres in the state. The demonstrators claimed that the ART centres lacked sufficient doctors. They accused the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) of ill-treating the HIV positive people. There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 55,000 are HIV positive. The largest numbers of HIV positive people are in Patna district. There are 207 integrated counselling and testing centres where people are tested for HIV and counselled accordingly. Bihar has sought help from the Centre for making arrangements for HIV/AIDS tests at every health centre across the state. BNP+ members from UP, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan participated in the demonstration. Supreme Court lawyer Anand Grover termed the arrest of Ranjan a clear violation of fundamental rights to speech. ""Continued denial of basic medicines and services to HIV positive people is a denial of the fundamental rights to them,"" said Manoj Pardeshi from New Delhi. Secretary, BNP+, Raj Kumar Singh said not only doctors do not come to the ART centres, even basic paediatric medicines are not available for the children found HIV positive. Sunita from Muzaffarpur said she has to travel 35kms to the ART centre for drug. She complained that drug is available only after 4-5 days of her visit. ""How can I manage with this,"" she said. Naresh Yadav of International treatment preparedness coalition of India (ITPC-India), New Delhi, said Ranjan's arrest speaks of Emergency-like situation where the government wants to suppress all the dissenting voice. This is happening in the backdrop of the state government's announcement of a slew of measures for people with HIV\AIDS in the state which include starting pension scheme for them and providing employment. Pension scheme was announced by deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi while inaugurating an awareness exhibition on HIV/AIDS on the Red Ribbon Express, in Patna, in September this year. The government feels grant of pension will embolden people living with AIDS or HIV positive."

The condition of such patients, who stop responding to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), continues to deteriorate despite restarting earlier medication. So, they need to be put on the second line of ART treatment. “We keep telling patients at every visit not to miss medicines. But some of them do land up with first line failure and have to be put on second line. GMCH started this facility last year. The viral load in these patients is extremely high. We identify them, send them to Mumbai to assess viral load, and if they need second line ART, they are put on it immediately,” said professor and head of medicine at GMCH Dr YB Bansod. Second line of ART is available at only five centres in the state, at the government medical colleges in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Sangli. Till October this year, total 1,546 patients were on second line. City has second line ART centre at GMCH, where 144 patients; 124 men, 17 women and 3 children, are being treated. Patients say that lack of awareness, carelessness, casual attitude and poverty play a big role in the discontinuation of medicine, leading to second line treatment. Kalabai was told of her positive status during pregnancy tests at GMCH. Since she was put on mother to child prevention drugs, her son is negative. Being poor, she had taken shelter in a missionary ashram for some time, and has now left her son there to study. Others on second line have similar experiences. Sunita from Yavatmal was accompanying her husband who is on second line. “I didn’t feed my daughter . I am also positive, but my daughter is not. I work as a maid to keep the family going since my husband gave up his job as a driver. He caught HIV from sexual relationships while away on the job,” she said in a choked voice. Surekha (51) from Umrer tested positive only after her husband died, and is now on second line. Her two grown up sons take care of her. Ramratan, from a village near Pandhurna, admits he had sexual relations with CSWs, which led to the HIV. “Now, I have no means of earning my daily bread. My brother supports me with food and travel charges,” he said. Subhash from Jharkhand, now a resident of Nagpur, too admits he had multiple sexual partners while working as a driver. Put on second line about four months back, he has brought his family to Nagpur and told his wife and children about having tested positive for HIV. Surprisingly, Sanjiv Waghmare, a sanitary worker, claims that he never missed his medicine, and yet landed up with failure of first line. “I had an alarm in the mobile and would stop anywhere to take the medicine when it rang. God knows why I still developed resistance,” he said. "

From 23,905 infections reported during 2009, the number of new infections dipped to 16,603 during 2011, which is a rare good sign, but overall the caseload was still highest with 3.61 lakh to 4.88 lakh cases. The Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (APSACS) officials released the latest NACO report at a massive programme organised at NTR Stadium in the city on Saturday. The programme was attended by a whopping 15,000 people including members of various NGOs working with APSACS, link workers, students, NSS cadets among others. The programme was preceded by a 3-km long rally from Sundaraiah Vignana Kendram to NTR Stadium with 10,000 participants. Men and women sporting red ribbons marched silently showing placards bearing messages on safe sex and urging people to stay away from drugs. APSACS officials said that while 5,000 participants in the rally were from Hyderabad, the rest had come from various parts of the state. All the participants took a pledge to strive for zero HIV new infections and zero stigma discrimination. "
183,12,2012,Zero discrimination against HIV positive patients an unrealistic target: Ghulam Nabi Azad,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Zero-discrimination-against-HIV-positive-patients-an-unrealistic-target-Ghulam-Nabi-Azad/articleshow/17446446.cms,"NEW DELHI: “Getting to Zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero deaths from AIDS-related illness. Zero discrimination” may have been the theme of the World AIDS Day on Saturday. But for Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, it’s an unreachable target in the near future. He has strongly contradicted the global theme. The minister told TOI “in no way can India achieve such a target in the near future. In fact no country can do so.” “Zero discrimination”, according to him, is a far cry. On Friday, Azad told Parliament that discrimination is rampant in India. The minister said the operational guidelines for ART services clearly mention that “irrespective of HIV status of a person, all patients are entitled to receive general and special out patient and inpatient services in a hospital.” He added that “confidentiality should be maintained at all levels irrespective of HIV status as per medical ethics and the law.” But he admitted that cases of discrimination “are reported from time to time”. According to him, in the last three years, 21 cases of discrimination have been reported – nine from Karnataka, Delhi (4), Madhya Pradesh (3), Bihar (2) and Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Odisha (1 each). Around 11 cases of suicides by HIV/AIDS patients have also been reported during the same time – 6 from Karnataka, Gujarat (3) and Delhi and Tamil Nadu (1 each) to the state grievance redressal committees. North Indian states, he felt, need to follow the example of their southern counterparts in controlling HIV. “North India has been slow to address the HIV threat. Southern states have done better,” said Azad. New HIV infections in children are down, but reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation requires that more HIV+ pregnant women receive antiretroviral treatment to decrease the risk of infection for their babies, said Unicef on Saturday. In India over 14,000 children got infected last year — a 13% decline from 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 age group) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011. The total number of people living with HIV in the country has seen a decline from approximately 2.3 million to 2.1 million. The drop has been much higher among men (16%) than women (2.6%). “Thanks to remarkable global commitment, the world has seen a 24% reduction in new HIV infections in children – from 430,000 in 2009 to 330,000 in 2011. Much progress has been made in the field of treatment. In low and middle-income countries, coverage of effective antiretroviral treatment for preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) reached 57% in 2011,” Unicef added. Regarding access to treatment of children in need, it increased from 6% in 2006, when the pediatric HIV programme was launched in India to 34% last year. “It is simply wrong that adults are twice as likely as children to receive the treatment they need,” said Anthony Lake, executive director of Unicef. “By definition, an AIDS-free generation depends on protecting the youngest and most vulnerable from HIV infection. We must do still more to help mothers and children who live with HIV be able to live free from AIDS. We must rededicate ourselves to boosting the number of pregnant women and children being tested and treated through basic antenatal and child health programmes,” he added. "

Amritsar has clearly emerged to be the HIV capital of Punjab with not just the highest number of HIV positive people but also the highest number of deaths due to the deadly disease. Till last year, 1,325 people had died of HIV in the state but in the past 12 months there have been over 1,200 deaths taking the toll up to 2,505 till October this year. This translates into nearly 100 deaths every month across the state. In Amritsar alone, 286 people, who were on treatment for HIV succumbed to the disease while neighboring Tarn Taran reported second highest deaths, 278, during the year. It is estimated that the death rate has increased owing to phenomenal growth in the number of drug abusers sharing needles. "

She was pregnant when she found out that her husband was HIV positive and had concealed the information from her. Betrayed, she came back. The bigger shock came when pregnancy tests revealed that her husband had passed the virus on to her. ""I had seen my husband remain ill all the time because of HIV. When I came to India, I consulted a doctor who put me on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) right away and asked me to have a nutritious diet. I made it my mantra. Except for normal coughs and colds, which normal people suffer during changes of season, I have not remained ill,"" says Manisha. Manisha says her good health prompted her to start a beauty parlour in partnership with her best friend. ""I feel very energetic and have never felt sick. My attitude towards HIV has changed through my own experience"", says Manisha. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel, who was one of the first private practitioners to dedicate himself to treating HIV, says viral load becomes undetectable in patients on ART therapy after just six months of treatment. ""With this treatment, only the diagnostic test tells if a person is HIV positive. Otherwise, viral load becomes undetectable in the blood,"" says Dr Patel. ""I have a number of patients who have been treated for the last 10 years and a few have lived for more than 12-14 years! My oldest patient is a 96-year old gentleman who has been living healthily with HIV for 12 years,"" says Dr Patel. He says that most patients who have done well have followed their treatments well, have paid attention to what they eat, and more importantly, have had good family support. ""Good family support somehow adds years and cuts down the illness"", says Dr Patel. Ahmedabad: When you first meet Manoj Parmar, 31, he appears healthy, with a wide, infectious smile. His story touches people deeply. Manoj has been battling HIV for nine years. He was diagnosed with the virus in 2003. Scared and shocked, he was left with no option but to keep this news to himself. After three years of struggle, in 2006, he came out and shared the news with his family. ""I was helpless and didn't know who to turn to for advice. Those three years were the hardest for me since there were no medicines available for treatment at that time,"" he says. His suffering motivated and inspired him to become a counselor in the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI). Now he counsels people suffering from HIV and AIDS. He is one of the few people who is an HIV patient as well as a HIV counsellor. ""The most vital aspect for an AIDS patient is that they should take great care that the disease does not spread to another person. My wife is also an HIV positive patient, but we take full preventive measures."" In fact, the couple was living such a normal life that they felt confident adopting the girl child from their wife's first marriage. ""I am very lucky to get moral and emotional support from my family and friends. Their acceptance level has motivated me to live a normal life without any shame or guilt. I believe that my behavior is important, not status. Live till you die, is what I tell all my patients in my counseling sessions."" ""Whether it's an accident or a deadly disease like AIDS, one should live life happily and healthily. Exercise regularly, do yoga, eat nutritious food and create a positive environment. Also emotional and mental support from those close to us is necessary to live a good, positive life. AIDS patients are just like normal people and one should not discriminate against them,"" he concludes."

Narrating the problems they faced, several participants at the programme revealed that support from family and friends was most important for HIV/AIDS infected to lead a normal life. Like 28-year-old Vijayalakshmi (name changed), who talked about how her first instinct, when she tested HIV positive in 2005, was to hide the test results from her family as she realised her husband had passed on the disease. However, after her husband passed away, she disclosed her medical condition to her family and is today, leading a normal life thanks to their support. “My family members supported me in my treatment. At present, I am not taking any medicines as I have recuperated and am able to lead a normal life,” she said. Dr G Prabhakar, director, Green Vision, said, “Assurance, medical treatment and nutrition are the key to treating HIV positive patients.” Emphasising the need for regular counseling sessions, Prabhakar said HIV can be passed in three ways - sexual contact, using unsterilised needles and syringes and mother-to-child transmission. He said 90 per cent of HIV positive cases can be prevented from spreading if detected at an early stage and stressed on the need to continue with prevention and caring support programme. Dr Ramesh, additional district medical health officer, said HIV positive patients are similar to those affected by diabetes or hypertension. He said they need to have a positive frame of mind and involve themselves in physical activities such as walking and gymming to stay healthy. K S Chalam, special rapporteur, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), said south India is in the limelight for a large number of cases detected. “That does not mean that HIV positive cases are less in north India. Cases have been detected largely in south India due to the reach of medical treatment to remote corners.” "

According to data available with the state AIDS control society (SACS), 35 of a total of 38 babies born to HIV positive parents this year were without any trace of the disease. These figures look encouraging as last year 70 of the 82 babies born to such parents were tested negative for HIV. According to officials, three babies who tested positive for HIV this year, were born to mothers who had not taken any treatment for the disease. Experts suggest that prolonged sessions of right medical treatment can put the HIV positive couples back on the track for a family life. The treatment programme to safeguard the foetus from the infection is called the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) and the mother is treated from the stage of inception of the pregnancy to the delivery.

Earlier, international hospitals/clinics asked those holding the PGIMER's HIV report to undergo the test again in absence of the certification. However, now these will accept PGI's reports. The PGI HIV lab is not only the first in Chandigarh but also in the entire north India, apart from New Delhi, in a government set-up to get National Accreditation Board for Calibration and Testing Laboratories (NABL) stamp. Being National Aids Control Organization’s (NACO) referral laboratory in the region, PGI is equipped with standardized tests and reports. Dr Sunil Arora, in charge NACO state reference laboratory, PGI, said, “There are few public labs which are under NABL. Annually, a report will be prepared for the renewal of the certificate. This report is considered verified and error-free by any HIV lab worldwide.” There are 800 HIV+ patients in the city who are registered with the PGI. The lab is also working on understanding why some HIV patients do not respond to some particular sets of medicines and have to be switched over to another regime, which has more side effects. “Anti-retroviral treatment has been found to be ineffective in some of the positives. Our lab is working on developing a model to resolve the problem,” said Dr Arora. The laboratory provides HIV diagnostic and disease monitoring (CD4 count test for viral load) services as per international standards. Since the services are fully sponsored by NACO (ministry of health &amp; family welfare), the HIV testing and CD4 count are offered free of cost in this laboratory to patients afflicted with this disease. NABL is a central agency which has laid down certain guidelines and gives accreditation following a very stringent criteria of assessment made by independent NABL-certified assessors. A Mohali-based hospital conducted a session to create AIDS awareness for around 75 mechanics at the Motor Market in Sector 48, on the occasion of World AIDS Day. Dr Varun, senior resident of blood bank educated the mechanics on “Prevention and control of HIV/AIDS”. Free HIV and hepatitis B and C tests were conducted on all those present at the occasion. Candlelight march To mark the World AIDS Day, a candlelight march was organized at Government College of Education on Saturday, to honour those living with HIV/AIDS. Vice-principal Renu Verma flagged-off the march.

However, her world literally fell apart when after few months of marriage, her husband tested positive for HIV. Her fears of having been infected by her husband proved incorrect when she tested negative. Many thoughts, including deserting Abhinav, crossed her mind then but she was truly in love with him. In her own words the ""thought of letting a virus ruin her married life was just not correct"". Though she decided to stay with Abhinav, her dreams of having children were shattered as unprotected sex with her husband could not only put her at risk of contracting the disease but could also infect the child that she desperately wanted. The couple had given up all hopes till someone told them that it might be possible for them to have their child through the assisted in-vitro fertilization (IVF) reproduction technique. After consultations with city-based doctors the couple went ahead with IVF and is now expecting their first child in another two months. ""We are praying that the child is free from HIV"", they say. While they may have some doubts, the doctors who carried out the procedure on them are however confident that the child would be ""normal and healthy"". However, they refused to disclose the name of nursing home as such patients object on it. Dr Neeraj Pahalajani, a leading city-based practitioner, said that world over, more than 400 cases have been documented where couples, with HIV positive husbands, have successfully had children through IVF/IUI technique. ""We have also used the same technique on several couples and are sure that their child too would be healthy"", she says. Elaborating, Dr Pahalajani said, however in IVF- ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) technique, the husband's semen, which carries the infection, is washed thoroughly using specific medical solutions and one single sperm is picked to fertilize the egg. The embryo is subsequently transferred into the mother's womb. But it is not 100% risk free. So they can also adopt other procedure of donor's sperm. Dr Pahalajani says with acceptance about HIV growing in the society, it is the responsibility of the medical fraternity to offer solutions to the HIV-infected couples to raise healthy families. "
190,12,2012,HIV positive children cry for attention,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/HIV-positive-children-cry-for-attention/articleshow/17447519.cms,"MADURAI: Five-year-old Chittu (name changed), a UKG student, is today a bubbly girl who is the cynosure of all eyes at the Russ Foundation in Madurai, where she lives along with 10 other HIV positive parentless boys and girls. But her early childhood was one of hardship and there are many out in the community in want of attention. According to Berlin Jose, founder-director of Russ Foundation, each of these children have a story of their own, but have successfully come out of their trauma and are doing well in the mainstream education system. Chittu for example was born to a female sex worker who made her income on the streets of Madurai. The woman who had a partner who was already married and had two children, was being used by him to make money. When she became sick and realized she was going to die of AIDS, she brought her three-year-old child, who was already begging on the streets of Madurai, to the home for adoption. She died a few days later. Her partner, however, who could not prove that he was the biological father of this child, was reluctant to give up the child because he had already chalked out plans to make money by making her beg. ""We went through a tough battle with him before the authorities handed her over to us,"" said Jose. Initially, the girl's stomach which was used to scavenging on food on the roadside, could not tolerate the well cooked warm food offered at the home. This HIV positive child suffered frequent bouts of diarrhoea. Staff at the home sometimes found her searching garbage bins for food and feeding on leftovers. ""It took us two whole months to bring her around and now she is doing very well in a normal school,"" he said. Apart from the children of the home, the foundation also works with 77 HIV positive children living in the community and about 650 non-infected children of HIV positive parents. This foundation has been able to successfully integrate HIV positive girls and boys into mainstream society, by their regular counseling and life skills classes. But according to Jose, girls more than boys face a lot of trauma on attaining puberty because society tries to stigmatize them as immoral persons. ""This is when they start hating their parents who are no longer alive. These girls become suicidal and depressed and need a lot of handholding to start realizing their potential as good individuals in society,"" he said. Boys on the other hand start thinking of life ahead and a future. Kumar, a boy who was expelled from a home for his mischief, is today a sturdy 18-year-old pursuing his SSLC at this home. He is also a caring brother to the smaller children; he wants to take up a career as a mechanical engineer. Selvam on the other hand who was brought to the home by his grandmother and aunt because his other relatives did not want him among them has no wish to study. But he is good with gadgets and wants to look after his grandmother and aunt well. On World AIDS Day, these children had a feast with 800 others to celebrate the occasion and look forward to life ahead. Jose says it is encouraging that the incidence of HIV/AIDS has come down in the state but added that the government should formulate a policy for the care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS. ""In no way should AIDS control programmes be relaxed because there are many who still have not been brought back into mainstream society,"" he adds. "

The HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2010-11, which was released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday, revealed that new infections among FSW have reduced in comparison to the figures of HSS 2008-09. The HSS showed that the HIV prevalence among FSW in 2010-11 has reduced from 3.82% to 1.28%. The national average of HIV prevalence among sex workers is 2.67%. In Rajasthan, the HIV prevalence among sex workers is below the national average. As part of the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programme, the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) and the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) have been promoting sale of condoms among high-risk groups which include sex workers in the state under the Condom Social Marketing (CSM) programme. They have also opened more than 9,228 non-traditional outlets, to sell condoms in the state to minimize the risk of HIV infection and also to reduce total fertility rate. The NGOs working for health of sex workers claimed that the FSW have become more attentive to their health. Yuwa Bharat Sansthan programme manager Pinki Shekhawat said, ""We have been working for FSW for a long time. Among the 600 FSWs in Jaipur with whom we are working, only one was tested positive for HIV."" She said the FSWs are using precautions properly to prevent HIV infection. ""Some of FSWs go to other states, which have high HIV prevalence, which is quite risky for them, but they are more careful there about their health,"" Shekhawat said. The FSWs undergo routine health check-up. The RSACS has also introduced targeted intervention to keep a check on the spread of prevalence of HIV among FSWs. There are around 22 targeted interventions working with FSW population in the state, RSACS sources said. In a survey conducted in 2005-06, it was found that there were 21,301 female sex workers in the state but now the number of FSW must have increased, an RSACS source added."

One out of every 200 pregnant women in the state tested positive for HIV in 2010-11. Further, Rajasthan figures in the category of highly vulnerable and high-priority state due to large migration of people to other cities for jobs. The alarming figures were reported in the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2010-11 report, released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday. The HIV prevalence in the age group of 15-49 years in the state has increased from 0.19% in 2008-09 to 0.49% in 2010-11, the report stated. While the national figures registered a dip of 0.27% for the same time frame, in Rajasthan the number of cases shot up by 0.30%. At the antenatal clinics, the HIV prevalence in Rajasthan is higher than neighbouring state Gujarat, which traditionally has a high number of pregnant women testing positive for HIV every year. According to the report, one out of 200 pregnant women tested positive for HIV in 2010-11 against one in 500 in 2008-09. The figures present a scary picture as the HIV prevalence among pregnant women has increased by more than two times. A large number of people also migrate to other big cities that have a high HIV prevalence which puts the state in the highly vulnerable category. People go to work in states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh which have high HIV prevalence, a health department official said. ""A large number of truckers pass through the state who are potential carriers of the HIV virus,"" another official said citing it as one of the reasons for high number of HIV positive cases in the state. Meanwhile, the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) have stepped up efforts to prevent the spread of HIV virus and has decided to extent testing facilities to the block level. A health department official, however, said the HSS figures are provisional. RSACS officials claimed that the HIV prevalence has not increased as per the figures collected from 182 existing Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC). At the ICTC, the RSACS officials conduct counseling and conduct HIV voluntary testing."

The centre came out with this damning report after conducting several studies on the subject. The centre's director Shashi Sahay, who closely worked with the HIV+ people, found patients living in the interior areas are irregular in collecting medicines from the free medicine distribution centres. ""Patients, especially women face apathy even from their family. In many cases, we find that they were kept in solitary confinement. The government is not keeping any record of such patients who were irregular in collecting medicines,"" she said. In many cases, they found that medicines to keep them fit become ineffective owing to malnourishment. Sahay cautioned the government that since state is turning into educational hub, Kota being one such example, youngsters are likely to indulge in activities which could contract HIV. ""Youth from all over the country in thousands are living here away from their families and therefore the probability to succumb to wrongful activities is higher,"" Sahay said. City-based NGOs working for HIV/AIDS left no stone unturned to organise several programmes creating awareness. RAYS organised a bike rally called BIKE-THON participated by motorcyclists and HIV+ children. The rally was kicked-off by Bollywood director Kabir Khan. Eighteen-month-old, Khushi, was the youngest HIV+ orphan at the event. ""Since Khushi came to our centre, all other kids have got little toys to play with. We have appointed one caretaker especially for Khushi,"" said Gurinder Virk, vice-president of RAYS adding that they adopted Khushi two months back. Nearly 30 children of Faith NGO presented a play at a private hospital and left audience spellbound."

Balangir has 70% of the state's MSM (men having sex with men) population. Official records reveal that in 2012, six HIV positive cases have been detected among the MSM community, which is considered a high-risk group. ""At present, there are 77 HIV positive patients in the district, who belong to the MSM community. This is 40% of the total number of HIV cases,"" said Ganeswar Panda, project manager at District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). He said Balangir, which falls in the 'A' category in terms of spread of the disease, has come under serious threat owing largely to the MSMs. ""Most of the MSM cases go unreported and making them aware of the need for having safe sex is also very difficult. That is why the chance of spreading the disease through them is considerably high,"" said Panda. He added that Titilagarh being a railway junction and a transit point for going to Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh, MSMs carry the disease across state borders. ""Besides, there are some MSMs who operate at another level. Some persons belonging to the high society have also been tested positive after having sex with them,"" said Vikrant Kindo, the chief district medical officer. Apart from the MSMs, migrant labourers also carry the disease back home from their work place. The CDMO said that since 2002, migrant labourers have contributed to 30 percent of the positive cases in the district. ""This year, four migrant labourers have died after being tested positive for AIDS,"" the CDMO added."

196,12,2012,HIV-affected children let their hair down,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/HIV-affected-children-let-their-hair-down/articleshow/17458517.cms," MADURAI: It was a memorable day for the 40 HIV positive children of St Ann's Care Centre, as they enjoyed every moment of the one-day tour of Madurai city organised specially for them on Sunday. For the children, who routinely spend their life in the centre and school, the trip turned out to be pleasant. The children, aged between six and 20, had the chance to enjoy the journey in plush cars, a couple of hours in Vishaal de Mal and a splendid evening at Eco Park at Thiruparankundram. This is the first time they were getting a glimpse of the city's posh shopping mall and Eco Park. The trip was organised by Rotary Club of Madurai Meenakshi along with Indian Red Cross Society, Madurai branch. The children are orphans, whose parents died of HIV. Children from various districts including Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga and Virudhunagar also stay in the centre. ""The trip was an unforgettable day in their life, as they visited places for the first time,"" said K Sakthi Anand, programme manager of the centre. The 7D theatre, dashing cars and moving bulls have become main attractions for children in the mall. Vignesh, an eighth standard boy, who was excited, said, ""I loved my maiden visit to a shopping mall. The moving bull there was my favourite. The entire day was fun with friends. The other playing equipment which we enjoyed there, otherwise I have seen only in television,"" he said. Ponmani, a 12th standard girl said, ""The devil house was a thrilling experience. Despite it being frightening, we loved it so much. Spending time in the toy helicopter was the other attraction for us."" ""Videos shown in the 7D theatre were a crowd-puller. We felt as if we are travelling under the sea with aquatic creatures, through fire flames and caves. Apart from the mall, the Eco Park served as a place to play in the evening after having mouth-watering biryani for lunch,"" said Saraswathi, a ninth standard girl, who lost her parents a few years back. ""It was a tough time for us to handle the elated children. It was a memorable experience not only for children but also for the organisers,"" said V M Jose, secretary, Red Cross, Madurai branch who organised the trip along with Ram Sundar, president, Rotary club, Madurai Meenakshi."

The petition was filed by Sheik Haseena of Nellore who was admitted to the local Triveni hospital for a cesarean operation on November 1, 2011. When doctors sought blood to perform the operation, the parents of the patient bought required units of blood from the Nellore Red Cross Society, and following the transfusion of the same, she was infected with AIDS. Soon after, her husband deserted her leaving her and her parents traumatized. Her counsel P Subhash told the bench headed by Justice D Appa Rao that the negligence of Red Cross was palpable and sought a compensation of Rs 95 lakh for the ‘unpardonable’ and ‘irreparable’ damage done to the petitioner. The bench sought the replies of Red Cross officials by January 18, 2013. Permission to cell tower scrapped Justice Nooty Ramaohan Rao on Monday suspended an order granting permission for installing a Tata Docomo cell tower at Chowdarguda village near Ghatkesar on the outskirts of the city. The judge made the interim order following a writ petition filed by B Srinivas Reddy and 11 others of the area, complaining that the local panchayat had granted the permission contrary to the guidelines issued by the state government in this regard. It was contended that the guidelines barred permission to cell towers in crowded residential areas, near school playgrounds and hospitals as they were sources of radiation. They pointed out that the present permission was contrary to the guidelines. Gali aide’s bail plea hearing The CBI court on Monday posted to Tuesday the hearing on the bail plea of M Ali Khan, the personal assistant of mining baron Gali Janardhan Reddy. The CBI which arrested Ali Khan recently named him as an accused in the illegal mining case.

199,12,2012,Children infected with HIV compose music for films,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Children-infected-with-HIV-compose-music-for-films/articleshow/17578533.cms,"CHENNAI: Suchitra of Periyapalayam is sixteen years old. But she has already composed music for a short film, Nambinavar Keduvadhillai, as well as done chorus singing for a few films. Suchitra is an HIV positive teenager living in Anandha Illam, a special home for HIV-affected children in Tiruvallur district. She is not the only talented minor. Ten-year-old Bharathi from the same home has composed background score for a documentary film on new drugs for TB. There are several other students in the institute who nurse similar ambitions. Many of them from the home have provided chorus for film scores. Be it traditional carnatic ragas or western harmonies and symphonies, these children can handle it all. This is largely due to a compulsory music course introduced by the trustees of the home. “We provide weekly music classes with a Kollywood music director, Ravi Verma, who teaches them to play keyboard and drums as well as train them in carnatic and western music,” said a campus administrator Muthupandian, as he pointed to a colourful and airy music room with several well maintained instruments. “I have been coming here to teach music to these children for the last three years,” said Ravi Verma, who has recently composed music for a Tamilmovie, Mayil Parai, which is slated to release next month. “Instead of regular vocal music, I have been teaching them to approach music like a composer. It’s wonderful to see the kind of compositions that they come up with. Generally, many people trained in music may be good at vocals or instruments, but cannot really compose as they have not been taught to think that way. These kids are getting an early advantage. They can read music too.” Another 14-year-old, Anusha too has music directorial ambitions and has already done some chorus work. “I recently did chorus work for the film Mayil Parai,” she said. “I am hoping to become a music director when I grow up.” While many HIV positve children in other parts of the country live in poverty and remain neglected with no hope of a decent life, let alone professional success, children at the Anandha Illam are lively and hopeful of a good future. The campus too is well-equipped with airy and colourful classrooms and dormitories (Names of the children have been changed to protect their identities.)"
200,12,2012,A dissolvable condom that can fight HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/A-dissolvable-condom-that-can-fight-HIV/articleshow/17580209.cms,"LONDON: Researchers have developed a female condom which they claim can protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV by dissolving inside the body and releasing chemicals. Besides blocking the sperm, the condom could time-release a potent mix of anti-HIV drugs and hormonal contraceptives, the ‘Daily Mail’ reported. Experts claim the ‘discreet protection’ can safeguard people from HIV and unwanted pregnancy by ‘melting’ inside the body. Researchers at the University of Washington (UW) developed the condom from tiny microfibres through a method called ‘electrospinning’ . The cloth-like fibres can be woven from medicine into extremely thin ‘webs’ . They are then designed to dissolve after use, either within minutes or over several days. The team was given $1 million to develop the technology, which uses an electric field to charge fluid through air to create the very fine , nanometre-sized fibres . “Our dream is to create a product women can use to protect themselves from HIV and unintended pregnancy,” Kim Woodrow, a UW assistant professor of bioengineering, said. “We have the drugs to do that. It’s really about delivering them in a way that makes them more potent , and allows a woman to want to use it,” Woodrow said. “This method allows controlled release of multiple compounds. We were able to tune the fibres to have different release properties ,” co-author Cameron Ball said. Porcupines key to painless needles IInspired by the structure of porcupine quills, researchers are working on less painful hypodermic needles that can penetrate the skin more easily and resist buckling. The North American porcupine carries an intimidating array of around 30,000 defencive quills on its back which it can bury in the flesh of predators. "

205,12,2012,"Among blood donors, 157 found HIV positive last year",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/Among-blood-donors-157-found-HIV-positive-last-year/articleshow/17763193.cms,"RAIPUR: Like any well-meaning citizen, Prakhar (name changed), a young man in his mid 20s, went to donate blood at a camp last year to fulfill his social responsibility. However, his world changed after the visit, as the blood test revealed that he was HIV positive. Prakhar was shattered. However, a year later, still unhappy with his fate, he's coping well and feels that the early detection, though unintended, saved his life. What happened to Prakhar brings to fore the grim reality of high prevalence of HIV positive people in the state who are ignorant of their status. Data provided by Chhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society (CSACS) reveals that of the total people who donated blood in 2011 in the state as many as 157 were found to be HIV positive. These people were not aware of the fact that they were carriers of the deadly virus. The detections happened as the donated blood is mandatorily tested for HIV virus and is completely destroyed, if found infected. Statistics show that there are 16 government and 22 private blood banks in the state, which collect blood through camps and also through replacements. Last year, 8185 units of blood was collected in camps and 50,132 people donated voluntarily. Of the 50,132 voluntary donations, 157 donors were found positive for HIV, implying that one out of every 320 people were carriers of the AIDS virus. According to the Chhattisgarh State Aids Control Society, transfusion of HIV-infected blood is also a major reason for transmission of the virus. The society stated that one should take blood only from a licensed blood bank where it is tested for HIV. In 2008, around 10,534 people had donated blood out of which 145 were tested HIV positive. In 2009 this figure increased to 150, from 24,164 donors. In 2010, of the 49,458 blood donations 154 were found to be positive for HIV. To deal with the problem, the CSACS has taken the issue seriously and kick-started awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS, interacting with people in their local dialects on the requisite precautions to be taken for the disease."
