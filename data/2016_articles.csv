0,1,2016,New lease of life: Doctors conduct kidney transplant on HIV+ Nigerian,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/New-lease-of-life-Doctors-conduct-kidney-transplant-on-HIV-Nigerian/articleshow/50461784.cms," 	BENGALURU: Oliver (name changed) from Nigeria was on a business trip to The Netherlands in 2012 when he suddenly became breathless and collapsed. The 37-year-old was later diagnozed with se vere renal damage. 	Found to be HIV positive in 2008, Ol iver gave up hope in life as none helped him overcome his kidney problem due to risks of retroviral infection in his body. He was on hemodialysis since No vember last till a team of city-based nephrologists conducted a successful renal transplant on him. 	Dr Rohan Augustine, consultant nephrologist at Manipal Hospitals, who has been treating Oliver since July 2015, said: “HIV patients were not considered transplant candidates as many believe that survival rates are less as the disease cripples the immune system. Also, transplant patients take drugs that suppress their immune system to prevent organ rejection, a regimen thought to further threaten their already fragile immune system.“ 	With good anti-retroviral therapy, HIV patients receiving transplants now have better chances. Transplantation is the best way forward even for such patients on dialysis if they are medically fit. Awareness on the advantages of transplantation on HIV patients is low in India, he added. 	“There is a taboo attached with HIV patients. My apprehensions were put to rest by the doctors here. They gave me a new lease of life,“ an elated Oliver said.His brother was his donor. 	Dr Sudarshan Ballal, chairman, Manipal Hospitals, said renal transplant in such patients needs careful management to ensure that the body doesn't reject the donor organ while infection too doesn't flare up. “Though many medical centres across the world are successfully doing kidney transplantation, HIV is still considered a contraindication to kidney transplantation in most Indian centres,“ he added. 	? 	?

Researchers used a mini-genome system to evaluate candidate drugs that could inhibit Ebola virus. Interferons and anti-HIV drugs showed antiviral activity against the Ebola virus in the studies. 	“Using this technology, scientists will be able to measure the inhibitory effects of their experimental drugs on the replication of Ebola virus. This approach will also decrease the possibility of the emergence of drug resistance,” said Eleanor Fish, study’s lead author. 	Interferon beta, the most potent inhibitor of Ebola, is now part of a clinical trial of individuals who were infected with Ebola during the recent outbreak in Guinea. "

The court relied on medical evidence and the minor's testimony to convict Amardeep Kujur. ""The nature of offence committed by the convict does not demand that he be released on probation. He has molested a child without parents and shown no mercy,"" additional sessions judge Gautam Manan said while punishing him for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault under POCSO.

7,1,2016,Greater access to HIV testing applauded,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Greater-access-to-HIV-testing-applauded/articleshow/50662124.cms,"MUMBAI: Stakeholders in India's HIV programme have applauded the decision of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) to modify outdated HIV testing regulations and allow community-based HIV testing in various set-ups. The Technical Research Group (TRG) has recently recommended community based screening using whole blood finger prick tests in population that has remained unaddressed. The TRG has also recommended testing in existing targeted intervention sites, community based screening through health camp approach for truckers and migrants, and provider initiated testing and counseling for pregnant women and TB patients. The NACO has also accepted the WHO's recommendation of using ancillary health care providers, including peer counsellors, for conducting HIV screening after adequate training. Other recommendations of TRG include acceptance of pre-test information instead of pre-test counseling and verbal consent in order to decrease the time and inconvenience for the testing and counseling procedure. The age of consent for HIV testing has also been recommended to be reduced to 16 instead of 18 to enhance early diagnosis. ""AIDS Healthcare Foundation has been a front-runner in the advocacy for community based testing globally for more than eight years and has conducted more than 7 million tests globally in the past two years. AHF, through its implementing partner in India, India Cares, has conducted more than 220000 tests and identified more than 1900 unreached people living with HIV/AIDS in India,"" said Dr Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager, AHF India. ""HIV testing must be scaled up in a big way around the world. Governments need to embrace community-based streamlined testing models that use rapid testing technologies and make testing free, convenient, hassle-free and easily accessible, particularly for the most affected populations. Testing results should be available the same day and there needs to be strong linkage to care and services for those who test HIV-positive,"" said Terri Ford, AHF chief of global advocacy and policy.

Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an extremely rare type of cancer involving immune system cells. Its diagnosis corroborates findings of the landmark study conducted by National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) that has underlined an increase in certain cancers which are not commonly seen among people living with HIV/AIDS in India. Known as a non-AIDS defining cancer (NADCs), ALCL can affect mouth, salivary glands, stomach, colon, rectum, anus, eye and brain among other organs. Researchers are trying to find out the reasons for their high growth rate. ""The woman, a homemaker, was brought to me on a wheelchair. She had severe pain in bones and had lost a lot of weight. ALCL is very difficult to diagnose because it is so rare. One needs to have a very high index of suspicion to diagnose this,"" said oncologist Padmaj Kulkarni of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, where the woman is being treated. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma of bone is extremely uncommon and only sporadic case studies are available in literature till date. ""The last case of this disease in an HIV infected patient was reported in ""Proceedings of Baylor University Medical Centre"" in 2015. The Pune woman is perhaps the 60th patient worldwide. It is rare even in non-HIV patients,"" Kulkarni said. Ameet Dravid, infectious diseases and HIV specialist from Pune, has been treating the woman. ""The woman came to me with complaints of fatigue and night sweating, back and neck pain and weight loss of five kg in a month.

Biopsy taken from her pelvic bone showed anaplastic large cell Non-Hodgkins lymphoma (ALCL). ""This cancer is very rare in HIV positive patients. In fact, in our series of 1,261 patients who had HIV with cancer, 30 were diagnosed with cancer. B-cell lymphomas were commonest while the woman is the only patient with ALCL,"" Dravid said. The woman was admitted to Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital in the second week of December last year for pain control, feeding and other supportive care. Her nuclear medicine imaging (PET-CT) scan was also unique as it showed that only bones were affected with no lymph nodes or any other organ being involved. The patient was put on chemotherapy. ""It was very difficult to give her the right dose of chemotherapy as low dose would not control her cancer while a high dose might lead to death.

The project is aimed to diagnose 90% of such drug addicts with HIV and put them under treatment by 2020. 	The project is expected to kick-start from this month itself, an official source said. 	North-eastern states like Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland account for highest adult (15-49 years) HIV prevalence in the country, latest government data showed. Estimates of 2015 show Manipur tops the list with adult HIV prevalence of 1.15%, followed by Mizoram (0.80%), Nagaland (0.78%), Andhra Pradesh &amp; Telangana (0.66%), Karnataka (0.45%), Gujarat (0.42%) and Goa (0.40%). The national average for adult HIV prevalence is estimated at 0.26% in 2015. 	Besides these states, Maharashtra, Chandigarh, Tripura and Tamil Nadu have also shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence. 	 Source: NACCO 	 	However, the government is particularly concerned about the north-eastern states because it feels the adult HIV prevalence rate in these states is driven by drug injecting people. “The HIV epidemic in the North Eastern (NE) region is primarily driven by injecting drug use and this is compounded by unsafe sexual behaviours. The porous international borders, hilly terrain, poor road and transport communications, disturbed law and order situations pose many challenges for NE states in scaling up HIV prevention, care and treatment efforts among key populations and the general population. This has adversely affected the scale and quality of services,” an official note on Project Sunrise said. 	According to the note, the national average for prevalence of HIV among drug addicts is 7.14%, whereas in Manipur it is 12.9% and in Mizoram it is 12%. 	The Project Sunrise, steered by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) under the health ministry, will also aim to create more awareness about the disease in these N-E states. The project will be funded under the Centre for Disease Control and will be implemented in coordination with state AIDS control organisations and non-government organisations (NGOs) working in this area. The government also plans to employ consultants privy to local settings in these states who can help improve the outreach of various initiatives planned under the project. 	“The Sunrise Project will be implementing a data-driven approach that will strategically focus on geographic areas and populations to ensure that we are doing the right things, in the right places, at the right time to achieve epidemic control among people who inject drugs,” an official said. 	Other initiatives planned under the Project include enhancing capacity of state-level institutions in high burden areas, community mobilization, intervention among females injecting drugs and spouses of such people. 	The government also plans to establish a real-time data capturing and program monitoring software solution side by side. This would automate flow of information in near real time at site, district, state and national level, enabling the Centre to timely review the developments and take required action to fill in the gaps. 	Latest estimates by NACO estimates around 21.17 lakhs people living with HIV in India in 2015. Of this 6.54% were children below 15 years of age. "

The survey findings were released to the media on Friday.The state's mining and industrial pockets areas continue to record high prevalence of HIV cases despite numerous government intervention schemes.The findings, which are based on screening camps and integrated counseling and testing centres (ICTC) in 23 districts (excluding Garhwa), have recorded 1,496 positive cases in the past year. Of them, around 1,035 cases have been documented in the five districts. Ranchi has recorded 264 new cases, while Dhanbad has witnessed 114. East Singbhum district, including Jamshedpur, has recorded 188 new cases. Giridih has recorded 125 new HIV cases while Palamu has 132. However, Hazaribag has the most number of cases with 344 new infections in 2015. The survey is based on the screening of at least 1.07 lakh people, including priority groups such as sex workers, truck drivers and migrant workers, JSACS said. Dr Shami Akhtar, state programme officer for intervention in JSACS, said the number of new cases have recorded a marginal fall (0.02%) from 2014-15. During 2014-15, 1,645 new HIV infections were reported statewide. While Ranchi recorded 315 new infections during that period, Hazaribag remained the most affected with 463 positive cases out of 17,000 people screened. While the body attributed most of the new infections to migrant workers who were screened on their return home during festivals, JSACS suspects a larger number of unidentified HIV patients. ""The numbers can be anywhere between 30,000 to 36, 000 people,"" Akhtar said. According to National Aids Control Organization (NACO) statistics of 2013-14, Jharkhand has over 18,000 HIV positive patients. ""Migration is an issue which is beyond our control. We can only monitor the migrants' health,"" Akhtar added. These statistics come amid a host of intervention programmes being organized by the state health, education and family welfare department with assistance from the Centre, which includes providing condoms at subsidized rates from counters under the National Aids Control Program (NACP).

""There will be a significant shortfall in the funding needed for HIV control in sub-Saharan Africa in the coming years and those countries with the highest HIV burden will be unable to meet their obligations on their own to sustain control efforts,"" according to researchers at Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health.India too has many issues with medication and finances for HIV control programmes; many patient groups throughout 2015 complained out drug stockouts that resulted in the most vulnerable patients not getting their medicines continuously as prescribed.In a research paper that appeared in the BMJ Open on Sunday, the researchers calculated that the price tag for providing long-term HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in 2015-2050 in the nine sub-Saharan countries most affected by the epidemic ranges from $98 billion at current coverage levels to $261 billion if coverage is scaled up.""The HIV epidemic is far from over,"" said first author Rifat Atun, professor of global health systems, in a press release sent by the school of public health. ""The magnitude of funding needed to sustain the HIV fight is very large and the consequences of complacency even larger.""Atun and colleagues looked at the nine countries that account for 70% of the HIV burden in Africa—Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. ""They modeled these countries’ HIV/AIDS funding needs through 2050, based on four different scenarios of coverage levels, using data from Spectrum, a publicly available tool used by UNAIDS,"" said the release. The researchers say that ‘front-loading’ investments now will be necessary to ensure that higher levels of coverage are achieved. This would ultimately reduce HIV transmission and future funding obligations.Domestic financing, the most important source of funding for HIV, will not be sufficient to meet future obligations, so new, innovative sources of funding will be necessary to both maintain and expand treatment and prevention.""The problem of predictable and sustainable funding must be resolved,"" said Atun, noting in the paper that, ""There is an ethical responsibility to continue financing for those receiving ART, and not abandon them to death."""

This assumes significance as the AIDS control programme, which is on the verge of maturing from receiving international funding, suffered a huge cut in budgetary allocation last year. This led to shortage of condoms, medicines and testing kits across the country. In fact some states also sacked healthcare workers involved with the programme blaming it on financial crunch. However, this year's budget has proposed an allocation of Rs 1,615 crore for the programme, as compared to Rs 1,300 crore under the revised estimates of 2015-16. ""We are taking a holistic approach. Therefore, we have now covered over 1 lakh patients for third-line treatment. We have also raised the bar for CD4 count for those who will be eligible for free treatment,“ health minister J P Nadda said. Currently, anyone who has a CD4 cell count of 350, and consequently, a very high viral load, is eligible for free ARTs. Under the new plan, which will be implemented from April, patients below 500 CD4 count will get free ARTs. This is in line with the guidelines from World Health Organisation (WHO), which recommends free ARTs for all HIV patients. According to a senior official, the increase in coverage of patients for free ARTs alone would entail an investment of around Rs 75-80 crore. Besides, the plan to introduce third-line treatment is estimated to be worth Rs 11crore. Besides, the government has also cleared a tender to procure 325 million pieces of condoms from the open market, a process which was pending for almost four years. Though latest HIV estimates by the government shows a 66% decline in new cases in the last five years, India still has the third highest number of people living with HIV and recorded an average of 86,000 new infections in 2015.

Therefore most cases that are lost to follow-up are during these initial months,"" Dr Kedar Mehta, said researcher .The counselling sessions also include the family members of the patients in an attempt to minimize the stigma which experts believe still remain the major challenge for the treatment of the viral infection.Mehta added that stigmatisation of HIV/AIDS patients also cause many patients to stop their treatment. ""Many HIV positive patients hide their illness from relatives. As a result they do not take the regular medicines to avoid the questions,"" Mehta told TOI.According to previous studies conducted at the ART centre of the hospital, each year 19 per cent of the patients go missing after the first few sessions, leaving the treatment half way.

34,3,2016,HIV+ but champion body-builder,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/HIV-but-champion-body-builder/articleshow/51449122.cms,"Allahabad: At the age of 29, his six-pack abs, wide chest and rounded shoulders are enough to impress anyone. But one thing which makes Dinesh Kumar Yadav of Jaunpur different from other body-builders is that this young man is HIV positive from birth. Dinesh has proved that even a HIV positive patient can live a normal and healthy life. Today he is Mr Eastern UP, a motivational speaker and from the past one decade, helping hundreds of other HIV positive people like him, many of whom had lost all hopes. Dinesh’s physique and strength gives them a new ray of hope. Born on Independence Day in 1986, Dinesh was in the city recently. Interacting with TOI, he shared his ups and downs of life. Dinesh still remembers that he often used to miss school because of illness. Neither he, nor his mother had idea of why he was ill. Even his mother also used to fell ill quite often. “I also wanted to enjoy sports like others but was unable to enjoy because of breathlessness even after slight running,” he said. “I was in class VII, when my mother was referred to SGPGI in Lucknow, where she was diagnosed HIV positive. She was asked to go to Mumbai for further treatment. In following months, my parents used to go time and again for treatment,” Dinesh recalled. “On one such visit, I started pestering that I will also go with them and they agreed ‘ki chalo le chalte hain, isse bhi dikha denge’ (let us take him too and get him checked up). There I was also diagnosed HIV positive,” he added. “No one told me that I am suffering with AIDS,” he said. In 2006, a councillor told him that what this disease is all about and how he has to take extra care, Dinesh, a postgraduate in philosophy from Jaunpur University, recalled. His life took a U-turn in 2009 when Red Ribbon Express, an informative exhibition train run by government to make people aware of AIDS, arrived in Jaunpur. “I saw pictures of Pradeep Kumar, a body builder from Manipur. I thought if he could why not me and from that moment, my life got an aim and soon I joined a gym and started working on my body,” Dinesh said. In 2013, Dinesh won Mr Eastern UP Award and a clipping of his life was shown in Amir Khan’s Satyamev Jayate. Reputed institution started calling him for giving motivating speech and his fame grew. Today, he is the project coordinator of Jaunpur Network for HIV Positive People Living with AIDS Society. “My only dream is to motivate people fight with AIDS and make make them aware so that they should not be infected with HIV even accidentally,” Dinesh said."

India has the third-highest number of people with HIV in the world with number of those infected by the deadly virus standing at 21.17 lakh. Although HIV epidemic in the country is slowing down with a 19% decline in new HIV infections (130,000 in 2013) and a 38% decline in AIDS-related deaths between 2005 and 2013, the proportion of people who do not have access to antiretroviral therapy treatment is still very high at around 64%. Agreeing to hear a PIL for setting up hospitals exclusively for treatment of HIV-infected patients in every district, a bench of Justices J S Khehar and C Nagappan issued notice to Centre seeking its response. The court passed the order on a petition filed by senior advocate Paramananda Katara who contended that every HIV- infected patient must be provided antiretroviral therapy at affordable price immediately after the diagnosis to stop the deadly virus from multiplying. At the end of 2013, only 7 lakh people were on antiretroviral therapy, the second largest number of people on such treatment in any country.""Helpless patients suffering with HIV/AIDS are dying all over the country as there are no exclusive hospitals to deal with this disease. There are no HIV-testing centres in rural areas and it leads to spread of the virus. It is a fundamental duty of the Centre and state governments to provide immediate medical treatment to HIV/AIDS patients,"" he told the bench. Contending that prisoners and sex workers are more prone to being affected by the virus, the petitioner contended that testing centres must be set up in jail premises and red light areas.HIV prevalence in the country is estimated at 0.3%. This figure is small compared to most other middle-income countries in the world but because of huge population this equates to more than 21 lakh people living with HIV. Around 1.3 lakh people died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2013."

Founder and president of FXB, an international humanitarian organization that works with the world's disadvantaged to break the cycle of poverty and combat HIV/AIDS, du Boisrouvray sold off her jewellery and donated two thirds of her fortune in 1989 to set up FXB in the memory of her son Francois-Xavier Bagnoud, a rescue pilot who died in a helicopter crash in Mali in 1986.In India, FXB Suraksha is almost a decade old but du Boisrouvray first began work in the state of Goa in 1990 caring for babies of commercial sex workers who had no treatment against AIDS and would often die leaving behind orphans. She set up a number of AIDS prevention education information centres and funded the education of 50 little boys from disadvantaged sections of the society from Sanguem. At the ongoing HIV Congress in the capital city, Du Boisrouvray was conferred with the meritorious service award for her invaluable contribution for the care and support of people living with HIV/AIDS. Health reasons prevented her from personally receiving the award but she told STOI from Portugal that she was humbled and touched that her work received recognition. She recalled the time when HIV/AIDS was still taboo and AIDS orphans were not even recognized in the state. ""There was a lot of ignorance surrounding the transmission of AIDS and nobody wanted to even touch aids orphans. It was an upstream battle,"" she told STOI.FXB was one of the first NGOs invited by the National AIDS control organization, part of the Indian ministry of health and family welfare and was also granted official status by the Indian government in 1999 to organize HIV and AIDS prevention activities in the slum areas around Jaipur city. Du Boisrouvray was instrumental in getting May 7 recognized as World AIDS Orphans Day after she presented UN secretary general Kofi Annan with two million signatures in support of the day. FXB's integrated community-based village programme gives a grant to participants to set up a business and decreases its investment over three years as revenues and savings of participants increase. ""When we started, I rejected the then vogue for micro-credit as a solution to global poverty as it was clear to me that the extreme poor would never be able to provide a sufficient return to repay loans,"" says the former journalist and designer who also set up her own film production company in the past.FXB India Suraksha is looking to start new programs to fight cross border trafficking in Manipur in the North East, Myanmar and China. Governor Mridula Sinha at the awards ceremony function said the HIV virus could be prevented through mass awareness programmes."

""Antiretroviral drugs are very good at controlling HIV infection. But patients on antiretroviral therapy who stop taking the drugs suffer a rapid rebound in HIV replication,"" said Kamel Khalili, from the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in US. The presence of numerous copies of HIV weakens the immune system and eventually causes AIDS. Eliminating the HIV virus after it has become integrated into CD4+ T-cells, the cells primarily infected with the virus, has proven difficult. Recent attempts have focused on intentionally reactivating HIV, aiming to stimulate a robust immune response capable of eradicating the virus. However, none of these ""shock and kill"" approaches has been successful. Researchers targeted HIV-1 proviral DNA (the integrated viral genome) using uniquely tailored gene editing technology. Their system includes a guide RNA that specifically locates HIV-1 DNA in the T-cell genome, and a nuclease enzyme, which cuts the strands of T-cell DNA. Once the nuclease has edited out the HIV-1 DNA sequence, the loose ends of the genome are reunited by the cel''s own DNA repair machinery.Researchers focused on infected CD4+ T cells to show that the technology eliminates the virus from cells and also its persistent presence in HIV-1-eradicated cells protects them against reinfection. The researchers carried their work over to ex vivo experiments, in which T-cells from patients infected with HIV were grown in cell culture, showing that treatment with the gene editing system can suppress viral replication and reduce viral load in patient cells.

""Truckers are usually the first ones to contract the disease which is then spread around the mining settlements,"" statistical officer of JSACS Sudeep Sanyal said. JSACS authorities said the decision to seek external comes after the re-filling of condom vending machines in high risk areas was stopped after the suppliers ended their agreement with National Aids Control Organization (NACO) in 2014. The halt in supplies forced JSACS to remove the vending machines from 50 spots in urban pockets and high priority areas in mining districts. ""The subsidized condom distribution programme cannot kick off in the state unless other measures are taken,"" a JSACS officer said. JSACS has sought help under the funds allocated for the corporate social responsibility activities and will approach the companies to distribute condoms among these vulnerable groups at subsidized rates and help organize regular screening to detect new positive cases. This comes at a time when as many as 16,905 people are living with HIV disease in the state and new infections are on the rise. ""A large number of HIV positive cases are hidden from our knowledge because they have not got themselves screened. The population mostly comprises of migrant workers and truckers and can infect thousands more,"" said Shami Akhtar, state programme officer of JSACS. The data collected by JSACS through various screening camps across 24 districts show that at least 1,500 people contracted infections in 2015. The numbers are higher in industrial and mining districts of East Singbhum, Dhanbad, Giridih, Seraikela-Kharsawan and Hazaribag. Besides condoms, the JSACS will also approach the industrial houses for contributing to the awareness campaigns in the high priority areas. "

Presently out of every three cases detected, one is a female compared to one in eight or 10, a few years ago. Recent data released by Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), nearly 31.2 % of the infected females belong to the age group of 15-34 as compared to about 36.7 % infected males who belonged to this age group in 2015.While infection through blood and blood products and infected syringes and needles is negligible, sexual route is the predominant mode of transmission and it ranged between 83 to 95% followed by mother-to-child transmission at 4 to 8 %.Dr Vanda Viegas, senior physician posted at Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, attributes the relative rise in HIV infection among females to a pattern, which she says is obvious. While earlier the rate of infection was predominantly high among men who have sex with men (MSM), the focus now is on women. And this is hardly surprising with sexual route being the main route of transmission in the state, she says.Viegas, who is exposed to a varied number of HIV/AIDS cases, said of late, she has observed HIV infection among some widows as well. Most of these women got the infection from their husbands. Inquiries revealed that husbands of these women died around seven-ten years ago of tuberculosis, which is an opportunistic infection that persons having HIV/AIDS virus get. ""These women never got tested for HIV infection after the death of their husband,"" says Viegas. They are now coming for testing, when the virus has become dominant in their body.The GSACS data reveal that in 2013, proportion of females among the sero-positive cases was 42.1% whereas in 2015, proportion of females among the sero-positive cases was 45.5 %.HIV is prevalent in all parts of the state, and the majority of the cases are reported from the four coastal talukas, Mormugao, and Salcete in South Goa, and Bardez and Tiswadi in North Goa."

The district superintendent of police R V Ramya Bharati had earlier formed three special teams led by deputy superintendent of police, Pollachi sub-division, T Charles, to crack the case. Preliminary investigation revealed that the woman from Dindigul district, Malathi, was last seen travelling along with three men in an auto rickshaw.Police came to know that the woman had many affairs and had been taking treatment for HIV at a government hospital in Dindigul. Two of the special teams had left for Kerala on Wednesday and detained the suspect for interrogation on Thursday morning.Meanwhile, another suspect in the case surrendered before the judicial magistrate court in Dindidgul and he was later remanded to judicial custody. Investigating officials said they would soon file a petition before the court for the police custody of the suspect surrendered in Dindidgul for interrogation. One more person in connection with the case is still on the run.On Tuesday, the woman was found murdered near Pollachi railway junction with her throat slit. Upon receving information about it, the Pollachi police visited the crime scene from where they recovered a travel bag, containing medical receipt.

The message on the board reads: ""You are the most beautiful, compassionate and best mom in the world: All girls"".The girls are 54 HIV+ residents of Janani Dham and the message is for Daxa Patel, an HIV positive woman herself. She is also secretary of Gujarat Network of People Living with HIVAIDS (GSNP+) which runs Janani Dham.Around 50% of the girls are orphans while the others have only one parent. But all of them consider Daxa Patel their mother.Five-year-old Chandani (name changed) runs to Daxa and hugs her when that latter comes to Janani Dham. The little girl is HIV positive. She was two months old when she was found abandoned by the Mehsana police at the railway station. Chandani was handed over to Daxaben and has been at Janani Dham since then. Next year, the girl will be admitted in a nearby school.Same is the story of Nandini, a 14-year-old HIV positive orphan girl who was brought to this place when she was six. ""Daxa is our mother. We owe our life to her,"" says Nandini.Janani Dham, a brain child of Daxa Patel, has been functioning since 2009 and is run in private-public partnership. It is supported by Gujarat government's Social Justice Department and Surat-based P P Savani Group.""These young girls have a right to live in society with dignity. Yet they face discrimination,"" says Daxa. ""Like every mother who dreams of a better future of her children, I too feel the same way for my 54 girls. I want to bring them back into the social mainstream by ensuring them quality education and facilities."" She said that all the staff of Janani Dham are also HIV positive."

The boy, who is three-and-half years old, had suffered 40% burns and was admitted to GMCH in April, 2015. He was kept there for more than five months. During that time, he underwent multiple blood transfusions as the injuries were quite serious and could have claimed his life.The GMCH immediately ordered an inquiry after the matter came to light on Monday. “Both me and my husband are HIV negative. Then, how could our baby tested HIV positive? My son underwent six blood transfusions at GMCH. When he tested positive for HIV, we told the hospital authorities that he received blood at GMCH. But they asked us to keep quiet,” said the boy’s mother.The boy’s family is from Hajo, about 35 km from Guwahati. The family is yet to lodge a police complaint.B K Bezbaruah, the superintendent of GMCH, told TOI that the institute carefully examines every blood sample. He said he had no idea how the incident happened. “We are investigating the matter and an inquiry has been ordered. The child was admitted to the hospital in a serious condition last April. He had suffered 40% burn injuries and was kept at the hospital for more than five months. But after this, the patient and his family didn’t come for treatment,” said Bezbaruah.He added that the child had multiple wounds even after surgeries and it is possible that he came into contact with someone who is HIV positive after that. “After more than five months of treatment at GMCH, the patient and his parents didn’t come to the hospital for some time. It could be during this time that the child contracted HIV from someone who was already infected,” said Bezbaruah.In April, the boy was again admitted to the GMCH and was found HIV positive during a routine test, officials at the hospital said. The child is on ART treatment. The tragic incident is a grim reminder of the June, 2013 incident when five persons were given contaminated blood at the Mangaldai Civil Hospital in Assam’s Darrang district."

Till September 30, 2015, Kamrup (Metro) district reported 4,268 HIV-positive cases as per the district-wise detection of HIV-positive cases. Out of this, 1.5% of the cases were due to intravenous usage.So rampant have been the cases that chief minister Tarun Gogoi recently expressed concern over the menace and even asked the chief secretary to constitute a 'task force' headed by the additional chief secretary.IDU groups are categorised as high risk groups (HRGs) among other HRGs like 'men having sex with men' (MSM) and 'female sex workers' (FSW). IDU groups alone comprise 1.46% of the concentration of HIV epidemic as compared to 1.4% for MSM, and 0.46% for FSW, as per the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) data from 2010-11 to 2015.""The new cases of injecting users being reported from the city are quite worrisome. IDU is a broad group. Casual injecting users are easily vulnerable as they do not pay attention to the condition of the syringe. There is a need for intervention so that new habitual users are diverted from syringes to opioid oral tablets under supervision,"" said Chiranjeev Bhattacharjya, state epidemiologist, Assam State Aids Control Society (Asacs).As per the 2015 AIDS Fact Sheet published by the Assam State Aids Control Society (Asacs), the annual occurrence of new HIV infections is showing a downward trend in high-prevalence states like Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. However, the trend is upward in Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.The rate of increase in new HIV infections annually is the highest in Assam and Tripura. Intravenous drug practice is one of the contributing factors.Authorities have also expressed concern over the involvement of school students as users and as racketeers. ""The rise in drug usage is contributed to by a lack of awareness among the youths, their parents and educational institutions. Drug usage is a different set of disease and should be handled differently. The onus should be on harm reduction,"" said Rajeeb Sharma of Global Organisation for Life Development, a voluntary organization.AIDS experts and voluntary organizations have called for greater intervention and awareness generation among the youths to prevent them from using injecting and other forms of drugs. They have also suggested roping in parents and schools to combat the new menace."

Every blood bank will be connected online. Information about blood donors, including frequency of donation, will be available online. The system will minimize errors and prevent spread of diseases,"" said Chiranjeev Bhattacharjya, state epidemiologist, Assam State AIDS Control Society.""The electronic system will be functioning very soon. The system is a technical one and will need resourceful persons,"" said P Baruah of Assam State AIDS Control Society. Till September 30, 2015, there were 11,122 HIV-positive people in Assam. In the same period, 8,049 were registered on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and 3,583 patients were alive on ART.Blood transfusions in Assam are fraught with risks. In June 2013, five persons received HIV-positive blood in Mangaldai Civil Hospital in Darrang district. On Monday, a three-and-a-half-year-old child undergoing treatment for burn injuries at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) received HIV-positive blood.""This system will prevent liars and dubious professional blood donors from donating. It will also enable taking stock of existing blood supplies,"" said health expert NK Beria.There are three regional blood transfusion centres one each in GMCH, Assam Medical College Hospital and Silchar Medical College Hospital.According to a 2015 'fact sheet' of Assam State AIDS Control Society, the blood bank at GMCH is considered to be a 'state-of-the-art model blood bank'."

Reason? There is severe fund crunch with the government curtailing the budget. The only centre in AP for training counsellors is at the psychology department of AU.AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) sources said due to 20% cut in the annual budget for the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), officials could not take up the mandatory training sessions for the district level counsellors. For the years 2014 to 2016, the budget has been cut from Rs 1,700 crore to Rs 1,300 crore. This has affected the HIV/AIDS control programme. A portion of the fund is diverted to Swachh Bharat and skill development programmes.Earlier, the training centre for counsellors used to get funds from abroad routed through the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) under the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria project. But after the stipulated eight-year period of funding was over, there was no money to continue the project. Project director and head of the of AU psychology department Prof MVR Raju said, ""We used to train counsellors every three months, with around 30 counsellors in each batch. Each ART or HIV treatment centre in the state is supposed to have counsellors for patients and there are more than 700 such counsellors in the state. But since the last two years, we didn't receive any funding from APSACS. The HIV/AIDS control programme is not being given much importance in the last two years. Not only for this project, but for other educational projects too, we find the funds not forthcoming and on enquiry find that part of UGC funds gets diverted for skill development and Swachh Bharat.""Even the State AIDS Control Society officials admitted to the shortage of funds for the last two years and reduction in NACO budget. A SACS official said, ""The new government doesn't encourage international donors like UNICEF and global funds and NACO had to undergo a budget cut in 2014-16 period of Rs 400 crore. The various SACS used to get funds directly from NACO but even that was discontinued and SACS had to get them through government treasury. Every time, there would be a delay of 4-5 months.""""However, the treasury system was removed this year and again we are directly getting funds from NACO and after all the states had complained about the budget cut, the allocation for NACO has been raised to its earlier Rs 1,700 crore from this fiscal. But due to the 20% cut in the last two years, we were unable to give salaries, organise capacity building, training programmes and workshops all over India and the overall HIV/AIDS control programme had been hit,"" added the SACS official."

This time, a doctor insulted an HIV positive pregnant patient by denying her treatment in the hospital. According to sources, one Manju Devi of village Pawai under Muffasil police station reached Aurangabad sadar Hospital to get herself admitted. When she met the doctor on duty, Dr Lalsa Sinha, she was allegedly refused treatment because Manju was HIV positive. ""Tum yahan HIV faila dogi, jaldi jao yahan se (you would spread this deadly disease here, go away),"" the doctor allegedly shouted at Manju.When Manju's attendants argued with the doctor to get her admitted, the doctor allegedly got furious and asked the ward boy to throw the patient on road. ""I will not treat you and this is my decision,"" Manju quoted the doctor as saying. Since Manju is from economically backward family, she could not afford treatment at any private clinic or hospital. ""Mai nao mahine ki garbhwati hoon, pati driver hai. Paisa hai nahi, kahan jaun kya karoon kuch samajh main nahi aa raha hai (I am nine months pregnant, my husband is a driver. I have no money. Where would I go),"" Manju told this correspondent.However, medical officer Dr Ravi Ranjan said HIV is neither a fatal disease nor it spreads by contact. HIV patients can lead a normal life while taking timely medicine. He said nobody has the right to discriminate against HIV patients.When contacted, civil surgeon Dr Rampratap Singh said, ""We will look into the matter.""He admitted that the hospital does not have sufficient resources to ensure normal delivery to HIV patients. It may be mentioned here that sadar hospital has earned a bad name in recent times because of alleged rude behaviour of doctors resulting in law and order problems. "
54,5,2016,No special day for HIV patients' surgery,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/No-special-day-for-HIV-patients-surgery/articleshow/52455917.cms," Patna: The Patna Network of People Living with HIV/Aids has alleged that government hospitals in Bihar have been denying surgeries to patients with HIV for long, and that the state government is not unaware of it. The Network cites the death of a 45-year-old woman suffering from intestinal obstruction at the Patna Medical College &amp; Hospital (PMCH) in 2012, four days after being admitted to the premier hospital. Gyan Ranjan of the Network attributes her death to denial of surgery for her abdomen-related complaint despite the media highlighting her story. Sources said the government ordered a probe into her death, but the probe panel found no one guilty. It, however, recommended that patients with HIV be operated in government hospitals every Saturday. The idea was that the OTs after such surgeries would be properly fumigated the next day being a Sunday before being used for surgeries on non-HIV patients on Monday onwards till Friday. Asked if PMCH had slotted a specific day for surgeries on patients with HIV, PMCH superintendent Dr Lakhindra Prasad replied in the negative. He, however, told TOI earlier this week, ""Surgeries are performed on patients with HIV as and when required."" Persons with HIV apart, even their children remain a neglected lot. All persons with HIV and their children are given anti-retroviral drugs to prevent the virus in their body from multiplying. Children are prescribed special drugs for the purpose. However, many ART centres have reported non-availability of these drugs with them. Sources on Thursday told TOI the drugs for such children are out of stock at the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres at Darbhanga Medical College &amp; Hospital in Darbhanga and Anugrah Narain Magdh Medical College &amp; Hospital in Gaya. At the government medical college and hospital in Bhagalpur, only 15 days' stock is left. Experts say this can be dangerous. ""Missing the dose leads to further weakening of the immune system... Also, the virus could become stronger than the drug whenever it is given next,"" said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, former member of the Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS). Senior BSACS official B Gupta admits the shortage of drugs. ""We are not getting supplies from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). We are managing things by supplying drugs from one centre to another,"" Gupta told TOI on Thursday. However, NACO's national programme officer B B Rewari blamed it on the state. ""From our end, the supply flow is perfect. The problem is with the state supply chain to districts,"" he said. "

Today even a 90-year-old can contract the virus.""The audience fell silent for a moment before breaking into applause.Despite the efforts of activists like Pokrovsky, the total number of registered HIV cases in Russia exceeded one million in late 2015, with authorities struggling to contain an epidemic that experts say could be curbed by increased funding and more awareness campaigns.Pokrovsky has been openly critical of the Kremlin's policies promoting traditional family values, saying they have failed to halt the spread of the deadly virus.""In 2015 alone, some 100,000 new HIV cases were reported in Russia,"" Pokrovsky told AFP.""This is a very high rate, maybe the highest in Europe.""The Russian government's policy focuses on treatment while neglecting prevention drives such as sex education in schools, with the number of people infected with the virus soaring as a result, say experts.A public health campaign in Moscow last year urged people to be faithful to their partners, rather than promoting condom use.""Young people here often don't even know what HIV is and don't understand its dangers,"" said Moscow-based student Darya Belimova who joined Pokrovsky to address more than a thousand young people at the conference.The gathering was part of the ""Stop HIV/AIDS"" prevention campaign spanning more than 200 universities.Although the Russian health and education ministries support ""Stop HIV/AIDS"", activists and volunteers say they are fighting a lonely battle against Russia's AIDS epidemic as the virus increasingly affects the heterosexual population.The World Health Organization last year said that Russia accounted for 60 percent of all HIV diagnoses in Europe in 2014, with heterosexual sex the main route of transmission of the virus which is spread through contact with contaminated body fluids.The number of HIV-positive minors which stood at 9,792 in 2015 has also jumped 8.5 percent compared to the previous year.In most of these cases an HIV-positive mother transmitted the virus to the child at birth, said Pokrovsky.""In Russia, there is not enough public financing to support the fight against HIV at a national scale, and HIV prevention programmes for drug addicts practically don't exist,"" he said.There are just a few dozen NGOs working to fight the epidemic, spread across 40 Russian cities.""For Russia, this is a very small number,"" Pokrovsky said.Organizations like the Andrey Rylkov Foundation which runs an outreach programme for drug users in Moscow, handing out clean needles and condoms receive no government funding.The vast size of the country also presents a challenge for effective prevention, with far-flung corners of the federation like Siberia particularly badly affected.Russia also bans methadone replacement therapy for drug addicts, which would allow users to avoid injections, eliminating the risk of contracting the virus from contaminated syringes.Many Russian NGOs, including those working on HIV prevention among drug addicts, have been under increased pressure since the reelection of President Vladimir Putin to a third term in 2012.Shortly after he was sworn in once again, the government passed a law allowing authorities to brand groups engaging in broadly-defined ""political activity"" that receive foreign funding as ""foreign agents"".The legislation was passed soon after huge anti-Putin protests rocked Moscow, and Kremlin critics see the law as a way to muzzle the strongman's critics and tighten his grip on power.In April, a court ordered that Sotsium, an HIV prevention NGO based in the southwestern city of Saratov, be labelled ""foreign agents"" after it received 1.5 million rubles ($22,400) in foreign funding to conduct a survey among drug addicts and people with HIV.""Until recently, society wasn't really aware of the magnitude of the problem,"" said Sergei Smirnov, vice-chair of the Foundation for Social and Cultural Initiatives, the organization behind the ""Stop HIV/AIDS"" campaign.If the growth of HIV infections remains steady until 2021, Russia will face a so-called ""generalized epidemic,"" the foundation warns.An epidemic becomes ""generalized"" when HIV prevalence exceeds one percent in pregnant women nationwide, Pokrovsky said.""This rate now stands at 0.8 percent,"" he said. ""But if it increases, the risk of a serious epidemic is very high."""

The forum had demanded that the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) should provide the free medicines and perform the required tests without any fees in February at the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre set up at the Savitribai Phule General Hospital. According to the civic officials, the ART centre, which was set up in 2013 has since been providing health care to 3,500 patients with HIV. Patients have to undergo various tests before being shifted to the ART treatment regime. The forum, in its letter to the KMC, stated that private hospitals charge anything from Rs 500 to Rs 600 for every test and the total cost of these tests can amount to thousands, which is not affordable for many. HIV is detected through multiple blood tests.V K Suryawanshi, the co-ordinator of ART centre at Savitribai hospital said, ""Once the patient is detected with the presence of HIV, then he or she has to take medicines and undergo regular check-ups life long. We are going to take the help of the forum to get a maximum number patients to ART. The medicines will be provided for free and the pre-ART tests will also done free of any cost.

Delhi grabbed the fourth position with 264 cases.Maharashtra has recorded more than 1,239 such cases over the last six years. While activists are alarmed with the findings, NACO insisted that the data is not a real indicator as it is based on voluntary disclosure by clients at the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC).A senior NACO official told TOI, “The numbers are self-reported. It's not corroborated further by following up with blood tests. The overall situation is actually much better now. In 1999, transfusion transmitted HIV was 15%, which has now come down to less than 1%.“ The official added that the issue of safe blood can be best addressed with an Act that most developed nations have.The Maharashtra State Aids Control Society said that most clients at the ICTC give a history of blood transfusion even if they have indulged in unsafe sex or injecting drugs.“The fact is that at least 90% of HIV transmissions still occur through sexual intercourse,“ said Dr Shobhna Tehra, joint director of the society .A doctor, who has been crusading for safe blood, said that the government has not showed any urgency to bring in advanced tests, such as nuclear acid testing, that cut down the HIV detection window period to six days from three months. “They are risking the life of poor patients. The worst hit are thalassemia patients who have to take regular transfusions,“ said RTI activist Chetan Kothari.Tehra said that the department is working on a proposal for NAT in NACOsupported blood banks in Maharashtra.

60,6,2016,Bad blood: Maharashtra ranks 3rd in HIV cases caused by transfusion,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Bad-blood-Maharashtra-ranks-3rd-in-HIV-cases-caused-by-transfusion/articleshow/52528399.cms,"MUMBAI: As many as 276 people in Maharashtra were infected with HIV while getting a blood transfusion over the last one and half years, ranking the state at a worrisome third position. In an RTI response, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has revealed that 2,234 people across the country got transfused with HIV-infected blood in the same period, raising serious concerns about blood safety. Uttar Pradesh recorded the maximum number of transfusion transmitted HIV cases at 361 followed by Gujarat at 292 cases. Delhi grabbed the fourth position with 264 cases. Maharashtra has recorded more than 1,239 such cases over the last six years. While activists are alarmed with the findings, NACO insisted that the data is not a real indicator as it is based on voluntary disclosure by clients at the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC). A senior NACO official told TOI, “The numbers are self-reported. It’s not corroborated further by following up with blood tests. The overall situation is actually much better now. In 1999, transfusion transmitted HIV was 15%, which has now come down to less than 1%.” The official added that the issue of safe blood can be best addressed with an Act that most developed nations have. The Maharashtra State Aids Control Society said that most clients at the ICTC give a history of blood transfusion even if they have indulged in unsafe sex or injecting drugs. “The fact is that at least 90% of HIV transmissions still occur through sexual intercourse,” said Dr Shobhna Tehra, joint director of the society. A doctor, who has been crusading for safe blood, said that the government has not showed any urgency to bring in advanced tests, such as nuclear acid testing, that cut down the HIV detection window period to six days from three months. “They are risking the life of poor patients. The worst hit are thalassemia patients who have to take regular transfusions,” said RTI activist Chetan Kothari. Tehra said that the department is working on a proposal for NAT in NACO-supported blood banks in Maharashtra."
61,6,2016,"PCR could be a more accurate test for HIV, says NIRRH consultant",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/PCR-could-be-a-more-accurate-test-for-HIV-says-NIRRH-consultant/articleshow/52548380.cms,"Amid concerns of HIV transmission through infected blood, a premier research institute in the city has revealed that they came across two rare cases where the most commonly used HIV test, ELISA, could not detect the virus for up to two years. The finding assumes significance as most blood banks, hospitals and transfusion centres use ELISA as a gold standard to detect HIV. The virus in the two city women could finally be detected using the PCR test that is occasionally used to test HIV. The Parel-based National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) had come across the cases in 2012, when the women were referred from JJ Hospital with a history of co-infection. The revelation comes within days of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) stating that 2,234 people have contracted HIV across the country through transfusion of infected blood in the past one-and-a-half years. In Maharashtra, 276 people have got HIV through infected blood. The point here is not to say that ELISA is unreliable but that there is a possibility of missing out infected bility of missing out infected cases. In both cases, the antibodies did not appear for two years,“ said Dr Atmaram Bandivadekar, consultant at NIRRH. HIV antibodies are generated by the body's immune system when under attack from the virus. Tests like ELISA check for the presence of antibodies to say if a person is infected or not. “Different individuals can take varying time to generate antibodies, but two years is too long,“ he said. Bandivadekar said that PCR could be a more accurate alternative. “This test finds either the RNA of the HIV virus or the HIV DNA in cells infected with the virus. The test can be done within days of exposure as one does not have to worry about the window period,“ he added. In an ELISA test, there is a window period of one to three months depending on whether the technology is from the first or fourth generation. The husbands of both these women were HIV positive and were taking the antiretro viral therapy at JJ Hospital.Doctors at the hospital became curious when the women frequently came with some ailment despite repeatedly testing negative for HIV . They stopped following up with the institute after two years. But staunch ELISA supporters are not willing to write off the test yet. “It has been proved beyond doubt that this test has a low chance of giving a false result after the first few weeks that a person is infected.The world over, it is the first line of screening. If ELISA is negative, other tests are not usually repeated,“ said a microbiologist. Though if ELISA comes positive, the test is repeated to confirm the findings.“PCR may be reliable but it is expensive and needs expertise,“ the doctor added. Bandivadekar felt all blood banks should have the PCR technology. Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director of the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said there are cost and operational issues that have to be considered. An ELISA test in a private lab costs up to Rs 650, whereas a PCR test may cost over Rs 2,500. "

In reality the picture is more shocking. It is said that 70 percent of the AIDS budget is spent on awareness. Where is the money going? It is shameful that even after close to 30 years of the AIDS scourge only 9.4 percent of women are aware about it,"" said Jahnabi Goswami, AIDS activist and the first women in the region to publicly declare her HIV positive status.Even though Assam is categorised as a low HIV prevalence state the annual HIV new infections has risen at an rate of 2.5 percent from 1219 in 2007 to 2408 in 2011. Till 31st December, 2014 a total of 9991 HIV positive cases were detected out of which 3445 were females.States like Bihar and Meghalaya with 10.1 percent and 13.3 percent respectively haven't performed well either when it came to women having comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS.""There is an acute shortage of manpower and resource in the health department overseeing HIV/AIDS scenario in the state. The figure appears shocking and it is not good. It needs serious thinking and introspection to do. There has been an ongoing fund crunch for AIDS from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO),"" said a source at the health department.Till September, 2015 38 percent of HIV positive cases were detected from Kamrup (metro) followed by Cachar, Dibrugarh, Nagaon districts. From Kamrup (metro) district alone 4268 HIV positive cases were detected till September, 30, 2015. The rate of increase in annual new HIV infections is highest in Assam and Tripura. "

For 72 hours, Kulsumbi was nervous and harboured thoughts of committing suicide. She was worried about her family of five young children and her spouse, a tiles labourer who earned very little. The family of Sayad Eqbal Ahmed Jamadar heaved a sigh of relief after a second medical test conducted three days later - at a government hospital - said she is in the clear. Sharing the trauma of those three days, Sayad Eqbal Ahmed Jamadar said his wife had a growth on her hand and a government doctor suggested she undergo a routine blood test to ascertain if she has any vitamin deficiency. The worried couple went to a private lab in Haveri on Monda. Thanks to a mix-up by the lab, the woman received a report that declared her HIV positive. The Jamadar family was too shocked to rush to another lab for a second test. ""I was traumatized and found it extremely difficult to convince my wife that we can seek a second opinion. She was depressed, spoke of committing suicide by hanging as she didn't want to live with the stigma of HIV. I made several attempts to keep hope,"" Sayad pointed out. That was when the couple decided to seek the counsel of family friend Khader. He suggested an immediate second test and reprimanded Jamadar's wife for contemplating suicide based on ""a random test"". Jamadar said: ""On Khader's advice, we went to the Haveri government hospital on Wednesday for a test, this time to rule out presence of HIV in her bloodstream. To our great relief, she tested negative for HIV. We are extremely happy, and equally angry with the private lab for the costly blooper."" The family brought the issue to the district health officer's notice, seeking action against the lab. When Jamadar confronted laboratory officials, they admitted to the lapse and claimed a faulty medical kit would have thrown the HIV result in a routine blood test. He is contemplating filing a case against the lab. Haveri district surgeon Mahesh Badni blamed the lab for the horrendous mix-up. District health officer Sunil Chandra Avaradi held the lab responsible for the goof-up, and said no hospital or medical facility informs a patient of HIV test results. He said his department will conduct a probe into the incident and punish the guilty. A technician from the Haveri lab who didn't wish to be identified apologized for the mistake."

She went through the mandatory blood tests before surgery and everything was fine barring a low haemoglobin level. A blood transfusion done at the hospital to improve her platelet count, however, changed the course of her life for the worse.Though she was not operated upon in that period, she was given one unit of blood and asked to come back in five days by which time the Hb percentage was expected to improve. What followed came as a total shock. Subsequently, when Gowri came back for admission and after another round of blood tests, the results said: Reactive to HIV 1. And the interpretation was screaming: ""The above sample was repeatedly reactive for HIV I and II antibodies by three different test methods and therefore positive for HIV as per NACO guidelines.""The family was caught unawares. Not even a week prior to this second blood test, her sample showed HIV negative, in the same laboratory, of the same hospital. The hospital, which denied the allegations, reportedly told the family that Gowri was already infected before she came to them. It's been two years since her diagnosis and Gowri is on medication; her family has approached the Karnataka Medical Council and is fighting a case in the magistrate's court. The issue was brought before the state health department, and a committee was formed, but it did not see any action. A petition moved by V S Ugrappa, chairman of the expert committee on preventing sexual violence against women and children, has set the ball rolling with the police taking up the case.The complaint was filed recently at Sadashivnagar police station against the hospital, a gynaecologist, and two employees of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center for cognisable offence of ""forgery with medical records and medical negligence"".""It is submitted that the accused hospital is involved in gross medical negligence by causing HIV infection via contaminated blood transfusion. Thereafter, the accused have tampered with the medical records to cover up the crime. The chain of events shows that within all human probability, the offence of forgery of medical records to conceal evidence of medical negligence. This complaint may be specially taken in record and speedily acted upon, because of the gravity of the crime, the maneuvers of the other side to hush up matters and cause great harm to me and my family,'' the complaint has stated.The major offences recorded are: Forgery of medical record (IPC section 466); cheating (420); forgery (463), making a false document (464). Subsequently, the police have taken up an FIR and investigations are on -- they are examining the medical records and have questioned the hospital staff and the doctor.Documents show that on February 13, 2014, Gowri was admitted to the hospital and discharged on the 15th. Her discharge summary says that her Hb% is 7.5m, platelet count 2.29; VDRL, HIV I &amp; II negative and one unit of blood transfusion was advised. Accordingly, on the 14th, one unit (300 ml of RBC) was given (blood unit number 17093 for which the family has the record) and on the 15th she was discharged and asked to come back on the 19th.Subsequently, on February 19, Gowri was again admitted and the same set of blood tests were carried out. And this time the results were: Hb% 10.2, platelet count 2.23 and HIV I &amp; II negative (in fact it is very unclear and looks like a scribble). The discharge summary read: ""Patient came with the above mentioned complaints, diagnosed to be Retro Positive and counseling done. Hence discharged on February 22.'' Surprisingly, the blood unit number was changed to 12093 in the hospital records.The patient gave another sample for testing at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center on February 24 which also showed her positive for HIV. Intriguingly, the same Center has another record to show that on February 12, Gowri's sample was tested and came back HIV positive. But the catch is that Gowri was admitted to MS Ramaiah only on February 13, hence where did this blood test come from. The family sees something amiss. ""This is a fraudulent document. When my sister was admitted on 13th and her blood sample drawn for testing at MS Ramaiah, why would she go for blood tests on the 12th? This document was created subsequently to show that the patient was infected before she was admitted. But the hospital's first discharge summary says that the blood tests are negative for HIV. This has to be investigated thoroughly,'' said the patient's husband Rajanna (name changed).MS Ramaiah Hospital termed the issue an ""allegation"" and its chief administrator Dr V Narendranath, who did not want to divulge much on the case, said, ""It is in court and it is sub judice. We will respond to the court and give a reply to the appropriate authority. We respect our patients and we cannot divulge the patient's medical history. We will not breach the patient's confidentiality at any cost."" Expressing his resentment over the police ""harassing the doctors and para-medical staff for four days"", Dr Narendranath says: ""Why is this a criminal case? These days, hospitals have become a soft target. Every patient has a right to express his/her grievance and somebody has to decide what is right and what is wrong."" Why the mess?For a start, MS Ramaiah Hospital doesn't come under the state government's Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID-NAT) project where blood is tested at the highest standard. The normal process followed for testing of donated blood in private blood banks in hospitals is the Elisa test, which detects Hepatitis B and C and HIV for antigens and antibodies. However, under ID-NAT, the blood sample is tested for HIV, HBV (Hepatitis B) and HCV (Hepatitis C) to detect direct Ribo Nucleic Acid and DNA of the virus. All government hospital bloodbanks and Rotary-TTK are a part of this project where donated blood is mandatorily tested by ID-NAT. This test is done at Bowring Hospital, the only certified blood testing facility.According to specialists, a virus, after entering the bloodstream, has a window period and only after that can the antigens or antibodies be detected. HIV has a lower window period than HBV or HCV -- around 15-20 days. In case an HIV-infected person donates blood and the window period is just four to five days, the virus will go undetected and there is a fair chance that it could infect the person undergoing the blood transfusion."

71,7,2016,City docs transplant liver into HIV+ man,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/City-docs-transplant-liver-into-HIV-man/articleshow/53245446.cms,"New Delhi: In a rare surgery, doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital recently performed a liver transplant on an HIV positive person. The patient, a 45-year-old man from northeast, has been living with HIV since 2003. He contracted Hepatitis C leading to liver failure. The family of the patient said the local hospitals they approached had given up, saying there was no cure for this complex condition. So, they rushed him to Delhi where the transplant was carried out.“It took us over 10 hours to carry out the life-saving procedure. We had to be very careful not to catch the infection. At the same time, we had to ensure that the patient didn’t contract any infection post transplant,” said Dr Naimish Mehta, senior liver transplant surgeon at SGRH. He said HIV patients are generally not taken up for major surgeries, particularly transplants, because they are immune-compromised. “In this case, for example, the patient had both HIV and Hepatitis C, which compromised his immunity significantly. Additionally, we had to suppress his immune system post transplant to ensure that the body doesn’t reject the new liver,” Mehta said. The liver transplant surgeon added that this was a huge challenge for them and any misstep could have proved fatal.The liver transplant surgeon said both the donor and the recipient were doing well. In India, 2.1 million people are living with HIV and Hepatitis C virus co-infection, said Dr Anil Arora, chairman, department of gastroenterology at the hospital. He added that initially HIV infection was considered an absolute contraindication for organ transplants because of concerns about disease progression. However, with recent advances in retro-viral therapy for HIV and treatment for Hepatitis C virus infection, complex procedures, including transplants, can be carried out, the doctor added.The US Congress recently passed HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE Act), which allows organ donation between HIV positive individuals. “The prevalence of liver disease in patients with HIV is higher than that of the general population, as are the morbidity and mortality. But with successful transplant, it is possible to give them a new life,” Arora added.According to the doctor, in India, the biggest hurdle for patients suffering from HIV is the stigma associated with this disease. In many areas, HIV positive people are considered social outcasts. Worse, they are turned away by many hospitals too. “In spite of medical advances, these patients find themselves condemned for life,” said another senior doctor at Gangaram hospital."

""They seem to have a tiff with neighbours and I have advised panchayat leaders to sensitise them about HIV,"" he added.The block development officer, A Venketesan, denied the allegation, saying that they have just begun providing water connections. ""That we did not give their house water connection because of their HIV status is false,"" said Venketesan. ""The entire locality uses tap water and we are in the process of covering all households with pipelines. We have sent orders for him (Radhakrishnan) to be given the connection on Monday morning on a special case,"" he said. Trouble for the couple and their two daughters dates back to in the neighbourhood in 2011 when their thatched house was set on fire. and they along with their two daughters escaped with minor injuries. Radhakrishnan had then filed a complaint with police against the former Thirumani panchayat president, late V Rajagopal, who wanted the family to vacate the village because of the couple's HIV-positive status. Chengalpet police had registered a case of attempt to murder.Radhakrishnan had said that the miscreants had locked the house from outside and set fire to it at 2.30 am because he refused to listen to village leaders' diktat that they go away from the village. Radhakrishnan, 45 was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1995. ""The former panchayat leader had put us through a lot of problems but we protested and built our own house and stayed here,"" he says.Activists in the state say that the government's campaign to sensitise people to HIV has fizzled out. ""There has been no effort over the last three years to address stigma and discrimination associated with HIV,"" says Krishnagiri-based G Karunanidhi, founder, HIV Positive Network. ""There is no budget allocated for support and care."""

The NGOs are now facing difficulties in arranging community meetings of patients as the staff does not have funds to provide them food or medicines.""Our NGO is taking care of around 2,100 HIV positive patients under three different projects. We have not received a penny since April. The conditions were bad since the past 18 months, but have become worse now. We are facing troubles paying salaries to our staff. The staff members are the only point of contact for HIV positive patients.

""Funds for aids prevention project largely come from international agencies, which has declined in the past three years. It has affected budgeting of the programme across the country. The funding has almost halved,"" sources added.The dearth of funding in Kolhapur was reflected on Tuesday when collector Saini praised the district-level aids prevention and control unit for continuing the work despite lack of money. Last year, Saini had made successful efforts to get Rs 25.88 lakh approved from the district planning and development council for the aids control unit.Admitting to shortage of funds, Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer of the Kolhapur unit, said her office is trying to ensure atleast basic medicines and condoms for the patients using the funds received till March this year.

76,7,2016,Hepatitis: A disease that's deadlier than HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Hepatitis-A-disease-thats-deadlier-than-HIV/articleshow/53427388.cms,"We all know enough about HIV yet it remains one of the most dreaded diseases across the globe; yet another HIV-like disease, which is a time bomb waiting to explode goes unnoticed by many. Introducing Hepatitis, a viral infection that affects the liver and is a leading cause of death and disability across the world. The disease is backed by some startling facts. A recent study published in The Lancet journal stated that viral hepatitis deaths increased by 63 per cent in the last 23 years. For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Hepatitis A and E are waterborne; Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted by bodily fluids (via syringes, needles, injections, toothbrush, razors). Furthermore, all of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Dr. Ajay P Choksi, Consultant and Head, Dept. of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai explains, ""Hepatitis A and E are generally self limiting and don't normally last beyond six months. However, they can be severe, incapacitating and fatal during this period. Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HBC), on the other hand, can give rise to acute illnesses like A (HBA) and E (HBE) but can also cause chronic liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis of liver or even cancer of liver. Hepatitis D (HBD) infection occurs only if a person has Hepatitis B."" Shockingly, there have been a surge in deaths in the past 20 years. ""Despite alarming statistics, we as a country have not undertaken enough clinical research. Of the five, there is no cure for three of them. Hepatitis C alone affects estimated 12 million people in India, most of whom don't even know they are carriers. The combined burden of viral hepatitis is huge in India. We need treatment regimens that are short and therapies that are effective, affordable and well-tolerated,"" shares Suneela Thatte, President, Indian Society of Clinical Research (ISCR). World Health Organisation has stated that a shocking 95 per cent of people infected with Hepatitis B or C do not even know they are infected and often live without symptoms for a long time. This year alone, 10 to 30 million people will be infected with HBV. Dr Harshwardhan Dongre, K J Somaiya Hospital warns, ""Currently there is no treatment for acute Hepatitis B infection. Progression to chronic disease depends on a host of factors, so preventing acute infection is the only preventive measure available."" Dr. PM Bhujang – President, Association of Hospitals adds, ""Acute infection may present as fever, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and dark urine. Chronic hepatitis may present with early and late symptoms of liver dysfunction and failure."" Unlike Hepatitis B, C and D, Hepatitis A and E do not damage the liver in the long term. ""Once infected or vaccinated, we do not get the infection again,"" adds Dr Vasudevan K R, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation department, Jaypee Hospital, Noida.Prevention plan Most of the viral hepatitis have vaccinations and so the first plan should be to get yourself duly immunized against them. Follow the below guidelines: - Avoid sharing sharp objects for example, needles, razor and toothbrush. - Avoid unprotected sex. - Three dosages of hepatitis B vaccine given at intervals of 0-1-6 months would give immunity against Hepatitis B at more than 95% probability. - All infants should be immunised against hepatitis B in 1st year of life. - All pregnant ladies should be screened for hepatitis B &amp; C and if found positive, adequate measures should be taken to prevent transmission. - No open wound should be contacted without gloves.Facts and myths Dr. Neeraj Saraf, Associate Director - Hepatology, Medanta - The Medicity lays busts some common myths Myths and facts of Hepatitis BMyths: People infected with viral hepatitis B never recover.Facts: Ninety percent of infected adults with acute hepatitis B can recover without any problems, but most infected babies and children eventually develop chronic hepatitis B infection, where recovery is not possible. New antiviral treatments may reduce the incidence of complications by suppressing the virus and preventing progression of the disease. Myths: Viral Hepatitis B cannot be prevented.Facts: The Viral Hepatitis B vaccine is absolutely safe and extremely effective. It only takes 3 shots to protect against viral hepatitis B. Myths and facts of Hepatitis CMyths: You’ve been vaccinated for Hepatitis CFacts: No vaccine currently exists for hepatitis C therefore you cannot be vaccinated for hepatitis C. Myth: It is not curableFacts: Hepatitis C is almost 100 per cent curable with the help of the excellent drugs that are available "

Principal health secretary Sujata Saunik said that the National Centre for Disease Control in 2014 had designed guidelines for safe injection practices, which the state has decided to adopt now.“The first step would be to transition from disposable to single use auto-disable syringes in the immunization programme so that any likelihood of syringe reuse is ruled out,” Saunik said on the sidelines of a WHO event on Hepatitis Day on Thursday. “It will be complemented by extensive awareness about birth vaccination, training of healthcare workers on handling and maintenance of drugs and safe disposal of syringes.

79,7,2016,74% male sex workers in Chennai at risk of HIV: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/74-male-sex-workers-in-Chennai-at-risk-of-HIV-Study/articleshow/53444550.cms,"They are told their orientation is unnatural, their profession criminal and their existence precarious yet outreach programmes for them are minimal. Although male sex workers (MSWs) come under the high-risk category under HIV intervention programmes, their names rarely make it to the list. The result is more than 25 years after the initiation of the country's AIDS control programme, most of them continue to engage in unsafe sex. A study by a group of researchers from institutes across the world, including the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), Chennai, has found that 74.2% of the MSWs they surveyed accepted more money from their clients to not use a condom. The study, recently published in AIDS Care, took into account experiences of 100 male sex workers around the age of 25 years in the city. Beena Thomas, an NIRT scientist, who was part of the research, said at least three-fourth of the subjects surveyed expressed difficulty in convincing their clients to use condoms. “They find it hard to negotiate. And if sex work is their only source of income, it is likely that they agree to go forward without protection as the clients pay more,“ she said. The subjects said they earned between `2,000 and `8,000 a month. Although male sex workers are at a higher risk of contracting HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), they remain understudied compared to their female peers. Experts attribute this to the stigma attached not just to sex work, but their sexual orientation as well. The study also noted that only 64% of them reported ever testing for HIV. Dr Sundar Sundararaman, a physician who has worked with HIV patients for the past 30 years, isn't surprised by these figures. He said while HIV intervention programmes have listed transgender, women sex workers and homosexual men under the high-risk category, they are yet to recognize male sex workers as an exclusive group. “Male sex workers are not identified and so they aren't in the ambit of service delivery ,“ he said, advocating changes at the policy level. He said financial incentives for riskier sexual behaviour, coupled with lack of access to prevention services, increased prevalence of HIV and STIs among MSWs compared to broader population of men having sex with men. The study also noted that more than half of the subjects did not know the HIV status of their most recent client. As believed, it is not just women sex workers who face abuse. Researchers found 60% of the MSWs faced verbal abuse and 40% were physically assaulted. Those who financially depended only on sex work were far more vulnerable and likely to report abuse. Dr Vijaya Raman of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative said the numbers were alarming and urgent steps needed to be taken for intervention programmes to reach this group. “Our outreach programmes need to be revamped. This is an evolving sector. Previously , they operated in groups, now many of them work individually through the internet, which gives them anonymity,“ he said. The study threw another surprise highlighting the need to identify this group -nearly 72% said they wanted to continue sex work. “This being the case, HIV prevention interventions shouldn't try to draw MSWs away but focus on facilitating skills that will support their ability to negotiate sexual safety,“ said Thomas.

To make sure you don't miss any, here is this week's aggregation of the latest news stories on health, fitness and diet. Hepatitis: Everything you need to know in 3 minutes or less One of the main challenges to addressing hepatitis is that 95 per cent of people with chronic hepatitis do not know they are infected and less than one per cent have access to treatment, states WHO. Govt. to declare malaria notifiable disease soon At present, cases being treated at public hospitals are only taken into account to assess the disease burden. Putting every case on record is a crucial challenge in eliminating malaria which the country aims to achieve by 2030. This herbal combo packs powerful punch against colon cancer Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, which is present in spicy curry dishes, and silymarin is a component of milk thistle, which has been used to treat liver disease. Kolkata most vulnerable as allergy tentacles tighten grip ""India has witnessed a 20% rise in allergies in the past five years, and the spike can be a direct fallout of our changing lifestyle that takes us away from trees and farmland. ""Another type of Zika-transmitting mosquito discovered Brazilian scientists have identified another type of Zika-transmitting mosquito, responsible for over 1,700 cases of microcephaly in newborns in the South American country since October 2015.

Not a 'healthy' idea to have chicken at roadside eateries ""At least 70% common gastroenterological infections may be associated with eating out. When we ask patients about what they ate last, the most common answer is non-vegetarian food at an eating joint"" Toxic bacteria found in seafood samples Over the past one year, around 123 samples of fish were taken and analyzed at the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), which is a nationally-accredited agency by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for testing the quality of fish. Dirty water stunts millions of Indian children: Study Despite high economic growth in recent years, India has more stunted children than Nigeria, Pakistan, China and the Republic of Congo combined. Hepatitis: A disease that's deadlier than HIV For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Beware of tattoos, reused needles can cause Hepatitis C Recently, a 26-year-old techie was referred to Manipal Hospitals after a master check-up elsewhere showed his liver enzymes were alarmingly high. Blood test revealed the youth was suffering from Hepatitis C infection. There is antibiotic hiding out in people's noses Scientists in Germany have discovered a bacteria hiding out in peoples' noses that produces an antibiotic compound that can kill several dangerous pathogens, including the superbug MRSA. WHO alert - 52m hepatitis cases a burden on India This is placing a huge disease, social and economic burden on the affected families as well as the health system, the UN agency said. After-hours email expectations taking toll on employee health Responding to work emails after work hours may seem like an increase in productivity, but it turns out, it is negatively impacting employee well-being. Alcohol causes seven types of cancer: Study Excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to seven forms of cancer, and individuals consuming even low to moderate amounts are at risk, says a review. Sleep with chicken around bed and avoid malaria! A study done by scientists from Ethopia and Sweden has claimed that mosquitoes are repelled by the smell of chickens. New forms of HIV can jump from animals to humans The suggestion stems from a study in which the scientists discovered the first in vivo evidence that strains of chimpanzee-carried simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that virologists consider the ancestor of HIV can infect human cells. Drug combo may help fight antibiotic resistance Researchers have found that combinations of three different antibiotics can help overcome bacteria's resistance to antibiotics, even when none of the three antibiotics on their own, or even two of the three together, is effective. Researchers find way to prevent damage in donated kidneys Researchers have identified a panel of genes which can help predict whether a transplanted kidney will later develop fibrosis -- a condition which can cause the organ to fail. New compound may help fight epilepsy Researchers from Louisiana State University in the US, discovered and patented the compounds known as LAU that prevented the seizures and their damaging effects on dendritic spines in an experimental model of epilepsy in mice. Genetic switch identified to prevent asthma If successful, it's hoped that the advance could stop it at the origin of the disease. Remote-controlled microbots to soon aid doctors To better treat a variety of diseases, researchers have developed soft, flexible and motor-less microrobots that can be remotely controlled with electromagnetic fields. Zika risk at Rio Olympics 'low' In a worst-case scenario, an estimated 3 to 37 of the thousands of athletes, spectators, media and vendors traveling to Rio for the Olympics will bring the Zika virus back to their home countries, the researchers at Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) concluded. More than 90m people may get Zika over next few years As many as 93 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean, including 1.6 million childbearing women, are at risk of catching the Zika virus before the epidemic burns out, according to a team of researchers.

The last one year though has been the most trying. “I have been hospitalised nine times over the last 11 months for chest and throat infections. I spent over Rs 3lakh in Pune and Mumbai hospitals before someone pointed out that my HIV drugs were not working. A doctor in the private sector offered to treat me for Rs 4lakh but there was no way I could afford that,” said the patient. Mahesh’s case is rare, but not unusual. In the battle against HIV-AIDS, some have developed resistance to most combinations of drugs used in treatment, either due to poor adherence to the regimen or mutation in the virus. For several such second-line failure patients, their only hope was the international NGO, Médecins Sans Frontières, but that again was an option open to a select few. Now finally, a third, more potent line of treatment has finally been rolled out across 10 hospitals in India, including JJ in Mumbai, Maulana Azad in Delhi, others in Kolkata, Chennai, etc. 18 patients from Maharashtra have been enrolled for this higher grade of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is at least 15 times more expensive than the first-line treatment. The Byculla JJ facility, the nodal centre for HIV treatment in the state, has begun the exercise of screening 2,214 patients who are currently on second-line drugs. Doctors will look for a rapidly swelling viral load in them before concluding that the existing treatment regime is no longer effective to suppress the virus. “Any patient with a viral load of above 10,000 copies/mL will immediately be started on the third-line which will be a combination of Raltegravir (400mg) , Darunavir (600mg) and Ritonavir (100mg),” said Dr Vidya Nagar, nodal officer at JJ. The news that the state-run healthcare network is making available a third and more potent line of drugs has come as a huge relief. “The cost for third-line is at least 15 times more expensive than the first and five to six times more than the second line. Several patients have died only because they could not afford the treatment,” said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. Many were even taking the drugs from the private sector but could not sustain for long. Additional project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, Dr Shrikala Acharya, said the annual cost of the third-line regimen was around Rs 1.5lakh for each patient. Drug resistance is one of the challenges for the HIV/AIDS programme. According to studies, resistance is less than 1% in first-line and 2-3% in the second-line. “We have detected around 60-70 resistant patients across India so far against our estimation of 500. But we have drugs for more than 1,000 patients and we can procure more,” said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer, National Aids Control Organisation. Adult HIV prevalence at the national level has seen a decline from an estimated 0.38% in 2001-03 to 0.26% in 2015. Rise in new infections however has been a major point of concern. In 2015, over 86,000 new infections were detected across India. Resistance poses an additional challenge as treatment failure translates into a high viral load in patients.

They tried to strangle her and eventually, threw her out of the village,"" said Shukla Chakraborty, vice-president, Network for People Living with HIV (NPLH).The situation turned worse on Saturday after the woman visited the NPLH's Barasat office to narrate her plight. ""When she returned from the NPLH office, some villagers asked her to leave the place immediately. After she refused and tried to convince them that her disease was not infectious, they beat her up,"" said a local woman. The victim took refuge at her brother's house in neighbouring Patkhilanpur village. After NPLH members learnt about her plight, they visited her brother's house on Monday and admitted her to Taki hospital. Later, she was shifted to Barasat district hospital.Antara Acharya, district magistrate of North 24-Parganas, said, ""I will look into the matter and make sure a legal action is taken against the guilty."""

The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry investigated associations between infectious diseases and the risk of death by suicide. Researchers studied those aged 15 and above and the infections were divided into categories like bacterial, viral, others and infection type such as sepsis, hepatitis, genital, central nervous system, HIV or AIDS. There were about 8,09,384 (11.2%) individuals hospitalised with infection during follow-up. Among them, 32,683 suicide cases came up, and of those 7,892 (24.1%) individuals had been previously diagnosed with infection during hospitalisation. Study results suggest hospitalisation with infection was linked to a 42% higher risk of suicide death compared to those individuals without infection. Also, the study suggested that more the infections, longer the treatment and higher the apparent risk of death by suicide. "

The hospital authorities on Tuesday set up a five-member panel and ordered an inquiry. ""We have formed a five-member team for inquiry into the allegation following the direction of the district administration,"" chief district medical officer at Ganjam, Manoj Behera, said. ""Further action would be taken only after getting the report from the experts,"" he added. As a part of the inquiry, the team led by additional medical officer Saroj Mishra would verify the records of the blood bank at the hospital and discuss the issue with the parents of the child. The boy, from Sorada area of Ganjam district, has been receiving blood transfusions at the hospital since he was detected with thalassemia when he was less than a year old. So far he has received transfusions at least 71 times with the blood bank at the hospital providing the blood. Of late the child had not been keeping well and it was then that the parents took him for a blood test at a private clinic. There they found out that he has contracted HIV. ""We suspected it could be due to the infusion of infected blood that he contracted the HIV,"" the boy's father complained. He, however, refused to disclose from where he got his son tested.""The inquiry will be revealed all these things,"" hospital superintendent AK Behera said. He said before the infusion of blood to a patient, the sample is tested. ""If we find any infection in the sample, the blood is discarded,"" Behera said. ""There is no chance of the child getting infected blood,"" he claimed. He said the hospital blodd bank does not conduct blood test on the donor or receiver. The superintendent, however, raised doubts over the blood test carried out at the private clinic. "
90,9,2016,85 turn HIV+ due to blood transfusion in last 3 years,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/85-turn-HIV-due-to-blood-transfusion-in-last-3-years/articleshow/53957718.cms,"Mumbai's AIDS control body, in an RTI, has revealed that 85 people were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while getting blood transfusion in the last three years. The numbers, though based on voluntary disclosure of clients visiting HIV testing centres, have raised serious concerns about safety and testing protocols at blood banks in the city. The RTI response by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 18 got HIV through infected blood in 2015-16. The infections more than doubled (42) in 2014-15. In 2013-14, 25 infections were attributed to blood transfusion.The disclosure came as the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) claimed that transfusion-transmitted infections are largely restricted to rural areas with limited medical infrastructure. Government agencies fighting HIV in the city are clueless about the source of the untested blood. “We were told there is no mechanism to trace the source of the infected blood or find out which bank supplied it.It is a worrying situation,“ said Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI. The numbers were collated from integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) at all major public hospitals of the city. MDACS said only a miniscule percentage of HIV cases in the city are caused by infected blood. “The heterosexual route is still responsible for more than 90% infections. Out of the 8,000odd cases detected in the city annually, only 0.02% is attributable to blood transfusion,“ said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS. Activists, however, felt blood banks have a major role to play. “As per rules, when a donor turns out to be HIV positive, heshe must be informed and referred to the centres. But most blood banks don't do it,“ said an employee of a leading blood bank who has been advocating safe blood. He insisted the blood donor, unaware of his status, continues to donate blood. “If he is within the 3-6month window, the ELISA test used to check blood in most banks won't be able to detect the virus,“ he said. Therefore, a huge emphasis should be on pre-donor counselling. “A detailed history of the donor before blood donation, where they are asked open questions about their lifestyles, can significantly bring down infection. But, unfortunately, at most blood camps, it is looked at as a waste of time,“ said Dr Zarine Bharucha, chairperson, Federation of Bombay Blood Banks (FBBB). Dearth of infrastructure and manpower at blood banks are additional challenges. A pathologist told TOI there is a staff shortage at most banks. “Blood is not tested for days or there is shortage of kits. This can lead to false negativity or positivity,“ the doctor said."

But precious time was lost and it was all too late. The woman delivered a stillborn at the Bareilly district hospital here. Doctors said the infant could have been saved had the mother received immediate medical attention. An inquiry has been ordered into the incident.What has added to poignancy of their situation is the fact that both the husband and wife have physical disabilities. Shyam and Reena (not their real names) had got married a year and half back. Shyam, who did odd jobs here and there, then took his new wife to Delhi in search of better opportunities, but Reena soon started falling ill frequently. “Doctors in Delhi informed us that Reena was infected with HIV. We could not afford medical expenses in the capital city and returned to Badaun,” said a teary-eyed Shyam.On Sunday afternoon, Reena was rushed to the district hospital in Badaun with severe labour pangs. But she was reportedly denied treatment by the hospital staff after learning that she was HIV positive.“I requested them repeatedly to treat my wife but they demanded Rs 2,000 to buy gloves for their protection and also asked me to arrange for blood. We were there the whole day and when her condition deteriorated at night, the hospital staff asked us to take her to Bareilly district hospital,” Shyam told TOI on Thursday. “We have lost our child and want the government to take strict action against the hospital staff in Badaun. I do not want other couples like us to suffer the same pain in future,” Shyam said.Chief medical superintendent (CMS) at women’s district hospital of Bareilly, Dr Alka Sharma said, “We immediately attended to the patient here but could not save the child. The woman had an obstructed labour and required an immediate surgery. Had they come to us earlier, the child could have been saved. The condition of the woman is stable now.” Chief medical officer (CMO) at Badaun, Dr Sunil Kumar, said he was aware of the allegations and had ordered a probe into the charges. Additional director, health, Dr Subodh Sharma added, “We have initiated an inquiry. CMO Badaun has been directed to submit a report in this connection.”"

The staff announced that my wife was HIV positive and her delivery could not be facilitated in the CHC. They suggested that we take her to the special AIDS patient ward at Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital in Kanpur.”When family members reasoned with the staff that the woman had been getting prenatal treatment in the CHC for the past seven months, the staff members humiliated them. “Shocked over it, my wife fainted,” Alam said. “We went to the LLR Hospital for delivery. The staff there also did not bother to verify the reports and straight away admitted her in the HIV patient ward, where she delivered a baby,” he said.He alleged that the doctor on duty did not come for the delivery, proper facilities were not available in the labour room and worst of all, the entire staff showed insensitivity in a case demanding care and compassion. The family members said they would apprise CM Akhilesh Yadav and also lodge a complaint on the CM Window."

The NGO Saathi is working across the country to prevent newborn children from getting the virus from their mother. By roping in 50 private hospitals of the city, the NGO has prevented around 150 pregnant women from passing HIV to their foetus. The NGO presented a stall at the first ever two-day women health exhibition of the city ‘Stree Aarogyam’ organized, from Saturday, by the Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society and Women’s wing of Indian Medical Association (IMA), at IMA House. The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), under the Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT) project is providing pregnant women a short-term therapy at district hospitals to prevent the virus gtom getting transmitted to the foetus. Across the country, Saathi has been supporting the initiative by tying up with private hospitals. As soon as the doctor at any hospital detects an HIV-positive pregnant woman, the NGO is called to counsel the women and connect her to the district hospital to get the treatment to prevent her child. Saathi’s local chapter started functioning from 2010. “Until now, we have prevented around 150 newborns from HIV infection,” said programme coordinator Pradeep Marchettiwar. In the absence of a district hospital, the city has three centres which offer treatment, including Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH), Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and the government hospital at Kamptee. During the exhibition, NOGS president Anuradha Ridhorkar said, “Most issues related to women’s health are correlated. At the clinic, it’s not possible for us to counsel every single patient. Through this exhibition, we have formed a common umbrella under which various issues related to women health can be discussed on spot between doctor and patient.” A stall conducted by gynaecologist Dr Kshama Kedar talked about mensuration and hygiene. “Using one sanitary napkin for long hours can cause an infection. But what many girls don’t know is that the same infection is the rising cause of female infertility,” she said. A lot of girls visiting the stalls were told about hygienic measures they should take during their periods. Other stalls were related to issues like HIV, hypertension, AIDS, anaemia, contraception and obesity. "
94,9,2016,Fear of having HIV among the most common phobias in Kolkata,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Fear-of-having-HIV-among-the-most-common-phobias-in-Kolkata/articleshow/54378325.cms,"KOLKATA: A technician’s fatal fall to escape an Alsatian has opened up the discussion on the different kinds of phobias that Kolkatans are suffering from. While fear of dogs, lizards and mathematics are very common, city-based psychiatrists admit to coming across more extreme and sometimes weird cases. From homophobia to scare of having HIV, from worry over not having mobile connectivity to fear of being touched – a large number of Kolkatans are experiencing all of these and even more. Some are even tweaking around with their lifestyle to deal with their fear.A very common phobia that doctors have reported is the fear of having HIV. A small cut in a salon is enough to trigger it. Some of these patients don’t just live with the fear. They even go to the extent of getting HIV tests done. Sometimes, the tests are done repeatedly. Dissatisfied with repeated negative HIV tests, general physicians then refer them to psychiatrists. “They live with this fear despite having done the tests. Some also have similar phobia about having swine flu,” said psychiatrist Dr Jairanjan Ram.Psychiatrist Dr Abir Mukherjee has also come across this phobia. Mukherjee makes a distinction between obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and phobia. According to him persons with OCD experience persistent recurrent intrusive thoughts that might result in them avoiding imaginary situations. They might see a drop of blood on the floor and imagine that somehow they will have HIV from it. “In case of phobia, the person exercises caution in behaviour and might display a tendency to avoid real situations. He might not visit a parlour for fear of ‘contacting’ HIV,” Mukherjee explained, also mentioning cases of patients suffering from fear of mosquito bites and earthquakes.The increasing depending on mobile phones has led to the rise of nomophobia or the fear of no mobile connectivity because of network or battery charge issues. An investment banker from this city recently cut short his four-day vacation for river rafting because there was no mobile connectivity. Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents’ Federation of India, has noticed how this fear among tourists has had them change their travel plans. “Recently parents didn’t give permission to their children to go out camping to a place where there was no mobile connectivity.” Fear of not having WiFi has also gone up.Adding to this list is the pathological fear of contamination and germs or mysophobia. Psychologist Shibhika Singh came across a patient who just didn’t want to touch the doorknobs. “She would wait for someone to offer assistance to help her open the doors. She is undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy to overcome this,” she said.Fear of being touched or haphephobia is an issue with many teenagers. “This often occurs when a child has a history of sexual abuse. I remember a teenager who had turned violent. After some sessions, I found that his violent behaviour was his defence mechanism because he feared anyone touching him. So even a pat on his back was problematic. Later it was detected that as a child his parent would get violent with him and those memories had an impact on his behavioural patterns,” Singh said, adding that she has also come across cases of necrophobia or the fear of losing a dear one to death.Fear of taking flights is common among Kolkatans. Mukherjee recalls a top executive who had come for counselling because he just couldn’t go for air travel. He even missed out on promotions because he couldn’t go for overseas trip. After graded exposure and systematic desensitization, he was able to overcome the fear, fly overseas and get his promotion too. “Agoraphobia is also common,” said Mukherjee. It is an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives the environment to be unsafe with no easy way to get away. “The problem can be so acute that they even fear to go anywhere alone,” Mukherjee added.Homophobia, psychiatrists insist, is also quite common. “Because of this fear, some have even approached me with strange requests to conduct tests to ascertain if they are bisexual or homosexual,” Ram said.But what is even more curious in this city is that many closet homosexuals also display this homophobia. Choreographer Sudarshan Chakraborty remembers one incident at a party where a much-married man was openly abusing homosexuals. “Much later, when I interacted with him on a one-on-one basis, he started flirting with me. Being macho in front of the world was his defence mechanism to announce that he isn’t gay,” Chakraborty said. According to Chakraborty, at least 60 per cent of gay men in Kolkata live dual lives and many among them are homophobes too in public."

While the couple was residing in Ahmedabad, the woman became pregnant following which her blood test was done in which it was revealed that she was HIV positive. Following the disclosure, the husband sent the woman to her parents' house and they bore the expenses of her delivery and medical treatment. The woman, now residing at her parents house since she is unable to maintain herself and her child, sought interim relief, including Rs 37,000 maintenance per month. After hearing both the parties, Thane Judicial Magistrate had earlier ordered the husband to pay Rs 6,000 per month as maintenance to his wife. However, the woman's husband and his parents challenged the magistrate's order which was recently upheld by the court of District Judge P P Jadhav. Judge Jadhav observed that the applicant (woman) is residing with her parents because of refusal by opponents (husband and his family) to allow her to co-habit with them. At this stage, it cannot be ascertained as to how the applicant got infected with HIV.

98,10,2016,British scientists on verge of HIV cure: Report,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/British-scientists-on-verge-of-HIV-cure-Report/articleshow/54642403.cms,"LONDON: British scientists are on the verge of confirming a treatment for HIV, an incurable virus that leads to deadly AIDS disease, if a new treatment trial proves successful, a media report claimed on Sunday.A British man with HIV hopes to become the first in the world to be cured of the disease by using the pioneering new therapy designed to eradicate the virus, 'The Sunday Times' reported.The 44-year-old is the first of 50 people to complete a trial of the ambitious treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from five of Britain's leading universities - universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College London, University College London and King's College London.It is the first therapy created to track down and destroy HIV in every part of the body — including in the dormant cells that evade current treatments.If successful, it offers hope of an irreversible cure for HIV and could save millions of pounds spent on drugs.Early tests show the virus is undetectable in the man's blood.But he will have to wait some months before confirmation on whether the treatment has permanently cleared the disease.It is possible that the absence of the virus could be down to the conventional drugs that he has also been taking which can temporarily clear the body of the disease.Mark Samuels, managing director of the National Institute for Health Research Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure, which set up the medical consortium, told the newspaper: ""This is one of the first serious attempts at a full cure for HIV. We are exploring the real possibility of curing HIV. This is a huge challenge and it's still early days but the progress has been remarkable.""The HIV virus is mostly transmitted by sex. Once in the body it targets T-cells, part of the immune system, splicing itself into their DNA. If the T-cell is active the HIV hijacks it, turning it into a tiny factory spewing millions more viruses to infect other T-cells.It is this aspect of HIV activity that is targeted and suppressed by anti-retroviral therapies (ART). What ART cannot do is pick out the millions of infected T-cells lying dormant around the body -- but waiting to spring into life should ART fail. It is the HIV reservoir in these dormant cells that the research group is targeting.""It would be great if a cure has happened. My last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus. However, that could be the anti-retroviral therapies, so we have to wait to be sure,"" the London-based patient said.The new trial is being backed by the UK's state-funded National Health Service (NHS) because it could save millions by removing the need to treat HIV patients with ART, which costs around 380,000 pounds per person over their lifetime.

Antiretoviral drugs alone are highly effective at stopping the virus from reproducing but do not eradicate the disease, so must be taken for life.The 44-year-old Briton is the first among 50 people to complete a trial of the treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, University College London and King's College. Early tests show no signs of the virus in his blood, the Sunday Times reported. If successful, it offers hope of an irreversible cure for millions of people infected with the virus.But the person will have to wait for some months before confirmation on whether the treatment has permanently cleared the disease. It is possible that the absence of the virus could be down to the conventional drugs that he has also been taking which can temporarily clear the body of the disease. “My last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus,“ the patient said.HIV is able to hide from the immune system in dormant cells where sophisticated testing cannot find it, and therefore resist therapy . The treatment endeavours to trick the virus into emerging from its hiding places and then trigger the body's immune system to recognise it and attack it, an approach that has been called “kick and kill“. The new therapy works in two stages. Firstly ,a vaccine helps the body recognise the HIV-infected cells so it can clear them out. Secondly, a new drug called Vorinostat activates the dormant Tcells so they can be spotted by the immune system."

This puts them at greater risk of HIV.The study, undertaken by a team from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, covered 11,700 men who have sex with men (MSM) in 12 districts, including Chennai. It found that close to 23% of gender non-conforming boys were victimised by older trusted men, which pushed them to engage in HIV-risk behaviour later in life. Epidemiologist Sunil Solomon, who was part of the research, said when the team set out to study the burden of HIV among MSM, several participants they surveyed shared their sexual experiences as children. “What troubled us was that many of them described it as experience, not realizing they were survivors of abuse. They thought it was natural, which only further marginalized them,” said Solomon.A kothi (effeminate man) in Chennai recalled his uncle molesting him when he was three. “I didn't know what he was doing,” the study quoted him as saying. Later in life, he tested positive for HIV. “I didn't tell anyone what happened to me. When they (his family) scold me (for having HIV), I want to say `You should have taken care when I was young. I am alone now'.” According to official estimates, men who have sex with men have a 12-14 times higher prevalence of HIV than other men.The study found that the prevalence of child sexual abuse was higher among ""gender non-conforming men"" than the general population, which also increased their vulnerability to HIV.They found that those who had a history of abuse had approximately 2.5 times more lifetime male sexual partners compared to those without and the HIV prevalence was almost double in the former group.Child sexual abuse in general has been identified as an important predictor of high-risk sexual behaviour later in life for both men and women, including early sexual debut, unprotected sex, multiple partners, and engagement in transactional sex, which increases the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.A study by UNICEF, covering 13 states, found that more than half of children (53%) reported abuse, with the prevalence being higher for boys than girls (53% and 23% respectively).The study found the prevalence of child sexual abuse among the group to be the highest in Tamil Nadu where 43.2% of the participants claimed they were sexually abused, with Coimbatore having the highest at 70.2%. In Chennai, 34.3% said they were abused. Experts say the prevalence is probably high in the south because of better reporting.Child rights and LGBT activists say the study has highlighted the need for more intervention programmes for boys who have been victims of abuse.“While abuse is generally high among children, the prevalence is exceptionally high among gender nonconforming boys. They are already grappling with being different from how the society describes their gender. Abuse just makes things tougher,“ said Dr L Ramakrishnan, country director, SAATHI, an organisation that works on HIV/AIDS."

According to RSACS, the migrating population - local residents working elsewhere and returning home for holidays - is one of the sections vulnerable to HIV. In such camps, organised last year during Diwali, RSACS found that the prevalence of HIV was almost double in villages with high concentration of migrants.The agency found that 0.59% of such population had HIV. All those who tested HIV positive during the screenings were advised to undergo second and third round of confirmatory tests.As per official estimates, 20,037 persons were screened for HIV at 10-day camps organised in 100 villages of 11 districts last year. The villages were identified on the basis of large number of people migrating to other states for work and returning during the festive season.District collector Pali Kumar Pal Gautam said that six places have been identified in Pali for voluntary health camps. These camps will also provide care for those suffering from other diseases.He said that during Diwali people who had gone to other states for work returned to the district for the festival. The camps will also offer other healthcare facilities."

In India too, the government and many private organisations have been working towards ensuring that those with HIV are not discriminated against, and denied the right to a complete life.However, it is clear that these efforts have not percolated deep enough in our state. Children, affected by the disease for no fault of theirs, should not be the victims of discriminatory practices and the government must root them out."

The bill failed to be introduced in the Upper House on Monday because of protests over the government's demonetisation move.There are approximately 21 lakh persons estimated to be living with HIV in India and the percentage of patients receiving anti-retro viral therapy treatment currently stands at a mere 25.82% as against the global percentage of 41%.The key provisions in the bill include establishment of a formal mechanism to probe complaints against those who discriminate against such people. This will allow individuals as well as families that have faced discrimination to go to court against institutions or persons being unfair. The bill also lists various grounds on which discrimination against HIV positive people and those living with them is prohibited. For instance, the list includes the denial, termination, discontinuation or unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property , standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance."

According to a study by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), between January 2015 and May 2016, 127 patients in the state contracted HIV due to inappropriate blood transfusion.Out of 184 licensed blood banks in the state, only 66 are NACO certified for safe blood. Going by the report, Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 371 HIV positive cases triggered through blood transfusion, followed by Gujarat (292), Maharashtra (276), New Delhi (264) and West Bengal (135).Officials at Indian Foundation for Safe Blood (IFSB), an organization that works towards creating awareness about diseases transmitted during blood transfusions, said: “Globally, 15 % of HIV is transmitted through blood transfusions and in India the rate is extremely alarming. In the past five years, 9,000 people in India got affected by HIV due to blood transfusion. In Chhattisgarh blood transfusion has become a major carrier of AIDS. In Jodhpur, 53 kids were tested positive for Hepatitis C after receiving infected blood. Although better than five other states, Karnataka still doesn’t look safe.” Blood transfused without proper checks could result in deadly infections like HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Malaria, Syphilis, Dengue and Chikungunya.Explaining the reasons behind random collection of blood, IFSB officials added: “Often, shortage of blood leads to unhealthy ways of collecting it. Another problem is non-availability of the exact blood group. Also, only a very small percentage of blood is collected through repeat voluntary blood donors, who are the safest donors. Most of the others are first-time donors who are more likely to transmit infections as they aren’t tested in advance. Further, majority of blood is collected through mass blood donation camps which lack proper facilities for screening.”Asked about ways to tackle the problem, another source from IFSB said, “The method of testing needs to improve. The Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) method should be used to detect HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. NAT is conducted in two ways --- Mini Pool Nucleic Acid Testing and Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID NAT). In the first one, blood samples are pooled together for the purpose of testing. However, there’s a disadvantage. Even if one sample contains a virus, the entire batch has to be discarded and each sample tested individually all over again. ID NAT is the best method as it captures the virus itself. Increase in voluntary repeat blood donation, pre-donation health history screening and hemovigilance programme are other ways to address the issue.” ID NAT methodID NAT is a conventional method of testing blood. It requires the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. ID NAT is used to detect the low levels of viral genetic material present in the body. However, it happens before the body begins producing antibodies in response to a virus, enabling detection of a disease early. This method significantly reduces the time between donor exposure to the virus and the appearance of antibodies. This way, it allows for earlier detection of the infection and thereby reduces the possibility of transmission via transfusion. Pvt hospitals to blame According to NACO data, of the 66 NACO-assisted blood banks in Karnataka, 40 are in the government sector and 26 are in NGOs, charitable and voluntary sector, without a single one in the private hospital sector. IFBS officials say Karnataka has already taken steps to curb transmission of infection through blood transfusion and that it’s the only state government in the country to have made ID NAT mandatory in all government blood banks and hospitals. However, this crucial blood safety technique hasn’t been widely adopted by private hospitals in the state.Other affected states.

Detection, followed by shame and ostracization was what he feared.Plagued by many doubts - Will my children get HIV? What if I get weaker and cannot work? Anand is not alone, there are many like him who want such questions answered. Coming to their rescue are a host of startups, which offer hope and promises to improve the manageability of such conditions.Online pharmacists are proving useful to such patients, who have chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, HIV, asthma, cancer as buying online has its plus points like bulk orders, discounts of 15%-20% to manage their daily dependence on drugs.But for patients with HIV, it helps them overcome social stigma, as their purchases remain a secret.“There is no human interface, which is a huge comfort factor to some people. We cater to many remote villages in India and people can order in bulk for three-five months and a discreet package arrives at their doorsteps. We also send out refill reminders two-three weeks ahead of time,” Pradeep Dadha, CEO, Netmeds, which got $50 million in funding from a group of investors, including US-based investment firm OrbiMed and MAPE Advisory. .Apart from pharmacists, telemedicine startups like Rxpress, Karma, Olito, Quadia Technoligies are also helping people with HIV access affordable healthcare from remote, rural locations. “Ostracisation is a huge fear and with the increase of telemedicine platforms, people are able to better access doctors,” said Jagdeep Gambhir, founder of Rajasthan-based Karma Healthcare, which got undisclosed funding from Austria-based Ennovent Impact Investment Holding.“We ensure privacy and boost self-confidence. Apart from medical problems, people also want a morale boost - Will I able to work? Will I grow weaker? What if I had an open wound and used a towel?” said Madhur Gopal, CEO, Rxpress, which has 12,000 registered customers.In rural areas, since patients travel long distances for doctor’s consultations, sometimes there is a gap of 6-7 months before the next visit. “Patients need to be educated on the need for strict medical adherence and the side-effects of anti-retrovirals. Since there is a lot of conflicting information about HIV/AIDS online, patients find it useful that they can come to us,” said Gopal.Many patients confuse HIV with communicable diseases like jaundice and chicken pox. So the around-the-clock availability of doctors is another need. At Pune-based Olito, chief executive Rajesh Kumar Singh said that they get the most number of calls in the night and the early hours of the morning."

The family had to travel more than 100 km from their home in northeast for medication and it was a double whammy when they realized the boy had contracted HIV virus though one such blood transfusion. However, their recent visit to a Bengaluru hospital turned things for the better.Sachin, now aged 10, is cured of thalassemia after he underwent the bone marrow transplant (BMT) five months ago and his six-year-old brother was the donor. Bone marrow transplant on a patient infected with HIV is ridden with risks and the procedure was a huge challenge for the 100-odd team of doctors and para-medical staff at the Majumdar Shaw Cancer Centre. This is, according to the doctor who treated Sachin, is the second successful case in the world and the first in India. The boy hasn’t shown symptoms of HIV for the past five months. “We were devastated to know he was contracted with the deadly virus. We approached many transplant centres, but none of them wanted to even touch him,” said Sachin’s father who finally decided to try his luck in Bengaluru. “When he came, the boy’s immune system was weak and infections were high. I realized that HIV infection could flare up during the transplant. That was the biggest challenge for us. The whole process, including preparing the boy for the surgery, took several weeks. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched with his sibling, making the transplant possible,” Dr Sunil Bhat, senior consultant and head of paediatric haematology, oncology and bone marrow transplant at Mazumdar Shaw Cancer Centre, Narayana Health City. Sachin’s HIV infection is now under control and he no longer needs any blood transfusion, he added.It may be too early to predict, given that the transplant took place just five months ago. But if the boy doesn’t show further symptoms of HIV relapse in the next one year, this procedure can be considered as a possible cure for HIV. There’s no need to worry about HIV transmission between the bone marrow donor and the recipient; the donor is at no risk of contracting HIV in the process.

The situation is no better in Karnataka, with only 21% of the HIV positive transgenders and 33% of the infected female sex workers undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, according to the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS).Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1 (Thursday), TOI found that of the 6,756 HIV-infected female sex workers in the state, only 2,257 are benefitting from anti-retroviral therapy. Similarly, of the 175 transgenders with HIV, only 37 are being treated. This despite the HIV Bill introduced in 2014 — it was amended this year — which makes anti-retroviral therapy (it can enhance longevity) a legal right for all HIV patients.“A recent study conducted by Swasti for the United Nations Development Programme revealed that often doctors refuse to treat individuals from the transgender community. They are either ignored or are shown the door by doctors, who say they don’t know how to treat them,” said Shama Karkal, director, Avahan – Swasti, a health resource centre that works with the transgender community, sex workers and gay men. The study covered transgenders in five states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra.The study showed that even transgenders are hesitant about getting themselves tested for HIV, though hospitals provide the facility. “There is an assumption that only those who are sexually active or sexually promiscuous need to get the test done. Transgenders are judged not only by hospital staff but also their peers,” she added.Highlighting the distress of female sex workers, thoracic surgeon and director of SDS Tuberculosis Research Centre and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Dr Shashidhar Buggi, said: “We cannot expect others to stop discriminating against sex workers if the doctor community itself is biased. The harsh reality is despite being aware of the nature of HIV virus, the medical fraternity often chooses not to treat an infected patient. The stigma is even more deep-rooted when the patient happens to be a sex worker.”Stating that numbers don’t depict the real picture, Dr Buggi explained: “The existence of prevention societies is not enough to bring about a positive change in the health condition of sex workers, as the ground reality is different from what’s there on paper. There is no proper retrieving system in place, with no one to assess the work of these organizations and question their accountability. Most of the cases these organizations record are under-reported.” Demonetization a hindranceThe recent demonetization policy has only added to the plight of transgenders as far as treatment is concerned. “It has become very difficult to meet medical and travel expenses. I recently had to undergo a uterus operation, which was an expensive procedure. The tests and follow-up visits have drilled a hole in my pocket and scrapping of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has only made it worse,” said Usha, an HIV positive transgender.Manta, another transgender who’s a sex worker, said: “I am HIV positive but I have learnt to take care of my health. However, after demonetization, my income has drastically reduced. Either the clients don’t pay or they hand over high denomination notes. Either way, I am left with no money.”Social hierarchy a barrier Another study on transgenders revealed that social hierarchical systems play a major role in deciding which healthcare services an individual can access. Every decision vests with the guru. The study found that 12.3% of the community members opted for informal surgeries conducted by someone from the community or the guru as opposed to formal services provided in hospitals. Any transgender who goes against the guru has to face discrimination "
112,11,2016,HIV+ youth more prone to depression,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/HIV-youth-more-prone-to-depression/articleshow/55693834.cms,"PANAJI: While those afflicted with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) are highly prone to slipping into depression; youth and teenagers are particularly more susceptible to depression if they have no family support. The Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), given free at ART centres of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), is a big succour for persons living HIV, but counsellors and doctors say that counselling them is tough. The level of depression among adolescents and youth is so acute that some have lost their spirit of optimism. An official said HIV-positive youth and teenagers are more likely to lead a depressed life if they have no family support. Sadly, in the case of most of the youth, family ties are missing with one or both parents long dead. The majority are brought up in orphanages. A few are looked after by their extended families. Akash Naik, 23, who was raised in an orphanage since birth — his parents had left him in the hospital after his HIV status came to light — has grown so pessimistic that he refuses to believe that anything positive will happen in his life. The ART staff try to boost his morale by telling him about the research under way to invent new drugs to improve quality of life of persons living with HIV, but Akash’s hopes are long lost. “Akash doesn’t even want to consider a possibility that better drugs that can cure HIV will be invented. He is certain that HIV will not leave him till his death,” a counsellor said. Of the 7,000-odd persons registered with the ART Centre of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, maximum numbers are of those in the reproductive age group, a source said and added that most of them are depressed. Agnelo Lobo, 19, a class XII student, has failed to keep pace with studies. He went into depression after he started developing severe side effects of ART. “Due to the illness he has not been able to concentrate. His mother’s second marriage has further upset him. We have advised him to complete his education through correspondence courses,” the official said pointing out that having to lead life without family support increases the probability of depression. “Once they turn 18, they have nowhere to go. ART lengthens lives and improves quality of life. But, now, the bigger question before them is how to lead a normal life, and that, too, all alone,” he said and added that there has to be some backup plan to enable HIV-positive persons in the reproductive age group to lead a healthy life. For the last few months, Shivanand Azrekar, 25, has been going through bouts of depression. Azrekar is married and has one child and every time he visits the ART centre, the first question he asks the staff is, “how much time do I have?” Despite being put on ART, Azrekar’s condition is deteriorating, the official said. On a positive note, Goa has succeeded in bringing mother-to-child transmission to zero. Also, the ART centre has some help coming its way in treating depressed HIV-positive youth and teenagers. Yuva clinic, a counselling centre, was opened at GMC in October to offer counselling to patients in the age group of 10-19.

The increase in deaths is mainly in the group that has been diagnosed with HIV but is considered too healthy to be started on ART.

The CD4 count is an indicator of how well the body's immune system is working.Globally, patient groups have been demanding that each and every HIV-positive person should be given free ART drugs by their governments.The WHO in 2015 had recommended that all HIV patients should be started on ART irrespective of their CD4 count.

Another NGO member said the programme is going through a lack of motivation and urgency to control the disease.A National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) member said the higher number of deaths could be a result of better tracking mechanisms. Dr Padmaja Keskar, BMC's executive health officer, said: “AIDS deaths often happen due to opportunistic infections and multi-organ failure. They don't happen overnight and the disease manifests over many years. Factors such as nutrition play a pivotal role too.“She added that MDACS is aggressively working towards bringing new infections to zero. “We have to catch and treat them early.“Statistics at the moment do not suggest that is happening: a majority are getting diagnosed between 35 and 49 years. In 2015-16, 44.3% of the fresh infections were in that age bracket, followed by 26.1% cases in 25-34. Overall though, fresh HIV infections have dropped by 55% in the last five years.A Naco official said the Centre is toying with the idea of starting ART for all. “It would entail an additional cost of Rs 100 crore as more than 1.5 lakh people would be added to the regimen. Money is not a problem, but the logistics of procuring the drugs is being looked into,“ he said."

A class XI student, Rihan is HIV positive, an infection he got from his parents who are now long dead. His is a two-pronged struggle. On the one hand, while he fights the infection in his body, on the other he has to battle social ostracism. Gauns is one among the 253 children and adolescents living with HIV in Goa, for whom life is a daily struggle. As they cope up with their life-threatening ailment, they battle virtually everyday with society, which looks on them with suspicion.President of Human Touch, Peter Borges informed that one or both parents of most of these children are dead. Some live with their extended family or with a single parent while some are being raised in orphanage.The HIV status, whether that of a child or an adult, is not revealed, but sometimes it does come out exposing them to discrimination, Borges said. “We managed to stop bullying in Rihan’s case after we approached the school management, but it was a difficult situation nonetheless,” said Peter who added that society should be more accepting of such children, and disease itself. Some of the 253 children living with HIV are in their teens. There are a few who are above 18 years of age, too. Though the government provides a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 to persons living with HIV, Borges said not all are able to avail of the allowance due to bureaucratic hassles. There are five youngsters under his guidance for whom he has arranged a room to stay as they have no family members to rely on. To provide care and support, Goa State NGO forum on HIV/AIDs, comprising of eight NGOs, has analysed the main obstacles facing HIV+ children and charted an action agenda to overcome the same. The biggest challenge before those who are above 18 years of age is what to do next. Some though are completing their education. The NGOs want the government to intervene and help this segment of the society that has been left behind."

Though India currently does not allow HIV self-test, the UN agency’s guidance has even prompted the health ministry here to evaluate the proposal. “We will certainly look at WHO’s recommendations and evaluate how it can be adopted,” said C K Mishra, secretary to the health ministry. The move assumes significance as the lack of HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to reducing the burden of the infection worldwide because it hinders the government and public health agency to offer anti-retroviral therapy or other treatment options to those suffering from the disease. Estimates show around 87% of HIV-infected people in India are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus. Globally, around 40% of all people with HIV or over 14 million remain unaware of their status. Self-testing will be particularly relevant for those people who may find it difficult to access testing in clinical settings and might prefer self-testing as their method of choice. HIV self-test can be done by individuals by using oral fluid or blood-finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results of the test can be seen within 20 minutes or less. Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics. A senior official said, India may initially adopt the UN agency’s suggestions for self-testing among high risk communities where the incidence and chances of spread is higher. “Millions of people with HIV are still missing out on life-saving treatment, which can also prevent HIV transmission to others,” said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general, WHO. In 2015, the total number of people living with HIV in India were estimated at 21.17 lakh, whereas 86,000 new HIV cases were found."

The prohibitive cost of the test device and the lack of manpower to operate it are the factors leading to the delay in NAAT implementation in the state.NAAT, which was approved for use in 2002 by the FDA, can detect HIV infections in blood donors earlier than other screening tests because it detects viral genes rather than antibodies or antigens. The appearance of antibodies, which happens after an infected donor's immune system responds to the virus, requires time. Similarly, detection of antigens also requires time as it needs a higher level of virus to appear in the bloodstream. In both cases, a 'window period' is created during which a donor can be infected but test negative for HIV.On Tuesday, a source told TOI that the state government was ready to start NAAT in government hospitals but would need the Centre's help to install the sophisticated testing device. TOI has learned that in 2015 a proposal had been sent to the state government to make NAAT available in government hospitals and blood banks but not much headway has been made. ""Besides the cost, NAAT requires expert handling. Assam lacks the resources to operate the device,"" said an expert.The NAAT machine costs around Rs 2 to 3 crore."

They want the words “as far as possible'' (with reference to testing facilities and medicines) removed from the Bill.At a meeting held by the Mumbai AIDS Forum, an umbrella organization of NGOs working in the field, on Monday, forum members said they would observe World AIDS Day as “zero activity day“. “The words `as far as possible' included in the Bill's chapter on treatment seem to indicate that the government will have the power or right to decide whether to provide treatment or not,“ said lawyer Nitu Sandhya.“We want the government to delete these words,“ said Poonam Patkar from the Mumbai AIDS Forum, adding that these words were not there in the earlier drafts of the Bill. On Thursday, none of the forum's members will participate in rallies or meetings to observe the day.Eldred Tellis of NGO Sankalp said that HIVAIDS persons needed “full treatment“.“When the World Health Organisation recommended that people with a CD4 count (a blood test) of less than 350 be given antiretroviral therapy, India had fixed a cutoff of 500. Now, the WHO recommends diagnose and treat immediately , but India has only lowered the CD4 cutoff (to seek ART) to 350,'' said Tellis. He added that instead of using CD4 count which is far from accurate, the government should use viral load testing to decide whether patients need higher potency medicines. “But India has only about seven viral load testing centres which are too inadequate for a country with 2 million patients.“"

This comes a day ahead of World AIDS day .Since 2012, Dr Murthy said the blood bank had detected 29 cases where blood screened by ELISA test (a mandatory test for screening donated blood before transfusion) was found infected with HIV , Hepatitis B and C. “This was detected when we ran the blood samples through another advanced blood test called as Nucleic Acid Amplification Technology (NAAT), which is more sensitive than ELISA in detecting transfusion transmitted infections,“ he said, adding that in several cases, newborn children born free of HIV infection got infected after blood transfusion.He said there was a need for a policy rethink on the part of National Aids Control Society (NACO) as NAAT blood test was considered fool-proof in detection of HIV . “The chances of HIV infection through blood transfusion ranges between 0.5% to 3% now,“ he said. According to Dr PSP Dhanunjay , regional manager, Roche Molecular Diagnostics, NAAT test was conducted only at three centres in Hyderabad."

Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54% of the total HIV infected population in India. In most of these cases, the disease was transmitted through parents during birth,“ said infectious disease expert Milind Kulkarni. Today, it is possible to prevent perinatal HIV with effective and sustained use of medica tion.“Most pe ople in India are unaware of this fact but an HIV posi tive mother can give birth to a disease-free child. A number of countries inclu ding Thailand have succeeded in completely eliminating this mode of transmission of HIVAIDS,“ said Kulkarni.He has extensively worked in various research projects of National AIDS Research Institute (NARI).Since HIV is transmitted through blood and blood-related products, transmission from an infected mother to her child can occur at any time during pregnancy.“Putting infected expectant mothers on antiretroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is confirmed is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also given a six-week therapy to combat the threat.This protocol can successfully prevent mother-tochild transmission in most cases. Since breastfeeding can also transmit the HIV virus, infants born to infected mothers are recommended formula milk as a safe alternative to breast milk,“ he explained.Kulkarni said, “If an infected woman strictly follows HIV medication, and ensures her baby receives the required HIV medication for the initial six weeks, the risk of transmission reduces to less than five per cent.““In some cases, a caesarean section can help reduce risk of mother-to-child transmission during delivery,“ Kulkarni said.Infectious diseases expert Amit Dravid said, “India can successfully eliminate mother-to-child transmission with sustained awareness initiatives and counselling to HIV-positive women.“"

A similar trend was seen in the previous two months as well— while 380 missed the September treatment, 395 skipped it in August.“The ART centre provides free medication for 30 days. So, when a patient fails to come to the centre to collect medicines for the next period, they are termed as missing. Ideally, HIV positive patients are not supposed to miss a single dose of medication as it affects their immune system. The medicines suppress the viral load,” said an official from the health centre.A number of patients reportedly miss the treatment because they are unable to travel to the centre. Only 40% are reportedly from the city, while the rest are from far-off places like Panvel and Thane. “A majority are daily-wage earners and find it difficult to travel. Change of job or shifting to a different place are some other reasons,” the official added. Other ART centres are in Raigad areas like Alibaug and Lodhivali.“As on date, there are 109 patients who have stopped taking medicines from the centre. NGOs are notified about such patients and they try to convince them to get back to the treatment. But many a times, the provided contact details are wrong,” said an official from the health department.Talking about the awareness programme, medical health officer, Dr Ramesh Nikam, said that about 25 street plays highlighting the ways in which HIV spreads and the importance of timely treatment will be organized in high-risk areas. “The plays will also spread the message of giving moral support to the patients,” he said.

127,12,2016,Even ‘healthy’ PLHIV can avail ART,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Even-healthy-PLHIV-can-avail-ART/articleshow/55736714.cms,"LUCKNOW: People detected with HIV in their bloodstream can now ask for immediate initiation of the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) now that the health ministry and National AIDS Control Society have done away with the mandatory criteria of CD4. “The new system, followed after recommendation from the World Health Organisation, is in place across all ART centers in India,” said Prof AK Tripathi, head of haematology department, King George’s Medical University that runs UP’s biggest ART center, talking to TOI on World AIDS Day here on Thursday.CD4 count is the estimation of white blood cells in a person’s body. It shows how fit a person’s natural defence system is to fight pathogens, infections and illnesses. While the CD4 count of a healthy person is anything between 500 and 1,500, the count of an HIV-infected person tends to drop below the normal. Since the launch of the National HIV AIDS Control programme in India, it has been the basis for starting ART treatment. Earlier, a person with CD4 of 250 or less was put on ART medicines. This was later revised to 350 to benefit more patients. Those with CD4 count above the range were considered ‘healthy’ and had to wait for their condition to deteriorate for the treatment to start. However, HIV-positive pregnant women, children, people with TB or history of TB or hepatitis B, C and discordant couples were excluded. In 2013, WHO called for a revision of the benchmark and pressed for starting ART even if CD4 count was around the normal range of 500. “It based the move on a number of sub-Saharan, South American and American studies which showed better survival and quality of life if ART was started at CD4 count of 500,” he explained. WHO document on the issue cites a number of advantages of early medication, one of them being that CD4 count remains in the normal range.Experts said UP was a low prevalence but high vulnerability state. As per data from NACO, estimated prevalence of HIV in India in the 15-49 year age group stands at 0.26 % while the prevalence rate for UP in the same age group is 0.12%."

The sole NGO, which is currently working with the MSM (men who have sex with men) population, is involved in a number of programmes, but others say not enough is being done to cover a large migrant population in the city that is potential risk for people in other states.According to Srikant of Society For Service To Voluntary Agencies (SOSVA), the only active NGO currently working among the MSM population, there is a large migrant population and female sex workers who are currently not made aware of HIV/AIDS at the ground level. “The migrant population changes every six to seven months, so there is a constant requirement to raise awareness among them. The risk of HIV is not only limited to them, but also extends to their wives and families when they go back home,” Srikant says.Gurgaon has already recorded 158 cases of HIV till the end of October 2016. The number of cases in 2015 was 184, while the figure stood at 144 and 145 in the 2014 and 2013, respectively, according to the data provided by Haryana State AIDS Control Society’s nodal officer (Gurgaon).According to a statement of the Haryana State AIDS Control Society, the stage IV of NACO was launched in the state with the objective of “consolidating gains of reaching out to hard to reach population with intensity and building bridges over learnt lessons in the light of new challenges of rising vulnerabilities among general population especially less educated females and emerging infection due to unabated migration at the hub of rapid urbanisation and growing industrialisation in major parts of state.”However, according to the NGOs that have been shut down, this is not the case. “The ICTCs (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre) have their limits. They do not work at the ground level. These used to do condom demonstrations and promotion and also used to promote HIV testing. All these have been shut down now,” says Raj Singh, who used to run an NGO to raise HIV awareness among migrant workers in the state.Dr Pramod Kumar, whose work was primarily among the female sex workers (FSW) bemoans the shutting down of his NGO. “One fine day, we got an e-mail and we were asked to shut down, and no reasons were given.” The state, he claims, is not interested in promoting these programmes. “This was clear when they stopped our funding a year ago before we were shut down. Clearly their priorities are different,” he adds.Shikha Garg, who is the ICTC counsellor in Gurgaon, says the results of these NGOs were not satisfactory and therefore they had to be shut down. “They failed to get migrants to come for tests, which is possibly the reason they were closed,” she says.However, Raj Singh disagrees. “There was no complaint, everything was going smoothly. We are still waiting for the government to reinstate us,” he says, hopeful to restart working among the ever increasing migrant population.Dr Vijay Kumar, the nodal officer for the Haryana State AIDS Control Society in Gurgaon, said the changes happened at the state level, “we just work at the implementation level,” he said. Officials at the state level remained unavailable for comment."

From a high of 5,154 HIV affected cases detected in 2010-11, the number fell to 3,129 in 201-16 and has further halved to 1,440 up to October 2017. In case of expecting mothers the numbers slid from a high of 261 in 2010-11 to 153 women who tested positive for HIV virus in 2015-16 and the latest figures up to October 2016 indicate only 85 women were HIV positive .The fall in the HIV positive cases in Thane and Palghar districts is a crucial indicator that the awareness campaign and sensitization programmes organized by the state and voluntary groups in the last 30 years have shown positive results.“The figures are extremely relevant as there is high mobility due to the national and state highways passing through them. The truck drivers and cleaners were notorious to buy cheap sex along the roadside and were potential carriers, passing it on to their wives back home and possibly to their children. However, the awareness drive helped as the HIV positive cases dropped drastically even as the number of people who opted for HIV tests in the recent years rose,’’ said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of DAPCU.He, however, cautioned that though there is an overall decline in positive cases, Thane and Mira-Bhayander top the list of cities where the virus remains a thereat just as it was five years ago.“With 843 people testing positive for HIV virus in 2015-16, Thane, Mira-Bhayandar townships are leading with high count of HIV patients, followed by Navi Mumbai with 710 cases in the same years and 444 and 334 cases detected in Bhiwandi and Ulhasnagar-Kalyan-Dombivli townships. In the present year the situation remains the same,’’ he added."

Out of 537 people infected with HIV, 13 are children below 14 years. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is being given to 3,348 persons in the district at present,” Dr Rao said. In all, 246 persons who tested positive for HIV/AIDS in the district in 2016, are either natives of other districts or neighbouring states. Large number of cases were reported in Mangaluru taluk in 2016 with 152 persons infected with HIV. The department has been taking up several measures to prevent the spread of AIDS through various awareness programmes, he said. A Yakshagana awareness campaign against HIV/AIDS has been launched in the district. Yakshagana shows will be held at 20 places in Mangaluru, Puttur, Belthangady, Bantwal and Sullia taluks till December 10. Meanwhile, Red Ribbon Clubs have been formed in 32 degree colleges and 32 PU colleges in the district to spread awareness against the disease among young generation. Such clubs will function in association with the NSS units of their respective colleges throughout the year. Awareness programmes will also be held in selected 100 high schools in the district, he added. HIV positive cases in Dakshina Kannada district are on the decline as per statistics, Dr Rao said, adding that increased awareness is the main reason for decline in the number of HIV positive cases in the district.

This year’s theme ‘Hands up for HIV prevention’ focussed on prevention of spreading HIV infections, discrimination and AIDS related deaths. “The total number of people living with HIV in India was estimated to be around 2.1 million in 2015. Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54 per cent of the total HIV infected population in India, a bulk of them having been transmitted the disease from their parents at birth. Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV-AIDS is the next major challenge for India, the risk of which can be successfully minimised or even eliminated with effective and sustained use of medication,” said Dr P Haranath, dermatologist from Bhavya Skin Care Centre, Vizag. As per NACO Technical Estimate Report (2015), out of an estimated 29 million annual pregnancies in India, about 35,255 occur in HIV positive pregnant women. This data postulates that in the absence of any intervention, over 10,000 babies infected with HIV are being born every year. According to World Health Organization, without any intervention, transmission rates range from 15 per cent to 45 per cent.“Putting infected expectant mothers on anti-retroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is discovered is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also put on a brief six-week therapy to combat the threat. This protocol can successfully prevent mother-to-child transmission in most cases,” he said. Relentless awareness campaigns and successful use of anti-retroviral therapy has helped India reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS prevalence steadily over the past two decades. India’s new infections were estimated to be at 86,000 in 2015, showing a marked decline by 66% as compared to the year 2000.Visakhapatnam District AIDS Control Society organised an awareness programme on World AIDs Day at the AU Assembly Hall on Thursday. Addressing the gathering on the occasion, vice-chancellor Prof G Nageswara Rao underlined the importance of the awareness and knowledge on the health problems of unprotected sex and the diseases like AIDS. He said students, in particular, should play a vital role on eliminating such social evils from the society for a better and health society by bringing awareness among the masses about the ill effects of the diseases and causes of the disease.Meanwhile, the Medical Department of Waltair Division of East Coast Railway also observed World AIDS Day on Thursday by organizing awareness programmes and taking out a rally to propagate the fall out of the dreaded disease. In the Agency areas, NGO Nature along with Araku Area Hospital and hostels took out a rally and formed a human chain at Araku.World AIDS Day was also observed by Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao Hospitals, Child Foundation of India, OPDSS and Ascent College opposite GVMC Gandhi Statue. Hundreds of college students participated in the event by applying different colours to palms and arms depicting powerful messages such as “Know AIDS: No AIDS, Safe Sex Prevents AIDS, ART Adherence: 75 Years of Life. Students also performed flash mobs on HIV awareness at different places in the city based on the theme.Chief guest of the event, HIV/AIDS expert Padmashri Dr Kutikupala Surya Rao, said as a result of advanced researches in AIDS treatment, now the patients can be given a substantial life and death can be postponed.

Fifty pregnant women were tested HIV positive in the government-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) from April to October this year. Around 1,076 positive cases were found during this period. The number, which JSACS officials believe is only 'the tip of the iceberg', adds to the ever rising HIV cases. As per a National Aids Control Organization (NACO) estimate of 2015, the HIV infections among pregnant women recorded a near three-fold jump from 2010. Around 320 children, including 227 newborns, contracted HIV in their mother's wombs or at later stages. In 2012-13, 235 children, 150 infants, were reported to be HIV positive. Despite Jharkhand being ranked low in HIV cases among children in comparison to Bihar and Odisha, JSACS has reasons to be worried now with the latest data surpassing the records of infected 56 mother-baby pairs of 2013-2014 (56were found to be HIV) and 2012-2013 (36 were found). Though no state level survey on HIV infected children (below 15 years) is available), JSACS estimate say that the number could be anywhere around 3,000. Explaining the steady growth in number, JSACS said most of the women, JSACS said, come from the industrial areas and districts where migration for employment is high. ""However, the numbers can be higher because many of the men who contract the disease outside Jharkhand refuse to get themselves screened. These men in turn transmit the disease to the women,"" a JSACS official said.Approximately 25,000 people are living with HIV in Jharkhand. Dr BB Poddar, additional project director JSACS said the ""timely interventions and awareness campaigns are underway across the state and mining areas and amid truckers"". "

The programme was organised to mark the World AIDS Day (December 1) and raise awareness about the disease. About 500 children, both girls and boys of different age groups are given treatment at the ART centre, deputy programme director (HIV/AIDS) at BHU ART centre, Dr Jaya Chakravarty said. The programme was organised to encourage the children to fight against the disease. Over 15,000 adults (both men and women) are registered with this centre, out of whom 6,000 make regular visit to take medicines. She said that BHU ART centre is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and lone in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Besides being the tertiary centre to provide second and third line drugs, the BHU ART is also a research and training centre. The ART centre was started in March 2005 in BHU and it was upgraded to a centre of excellence (COE) in August, 2009.According to the doctor, if by mistake one acquires this disease, he/she should not lose courage and should get investigated and proper medication. The early diagnosis helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV people can live a productive and healthy life if they take care of health, eating habits and lifestyle. In last one year, over 100 new HIV patients were identified in several high risk areas of the city, said the president of Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV-AIDS. "

The leak, which underscores the vulnerability of electronic medical records, was pointed out by an Australian web security expert who stumbled upon the reports in an open online folder that could be easily seen and downloaded.Tony Hunt shared in his blog that the reports belonging to Health Solutions Pathology Pvt Ltd contained information about “general blood tests to tests for foetal signs of Down syndrome to HIV tests”. He also said the damage could be widespread as the folder had been indexed by Google. “So simply shutting down the site won’t remove the full exposure, Google will need to be scrubbed too,” he wrote. This means that the files could be lurking in the cache folders of search engines. The data was probably lying unsecured for about six months now.The leaked files contained names, ages and gender of patients, besides the tests undergone by them. The laboratory removed the files from the web space on Friday afternoon after a news portal contacted them. Hunt had rued how the laboratory could not be contacted for over two days. “I’ve tried emailing multiple addresses (all bounced) and using the contact form (no reply),” he wrote.HS Pathology Private Ltd issued a statement on Friday saying that their website was “hacked”. The lab said that they were in the process of filing a complaint with the cyber cell of Mumbai police. “We have taken necessary action by deleting all records from the website and it has been shut down temporarily to ensure that none of the private information of any of our patients goes into public domain. While the website has been hacked, none of the confidential information on health issue of any of our patients has been compromised,” said the company’s director, Amit Sharma. The lab has 40 collection centres in Thane, Nashik and Dhule.When TOI spoke to one of the company executives, he said that they were yet to identify the source of the leak. However, it was not the first time the website was being hacked into. “The multiple attempts to breach our site had forced us to migrate to a stronger system. Since our staff was being trained to use the new system, we thought we will complete our processes by January,” said the executive. He added that the reports would usually be mailed to a third party, who took printouts and delivered them to the patients. “That was the only time our data went to another server but we were working on that too,” he said. He said that the data server was in the US. Interestingly, Mumbai police data shows that hacking incidents are on a decline. While there were 43 cases of hacking in 2014, the figure dropped to 26 in 2015 and only 13 cases have been reported so far this year."

To push sex workers and the general public towards safe sex, the government supplied condoms in attractive packs to compete with other condom manufacturing companies.Now, these freely available condoms have prevented many sex workers and their customers from falling prey to HIV. The Society for People’s Action for Development (SPAD), an NGO working for the betterment of sex workers and educating them on avoiding AIDS, distributes 16,000 condoms per month. During the festive season, the number increases to 18,000 per month.According to sources, earlier, due to customers’ reluctance, sex workers would not use government condoms, but now they are in demand.Veerappa Tegur, programme manager, SPAD, said 19 peer educators among sex workers are working to educate the fraternity on safe sex. Nine peer educators in Hubballi and 10 in Dharwad are working in the campaign. “In Hubballi-Dharwad, Alnavar and Kundgol, there are 1,489 sex workers, of which nearly half operate from their homes and the rest in the lodges, market area and the bus terminus. Peer educators provide condoms without fail to sex workers,” he said.There is an adequate supply of condoms, and condoms are supplied every three months based on the requirement. In a day, a sex worker uses five to six condoms, Tegur added.Shaila Doddamani, peer educator, SPAD, said initially sex workers were reluctant, but now they use condoms without any hesitation. Sex workers from the city and rural areas of Hubballi, Dharwad, Davanagere, Haveri, Shiggaon, and Vijayapura are engaged in sex work in Hubballi. “We meet each sex worker personally and convince her to use condoms to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. We provide condoms as per their need and every three months, we take them for clinical check-ups and every six months for speculum test and HIV test,” he said."

This, despite doctors working hard to eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child. Approximately, a third of these women are pregnant. According to the latest statistics, over 3,000 women in Gurugram did not undergo HIV tests till October 2016. Of this, 1,215 pregnant women had been counselled to do so. Till October, 14 cases of pregnant women having HIV have been confirmed. According to doctors, it is possible to eliminate transmission, but only if mothers agree to get tested.Dr Himanshu Batra, head of the department of paediatrics at Columbia Asia hospital said, HIV testing is a part of routine screening at all private hospitals. “All of my patients get tested for HIV, no matter what,” he said. It is not the case everywhere, though. In 2015, 7,700 men were counselled at government-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC), and 6,660 men opted to get tested for HIV. The number is higher in the case of women, where 21,562 women underwent counselling last year, but only 18,449 opted for testing. The gap is 3,113 women. In 2014, this number was 1,600, in 2013, it was 1,005 and in 2012 it was 899. According to Vijay Kumar, the nodal district officer of the AIDS programme run by the Haryana State AIDS Control Society, there are many reasons behind the figures.“Some of them don’t get tested because they don’t want to wait for the long hours of testing (it takes around two hours for an HIV test). Others think they are not at much risk, and therefore drop out of the tests. We cannot force them as it is done only with their consent,” he said.HIV infection can be caused through various means: sexual transmission, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and from mother to child. However, 90% of children with HIV contract it from their parents.According to doctors, a complete cure is possible if detection is early. According to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), its ‘Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission’ services cover only about 47% annual estimated pregnancies in India. In 2015-16, 12.7 million pregnant women accessed this service.A NACO report says the number of women who are counselled anyway covers only 47% of women, making the number of women who do not get tested significantly large. “In such a situation, complete elimination of HIV transmission from mother-to-child appears to be a distant possibility,” it reads."

IMA conducted Elisa test as well as NAT on all 49,000 persons who donated blood to IMA 's blood bank over the past three years. The results showed that eight cases of hepatitis B, one HIV and one case of hepatitis C were not detected by Elisa test. However, it was detected using NAT.“Blood transfusion is a lifesaving procedure. But, there is always minimal risk of transmitting blood-borne infections like HIV , hepatitis B and C from the donor to the recipient. The conventional Elisa test employed in blood banks fail to detect infections in the window period,“ said IMA president Dr M Narayanan. At present, only IMA 's blood bank has NAT facility in the city .While donors in the city welcomed the move, they were concerned about two things: cost and whether it is a ploy by private companies to sell their NAT kit. “Studies have shown that NAT is better than Elisa.Government hospitals have to introduce NAT to popularise it,“ said Jishnu Raj, coordinator, Blood Donors, Kerala.While Elisa test costs around Rs 400, NAT costs Rs 800.Both Elisa and NAT are used to determine if a person has antibodies related to certain infectious conditions. However, there is the issue of window period. Window period is the length of time after infection during which a test has a higher chance of incorrectly reporting the absence of disease (false negative). The window period for antibody tests can range from 3 weeks to 6 months.“Nucleic acid tests typically have shorter window periods, and this means that they can be used more reliably , particularly in cases where the exact point of infection isn't entirely clear,“ said Dr Narayanan.NAT was first introduced between 1999 and 2001 in blood banks across France, Germany , Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Studies showed that countries that introduced NAT have en countered a decrease in residual risk of viral transmissions. Although, other safety measures such as more stringent selection of blood donors have contributed as well; a marked decrease is evident.The residual risk for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission prior to NAT was 0.64 cases per million in France and 3.94 per million in Spain which decreased to 0.1 per million and 2.33 per million respectively after NAT was adopted.HIV NAT yield rates were estimated at 0.3 per million donations in France and Spain as opposed to 0.59 and 2.48 respectively preceding NAT.IMA's move is crucial as India has the second-highest pool of HIV persons estimated at 5.7 million and 3-5% HBV and 1-2% HCV cases reported among a population of almost 1.2 billion. Post-transfusion prevalence of hepatitis has been observed at 1-1.8% for hepatitis B and 0.28-0.5% for hepatitis C and 0.23-0.47 for HIV.“To ensure that blood banks and hospitals shift to NAT, we will soon be conducting a training session for doctors,“ added Dr Narayanan."
140,12,2016,ICTC bags honour for HIV testing,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ICTC-bags-honour-for-HIV-testing/articleshow/55843665.cms,"Vadodara: The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) of microbiology department of Baroda Medical College and SSG Hospital tests the maximum number of suspected HIV patients in the state. The centre has been honoured as ‘Star Achiever’ in category of highest HIV testing load with ICTC-Art linkages in Vatsayan Kendra in medical college category in Gujarat. “This is our fifth trophy in a row. It is a matter of pride for us as we have been bagging this trophy of honour every year from Gujarat State AIDS Control Society.” said Dr Tanuja B Javadekar, professor and head of Department of Microbiology. The Vadodara centre in a year, tests an average of 40,000 samples, with a daily average of 150 samples. “Among the 319 ICTC centres in the state we have been most successful centre in identifying patient. We are handling patients afraid to be even seen at the centre due to stigma. The numbers are an achievement for the counselling team, who work very hard to reduce social prejudice related to the ailment,” she said. The counsellors of the centre – Mahesh Parmar, Yogini Patel and Gita Malaviya – were handed over the award for their extensive work during an award ceremony which was held this time at Palanpur on December 1 to celebrate the World AIDS Day."
141,12,2016,Woman accuses hospital of HIV+ blood transfusion,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-accuses-hospital-of-hiv-blood-transfusion/articleshow/56094708.cms,"BENGALURU: A woman from Ramanagara approached a local court, accusing a Bengaluru-based hospital of injecting her with contaminated blood during an operation in February 2014, resulting in her contracting HIV.Jayanna Nallappa, 40, and her brother, resident of Lakkasandra, approached the court, requesting it to direct police to take action against the hospital. Based on the private complaint register (PCR), Sadashivanagar police took up the case on Tuesday for further investigation.According to the PCR, the patient was admitted to hospital with complaints of infertility in 2013, and underwent a surgery for excision of fibroid in 2014. Prior to the operation, she underwent a couple of blood tests along with an HIV test, on the advise of the treating doctor. The report showed her to be HIV-negative.The patient alleged that after undergoing transfusion of one unit of packed blood cells from an unknown donor at the hospital during the surgery, she was reported to be HIV infected the following day. She has accused the hospital of committing gross medical negligence by violating the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) guide lines and those of blood transfusion.The patient accused hospital authorities, the doctor concerned and the Integrating Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) department of tampering with medical records to cover up evidence of negligence by causing a patient to get HIV infection via blood transfusion.Dr Nandakishor V, chief blood bank in-charge at MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, said: “The patient was HIV-positive before the surgery and before the blood transfusion was done on her.We have all medical reports to prove that she was HIV-infected even before she underwent the blood transfusion.The donor was not infected and we haven't violated any rules of blood transfusion in her case.“"
142,12,2016,Scientists proffer new method to weaken HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/scientists-proffer-new-method-to-weaken-hiv/articleshow/56177081.cms,"Though the symptoms of Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) can be controlled with a cocktail of anti-retroviral drugs, the disease, caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, does not have a permanent cure as yet. The treatment of AIDS, however, has got a major boost with scientists from Bengaluru reporting in a study that if the mutation rate of HIV virus is increased by two to six times, it could become ineffective against its host/human body in 10 years. Lead researcher Narendra Dixit, however, cautions that by increasing the mutation rate, such a person will not get cured, but their findings reveal how long it will take for the virus to become non-infectious, and the disease non-progressive.Some of these drugs to increase the mutation levels are already undergoing clinical trials. According to the researchers, a major advantage of these drugs is that they are not susceptible to drug resistance. Hence, Dixit, who is an associate professor at Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, said that in the coming years, with better drug combinations, the treatment window could be reduced further. Their findings have been reported in “Physical Biology” journal.Scientists have so far failed in their efforts to find a permanent cure as HIV virus mutates or changes rapidly, thus making drugs and potential vaccines ineffective. This implies that by the time a drug tries to make the virus ineffective, another mutant that is resistant to the drug, has already developed. Hence, this latest finding is important because it establishes that a threshold level exists for HIV and the virus loses its potency level if its mutation rate is increased by over six times its current or natural mutation rate.“One reason why researchers have not been successful in their endeavour to find a permanent cure for HIV/AIDS is because of the high rate at which the virus mutates, causing it to overcome the selection pressures imposed by drugs and potential vaccines. From the virus’s point of view, however, there is a flipside to having very high mutation rates. If it increases beyond a tipping point, called error threshold, then it leads to low fitness in the virus population, making it an ineffective pathogen,” said Dixit.Prof Dixit and his team have been studying the process of infection caused by HIV and its evolution using certain computer simulation models in the laboratory, which allow them to closely track the fitness levels of the genetically diverse populations within a host and the factors that contribute to it.The finding also has implications for how we treat AIDS, said the research team. High mutation rates can be induced in HIV using a special class of anti-retroviral drugs. If the mutation rate can be raised to the error threshold, then, in principle, the virus can be prevented from causing progressive infection. This research shows that, in fact, such a benign state can be achieved by using mutation-inducing drugs for a period of about 10 years. For their study, the research team used information from the drugs which are currently under trial. They demonstrated in their simulation model that by administering these drugs for 10 years, the replicating HIV will become harmless. This, according to experts, can be an alternative method or strategy to attacking and eventually killing the virus."
