Ravindra Patil of Yash Foundation, the NGO working with support from Mahindra &amp; Mahindra as part of its corporate social responsibility, said they have come a long way since 2007 in terms of providing nourishment to children living with HIV/AIDS and rehabilitation programmes and opportunities to women living with the disease, especially after they lost their husbands and abandoned by family members. ""Our focus is now on match-making so that the young people living with HIV/AIDS can lead a positive life,"" he said. Rajesh, a mechanical engineer from Mumbai, ""I was 28 when I was diagnosed with AIDS. The world surrounding me changed all of a sudden and I felt that all doors of opportunities were closed for me. Leading a regular life appeared impossible. It was like being confined in a dark room. For couple of years, I struggled to come to terms with the fact and I was losing on health. But it was after I got in touch with the foundation that I realised that there is life beyond HIV/AIDS. Members of foundation helped me find a bride. And life is beautiful once again,"" Starting with enquiries from eight eligible PLHAs (People Living with HIV/AIDS) and converting one into marriage in 2010, the foundation in 2014 received 180 enquiries. Three marriages were solemnised and another eight confirmed. ""After working with children for three years, our focus shifted to the youngsters and hence we started Mangal Maitri, an annual event that brings the prospects together. Considering the figures, 2014 was the best in the past three years. Currently, as 22 youths have found partners for themselves through our organisation. The prospects are bachelors as well as the ones who are in their widowhood,"" Patil said. The first marriage solemnised by the organisation was between the two individuals, whose partners had succumbed to the disease. They both adopted each other with their children and that started off the marriage. ""There are common queries about trying to look for people from the same castes. But there are also others who want to go ahead with life with a suitable person,"" Patil added. Similar is the case of Shankar and Sarita, who got married in 2012. They now have a one-year child. While Shankar works with an engineering firm, Sarita is in the medical field. Both of them acquired the disease from their parents. However, timely monitoring and treatment ensured they being in better health till date. ""I joined the NGO sometime around 2008. I was in college then. I participated voluntarily in programmes organised for the positive people. I eventually came across Sarita, who had registered in the marriage bureau of the NGO. We are from different castes but our parents were for us living together,"" said Shankar. (Names changed to protect identities)"
1,1,2015,Guntur tops the list of HIV positive cases in Andhra Pradesh,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Guntur-tops-the-list-of-HIV-positive-cases-in-Andhra-Pradesh/articleshow/45838621.cms,"HYDERABAD: Guntur district, which forms part of the AP state capital region, tops the list of HIV positive cases in the state. The district also had the dubious distinction of being the ""HIV capital' in undivided Andhra Pradesh in the last two years. If the data available with Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (APSACS) is any indication, Guntur had the highest number of HIV positive cases since 2012-13. Guntur district registered 5,195 (including 2,498 female) HIV positive cases during 2013-2014 and 6,027 cases (2,938 female) during the previous year. Hyderabad, which tops the HIV positive chart in Telangana state, reported 3,952 (2,525 female) cases during 2013-14. APSACS conducts sampling of HIV cases in general population for both men and women, and pregnant women at antenatal care units separately every three months. The data shows that though the number of cases had come down in Guntur and Hyderabad, HIV positive cases have gone up in AP post bifurcation. In AP, East Godavari has the second highest number of HIV positive cases (4,191 in 2013- 2014 and 5,598 cases in 2012-2013). West Godavari with 3,644 cases in 2013-2014 and 3,953 cases in 2012-2013 stands third. Districts Krishna, Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Chittoor, Nalgonda, Nellore, Kadapa, Mahbubnagar, Anantapur, Prakasam, Khammam, Kurnool, Medak, Karimnagar, Rangareddy, Warangal, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Adilabad follow suit. Mahbubnagar tops the list in the number of cases of pregnant women affected by AIDS. Officials attribute the high prevalence in Krishna, Guntur, and East and West Godavari districts to the presence of more number of ports and heavy traffic on national highways. ""Though we are able to convince people that one can live long even after contracting HIV, about 20% of HIV positive cases lose hope and stop taking medicines,"" said an official. APSACS will soon develop district-level societies for AIDS control with single window system for the benefit of patients. Meanwhile, APSACS secured permission from National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) for AP and Telangana units. A separate AIDS control society will be created for T state. APSACS has been faced with fund crunch for the last one year. The allocation from NACO has come down from Rs 158 crore during the last financial year to Rs 121 crore this year. This is due to reduction in fund flow to NACO from international donors. "
2,1,2015,Above half HIV patients in state 'untraceable',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Above-half-HIV-patients-in-state-untraceable/articleshow/45977225.cms,"JAIPUR: At least 25,638 People Living with HIV (PLHIV) registered with Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) are 'untraceable'. As per RSACS, these people are registered at antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres but they are not coming to take their medicine. The figures show that there are 48,202 PLHIV patients registered at 17 ART centres in the state. Since more than half of the registered persons at ART centres are giving treatment a miss, it has become a cause of concern for RSACS. Now, the health department plans to find out the actual status of all the registered PLHIV at the ART centres. RSACS director Dr S S Chauhan said, ""There could be a possibility of many PLHIVs getting them registered at different ART centres. So there is a chance that a single PLHIV can be registered at more than once ART centre. And that could be mean that the number of registered PLHIV is more than actual number. Also, there could be those who shifted to other states and are taking treatment there."" Taking a serious note of the 'untraceable' PLHIV, the RSACS will start a campaign to locate the them by conducting a line listing. An RSACS official said line listing will help them find the actual number of PLHIV, who were once tested positive at the ART centres. The official said they would conduct a survey by visiting the houses of the PLHIV to know the actual position. He said that the survey would help them get the actual PLHIV number and also it would encourage PLHIV to take medicines available at ART centres. He added that few PLHIV do not require medicines so they do not come to ART centres. ""The survey would clear the picture of the patients' status in the state,"" he said."
3,1,2015,"1,000 HIV+ cases in Maharashtra due to infected blood transfusion",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1000-HIV-cases-in-Maharashtra-due-to-infected-blood-transfusion/articleshow/46047954.cms,"MUMBAI: The National Aids Control Organisation, in an RTI response, has revealed that nearly 1,000 people contracted the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus in Maharashtra due to transfusion of infected blood over the past five years. The state has earned the dubious third position after Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat to report this alarming trend, raising a serious question over the quality of blood transfused to unsuspecting patients. The shocking disclosure comes at a time when the HIV-fighting agencies have had people believe that transfusion-transmitted infection has almost been eliminated. The RTI response showed that between April and October 2014, around 629 people across the country, including 80 in the state, got HIV through blood transfusion. The cumulative count for the past five years is 8,983 people who got HIV through blood transfusion in India. The data collected from Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) through voluntary disclosure of clients, though, has raised a storm among the HIV-fighting agencies at the state and the Centre. While officials have questioned its veracity, activists insist the numbers expose the glaring lack of accountability when it comes to ensuring quality of blood supplied by blood banks. Interestingly, nodal agencies such as the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) and the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) have put the onus on each other to ensure blood banks play by the rule and detect every HIV case. Experts say a fundamental problem is the fact that HIV in most blood banks is still tested through enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay test (ELISA) that has an innate shortcoming. “If a person has recently contracted HIV, this test may not show. It can detect HIV antibodies that take a minimum of three months to show in the blood. So if a person donates blood, it will end up getting transfused,” said an ICTC staffer from Parel’s KEM Hospital. “Due to financial constraints, most blood banks have not graduated to advanced tests such as nuclear acid testing (NAT) that cut down the HIV detection window period from few months to a week,” said Vinay Shetty of NGO Think Foundation. Currently, only a handful of the city’s leading private hospitals offer NAT-tested blood, which again comes at a premium fee of at least Rs 1,200 per unit. “None of the state-run and BMC blood banks, however, have this facility,” he said.In an RTI response, has revealed that nearly 1,000 people contracted the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus in Maharashtra due to transfusion of infected blood over the past five years. In fact, there is also a worrying amount of negligence while conducting and then screening blood, said a senior technician from a leading blood bank. “Any person who tests positive for HIV during a donation camp is seldom informed about his status or referred to an ICTC centre, although both are mandatory. Therefore, that person goes about donating several times till he is detected at some point,” said the technician, adding that several youngsters, in fact, bank on blood camps to find out about their status. “Once they do not get follow-up calls, they go about things normally,” he added. Officials from the SBTC, though, feel the numbers are not that bad given that there are 11 lakh donations on an average annually. “How much can we trust voluntary disclosures by people who may be unwilling to disclose how they actually contracted the virus? Also, SBTC’s role is to ensure blood is available for everyone. The infection part is dealt with by MSACS,” said Dr Sanjay Jadhav, director, State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC). MSACS, on the other hand, said it is SBTC that monitors all activities of blood banks. “The information on number of people infected with HIV due to infected blood transfusion is not available with us. There is an option of recording the mode of transmission of HIV for clients being tested at ICTC. However, there are no means to verify this,” said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, project director, MSACS. The bickering between the agencies also highlights how none of them may be actively monitoring the number of HIV infections happening through the transfusion route. According to MSACS data, annual new HIV infections in Maharashtra have reduced from 10,431 in 2007 to 5,893 in 2011 while there has been a 49% decline in AIDS related deaths."
4,1,2015,Bengal NGO shows the way in helping HIV-positive kids,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Bengal-NGO-shows-the-way-in-helping-HIV-positive-kids/articleshow/46048807.cms,"KOLKATA: Mahesh Pramanik (name changed) was all of 12 when Anandaghar, the only home for HIV positive children in West Bengal, took him in. The boy from Midnapore was abandoned by his family after his parents succumbed to AIDS. Today Mahesh is 18. As Mahesh and some other inmates of Anandaghar, run by Organisation for Friends, Energies &amp; Resources (OFFER), step into adulthood, they aspire to stand on their own feet. They hope vocational and skill development training that OFFER has been giving along with formal education could help them earn a living. “We fought the resistance in admitting them in schools because of their ‘HIV positive’ status. In addition, we have also been providing vocational training to older children so that this would help them in future. Our aim is to place them in suitable jobs once they are ready,” says Kallol Ghosh, founder secretary of OFFER. Since 2004, Anandaghar has been taking care of ‘HIV positive’ orphans, unwanted even by their own families. Currently there are 70 such children at the home that provides, apart from food and shelter, education along with clinical care for HIV. But the organization is now staring at a bigger task — rehabilitating the children who are 18 years and above by getting them placement— in a rare initiative to get such children back in mainstream. Bajoria Charitable Foundation (BCF) that has been supporting OFFER is also keen on this rehabilitation project. BCF founder Namit Bajoria, who runs a kitchen appliances chain Kutchina, intends to identify skills in these children and improve them before placing them in jobs. “To begin with, we can place some of them in back office or in outlets in the city. As and when they learn the job they could be given bigger responsibility. The aim is not only financial assistance, but to make these children part of the mainstream society,” says Namit Bajoria. At OFFER these children are being trained at skills like computer operation, bakery and house-keeping etc. OFFER has started approaching corporate houses and other organisations to tie up for the rehabilitation project. But apart from Kutchina and a handful of MNCs, the response has not been very encouraging. The prospect of earning bread and butter on their own is already a reason for excitement for the likes of Pratik Sarkar. The boy, who was rescued from Cooch Behar after being driven out of home five years ago, wishes to join a driving school once he completes 18 years in a few months to earn his living as a driver. There are 17 other children who are nearing 18 years of age and are looking forward to land suitable jobs. “I have my limitations to provide jobs to all of them. But I want to make a beginning so that this will evoke response from like-minded people and organisations,” says Bajoria. Even after these children start earning, OFFER will continue to monitor them, especially their medical care. Most of them are on ART (antiretroviral) drugs and need to maintain a reasonably good CD count to fight the virus. (Names of the HIV positive children have been changed to protect their identities)"
5,1,2015,HIV fears rise over condom shortage in states,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-fears-rise-over-condom-shortage-in-states/articleshow/46060381.cms,"NEW DELHI: At least six states are facing a severe shortage of condoms distributed under the government’s AIDS control programme, giving rise to a public health concern over the risk of HIV infections spreading. These shortages have been continuing for around eight months in states such as Haryana, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh, which have relatively high HIV prevalence. Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan also face a supply crisis, which, sources said, stemmed from bureaucratic delays in procurement. Target intervention groups, which distribute condoms as part of public health programmes, have written to the State AIDS Prevention and Control Society (SACS) and other bodies, urgently seeking supplies, sources said.READ ALSO: Condom safe, but fidelity safest, Harsh Vardhan says The matter was recently raised with the Union health ministry, following which the health secretary met senior officials from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) on Thursday. “The issue has been brought to my notice. We have a meeting again tomorrow where we will analyse the situation and take measures to address the problem,” health secretary Lov Verma told TOI. Sources said the shortage is primarily caused by bureaucratic delays. “While HLL Lifecare is unable to keep up with the demand, negotiations with private players is a long drawn process,” a source said.READ ALSO: Andhra Pradesh tops in condom usage — AP State AIDS Control Society “Several target invention groups working in these states have written to us seeking supplies of condoms as there are shortages. We have reported the matter to the government in our recent meeting,” said Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager at AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) India. AHF, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit organization, provides anti-retroviral medicines and advocacy in 36 countries. The crisis is not limited to condoms. There is also a shortage of HIV testing kits as well as anti-retroviral medicines, mainly pediatric drugs, across the country, health activists working with HIV patients informed. Medecins Sans Frontieres, another leading international group working with HIV/AIDS patients, confirmed the shortages of condoms as well as anti-retroviral drugs and testing kits across many states. These shortages assume significance because India continues to battle against the infection. The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world. India’s AIDS control programme provides free treatment to more than one-third of the country’s 2.1 million HIV/AIDS patients and is the largest in the world. But, with such shortages, the country faces the risk of not only increased prevalence of the disease but also a rise in new infections, experts say. "
6,1,2015,No ready answers to cut HIV infections through blood transfusions,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/No-ready-answers-to-cut-HIV-infections-through-blood-transfusions/articleshow/46060480.cms,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat recorded the country's highest number - 1,658 cases - of transfusion transmitted HIV infections from 2010-11 to 2014-15, says the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). This has raised a serious question about the quality of blood transfused to unsuspecting patients in the state. For many - like the parents of 30-odd thalassaemic children who suffered a double whammy when they got HIV infections after regular transfusions - the figures are a chilling reality. Experts point out that a wide range of factors, including medical negligence, three-month window period of the HIV virus where the virus is not diagnosed by the ELISA test, failed testing mechanisms in public health and wrong information provided by patients, contribute to the high figures of HIV spread through transfusion. ""In the past, complaints of instances of sample pooling for HIV testing have been raised which compromises test results. Since pooling of samples dilutes the viral load of a positive sample, many times it does not get detected and is passed on to a patient,"" a senior microbiologist in Ahmedabad told TOI. The CBI, in its report in the Junagadh case, has said that there was negligence in testing of blood samples and recommended stringent compliance by blood banks. It however did not have evidence to prove a criminal offence. J P Gupta, health commissioner and project director of Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) says there is no foolproof testing method to completely eliminate the HIV virus - which has a three-month window when it is not picked by regular testing - from the public health delivery domain. A petition was moved in the high court for use of the more advanced PCR testing instead of ELISA. The court however said that the issue was better left to experts when it was furnished in court that using the expensive PCR testing can prove detrimental in a public health scenario, and make blood unaffordable to a majority if mandated. Dr Rajendra Gadhvi, joint director GSACS, says Gujarat is the highest voluntary blood donating state - an average of 7-9 lakh blood units are donated annually. He says the figure of 1,685 cases through blood transfusion is arrived at from case histories recorded by patients. ""In India, where sex is still taboo, many patients give an incorrect history to save themselves embarrassment. In many cases, people record transfusion as the cause instead of unsafe sex."" "

John Thansanga, president of FONWIDAPAC, said the NGOs, which used to receive funds from the Mizoram State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), have not received any financial assistance since September last year. Besides running their offices, the NGOs also run homes for patients, clinics and drop-in centres. They distribute condoms among sex workers and syringes among drug addicts. They also organize HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns among high-risk groups and the general public. Due to funds crunch, many NGOs have been compelled to shut their offices and drop-in centres. “We continued our services in spite of lack of funds, but it has become impossible to provide syringes, needles and condoms to high-risk groups now,” Thansanga said, adding that the NGOs have been finding it difficult to pay its workers for months. Chawnglungmuana of SHALOM, another NGO, said the MSACS are not being able to give financial assistance to the NGOs as the state government has not release funds in spite of receiving them from the Centre. “The government is facing acute financial crisis,” Chawnglungmuana said. The Centre is yet to release Rs 820 lakh as utilization certificates for the funds already released have not been provided by the state, he said. The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), which used to transfer funds directly to the state AIDS control societies, recently changed its policy and now transfers funds via the state government."

Larissa Rodrigues, the organizing secretary of the event, said, “It’s been 40 years since the first HIV/AIDS case was discovered, yet people still continue to believe in the myths that surround the disease. Participants from Bihar, Coimbatore, Dharwad, Mumbai, Pune and other parts of the country will share their views on the topic.” Dr Jagdish Cacodkar, president of Indian medical association, Goa, presented a paper on the stigma and discrimination towards people suffering from HIV. He pointed out that more than the disease, the stigma and discrimination of HIV/AIDS spreads the epidemic. He suggested control methods like multi-modal approach from various agencies, legal protection, health education and counseling programs, besides proactive awareness through mass media.

Speaking at a panel discussion on ‘creating an enabling environment’, at a national seminar organized by Goa college of home science, representatives of various institutions expressed the need to spread more awareness for tolerance towards transgenders and PLHIV. Diana Budiyal, a transgender present on the panel, pointed out that even though there are nearly 150 transgenders in Goa, the government has barely made any efforts to recognize them. Lamenting that people continue to live in fear of transgenders for no reason and treat them with hostility, Budiyal said, “Despite being educated, I have faced a lot of problems getting a decent job. Even if I’m quietly waiting for a bus, people will move away from me. Why do they feel so threatened?” Another panelist*, who falls in the category of PLHIV, shared her story of being literally excommunicated from the society. After her husband tested positive for HIV/AIDS, the woman discovered that she had also contracted the infection from him. The couple was eventually disowned by their family. Being a victim of social ostracism, she struggled to get a job until an NGO took her under their wing. “It has been 14 years since I was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and I am still alive. Healthy people fail to realize that we are no different from them,” she said. “Even though efforts are being made to raise awareness about the issue, the process is haphazard and not systematic,” stated Raj Vaidya, chairman of Indian Pharmaceutical Association (IPA-CPD), Goa. He added, “No one has a clear record of which all areas have been covered to raise awareness, or how many people have been reached. The Goa state AIDS control society should be aware of the numbers and a strategic plan should be put into place to spread awareness.” *(name withheld on request)"
10,2,2015,NGO takes up HIV+ outreach worker’s cause,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/NGO-takes-up-HIV-outreach-workers-cause/articleshow/46093168.cms,"LUDHIANA: One of the nine outreach workers designated in Ludhiana at an ICTC (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre) alleged that Dr US Sooch – project officer (Ludhiana), AIDS Control – disclosed her identity in a discriminatory statement to the media on January 31. This issue was brought up by an NGO – Punjab Networking of Positive People Society – actively working against the discrimination with HIV positive people, and for the rights of the affected people, and awareness of AIDS. On behalf of the outreach workers opposing this ‘insensitive’ step of Dr Sooch, the NGO has written letters to Punjab health minister Surjit Kumar Jiyani, Punjab State Human Rights Commission, and the National AIDS Control Society. They will be submitting a memorandum to deputy commissioner of Ludhiana, Rajat Aggarwal, on Monday, demanding legal action against Dr Sooch, and an inquiry into the whole case. Meanwhile, Sooch has denied giving the statement. “I have given no such statement anywhere. I know the rules, and I also know that if I do not follow them, no one else will,” he emphasized. President of the NGO, Jagjit Singh Mann, while talking to ToI, said: “When it comes to keeping the identity of the HIV positive patient confidential, there are very minute things on which people need to focus, otherwise it can lead to discrimination against them in society. Keeping in mind the guidelines, some outreach workers or their family members are supposed to be HIV positive patients. If Dr Sooch knew that the identity of the HIV positive outreach worker was being discussed openly, then he should have been taken care to conceal it. However, until now, none of the staff working with the outreach worker knew that she was HIV positive. But after this disclosure, she is under threat of discrimination at her workplace, and also where she lives.” The NGO also brought to light that there is shortage of technical staff in Ludhiana at many places for the past one year, but there have been no appointments made by the district AIDS control society. Non-technical staff doing HIV tests in CMCH According to present information, both the posts of lab technicians at the ICTC of the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), Ludhiana, are lying vacant for about a year, and the lives of patients getting HIV tests done have been put at stake with non-technical staff doing the tests. It is to be noted that there are nine ICTCs in Ludhiana district – five of them in the villages of Payal, Khanna, Jagraon, Raikot, and Samrala; and four of them in the city at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), Civil Hospital, and two at the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). According to the guidelines of the National AIDS Control Society (NACO), there should be a counsellor, a lab technician, and an outreach worker at an ICTC, who can then refer the HIV positive patient to an ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centre in the city for treatment. NGO head Mann said: “As the lab technician is not available, other non-technical staff are asked to perform the task of technical staff. How can we depend on such lax AIDS control services in the city? The condition is the same at some other ICTCs also, where lab technicians are available.” When Sooch was questioned about this, he told ToI: “We are looking for lab technicians for the two ICTCs at CMCH. Very soon, the appointments will be made.” "

This has left the eight-year-old boy distraught ever since he returned to Gandhinagar after meeting his 15-year-old sister in Surat recently. The teenage girl is sheltered at Janani Dham, which is managed by GSNP+ (Gujarat State Network of People living with HIV+\Aids). The boy was among the 135 children, who had been brought to Janani Dham at Kamrej, 15km from Surat, under the state children consultation programme in December 2014. After two days, the boy had to leave the centre as two HIV+ children of different genders even if they are siblings are not allowed together under The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. The teenage girl told GSNP+ volunteers, “All I have in this world is my little brother and they won’t let him stay in front of my eyes. Why can’t the authorities keep him on the same campus.” Gujarat’s social justice and empowerment minister Ramanlal Vora told TOI, “The law prevents us from keeping them together, even if they are siblings. How can we keep a boy and a girl in the same room?” he asks. GSNP+ president Daxa Patel said, “We have to follow the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. We have an agreement with Samaj Suresksha department which enjoins upon us to provide separate shelter at separate locations for boys and girls.” However, Surat’s Samaj Sureksha officer Geeta Patel said said, “We have shelter for boys in Gandhinagar. The shelter for girls has been set up in Kamrej.” There are 49 girls below the age of 16 at Janani Dham and 50 boys below the age of 16 stay in Gandhinagar shelter set up for them. The state government gives Rs 1,000 per month as grant for each girl. However, the grant is irregular. The 2011 grant was paid in 2014, sources said. A GSNP+ office-bearer said, “Last month, some money was deposited in our account by the state government. We are never fully reimbursed for the expenses that we incur on the girls at the centre.” "
12,2,2015,Smartphone dongle detects HIV in 15 mins,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Smartphone-dongle-detects-HIV-in-15-mins/articleshow/46139250.cms,"WASHINGTON: Researchers have developed a low-cost smartphone dongle that can simultaneously detect HIV and syphilis from a finger prick of blood in just 15 minutes. The device, developed by a team of researchers led by Samuel K Sia, associate %professor at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science, can perform a point-of-care test that simultaneously detects three infectious disease markers. %The device replicates, for the first time, all %mechanical, optical and electronic functions of a lab-based blood test, researchers said. The device performs an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) without requiring any stored energy: all necessary power is drawn from the smartphone. It performs a triplexed immunoassay not currently available in a single test format: HIV antibody, treponemal-specific antibody for syphilis, and non-treponemal antibody for active syphilis infection. The accessory or dongle easily connects to a smartphone or computer and was recently piloted by health care workers in Rwanda who tested whole blood obtained via a finger prick from 96 patients who were enrolling into prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission cli8nics or voluntary counselling and testing centers. ""Our work shows that a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory,"" said Sia. ""Coupling microfluidics with recent advances in consumer electronics can make %certain lab-based diagnostics accessible to %almost any population with access to sm-8%art8phones. This kind of capability can tr8ansform how health care services are de8livered around the world,"" he said. Sia's %team developed the dongle to be small and light enough to fit into one hand. and to run assays on disposable plastic cassettes with pre-loaded reagents, where disease-specific zones provided an objective read-out, much like an ELISA assay. Sia estimates the dongle will have a manufacturing cost of USD 34, much lower than the USD 18,450 that typical ELISA equipment runs. The team made two main innovations to the dongle to achieve low power consumption, a must in places that do not always have electricity. The researchers eliminated the power-consuming electrical pump by using a ""one-push vacuum,"" where a user mechanically activates a negative-pressure chamber to move a sequence of reagents pre-stored on a cassette. The process is durable, requires little user training, and needs no maintenance or additional manufacturing. Sia's team removed the need for a battery by using the audio jack for transmitting power and for data transmission. And, because audio jacks are standardised among smartphones, the dongle can be attached to any compatible smart device in a plug-and-play manner. The research is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. "
13,2,2015,New aggressive form of HIV accelerates AIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/New-aggressive-form-of-HIV-accelerates-AIDS/articleshow/46257776.cms,"LONDON: A new aggressive form of HIV can progress to AIDS in just three years - so rapidly that patients may not even realize they were infected, scientists say. Engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting multiple strains of HIV. Once inside a host, these strains can recombine into a new variant of the virus, researchers said. One such recombinant variant observed in patients in Cuba appears to be much more aggressive than other known forms of HIV, researchers said. Before it can enter human cells, HIV must first anchor itself to them. The virus does this via anchor points, or co-receptors, which are proteins on the cell membrane. In a normal infection, the virus first uses the anchor point CCR5. In many patients, after a number of healthy years, the virus then switches to the anchor point CXCR4. This co-receptor switch coincides with a faster progression to AIDS. Researchers at KU Leuven's Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology in Belgium have described a recombinant form of HIV observed in patients in Cuba that makes this transition much faster. The virus targets the anchor point CXCR4 early after infection, shortening drastically the healthy phase and triggering rapid progression to AIDS. The transition from anchor point CCR5 to CXCR4 is normally very difficult. Researchers suspect that the rapid transition observed in this HIV recombinant occurs as a result of combining fragments from different HIV subtypes. "
14,2,2015,"Not enough HIV kits to test LGBT, sex workers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Not-enough-HIV-kits-to-test-LGBT-sex-workers/articleshow/46307038.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the past one-and-a-half months, there are no HIV testing kits available in Delhi’s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centers. As TOI checked with some counsellors, who carry out these free tests, there is acute shortage of these kits as well as of gloves, syringes and vacuum tubes. Those from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and sex workers are fearful that, since no tests are being conducted, there can be a rise in HIV/AIDS cases among them. 	Ravi, an NGO employee working with gay and bisexual men, says members of this community must go for the tests every six months. “The counsellor at Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital said there are no kits. When we went to Welcome Colony’s ICTC, it was the same. While we were waiting outside the counsellor’s room, two pregnant women got the tests done. When we confronted her, she said that only one kit was available and pregnant women are their priority,” he said. 	At the Kashmere Gate ICTC, Mallika, a transgender, was twice denied the test for the same reason. Herself an activist, Mallika is worried as “convincing transgenders to take the tests is very difficult. Now, with no kits, the disease will only spread. When we asked the counsellors, they said there is shortage at the government level”. Some members of the community are convinced that the government has intentionally pulled the plug from the programme. “My partner and I are experiencing symptoms of HIV. We are both very anxious and now kits aren’t available. I think the government is looking for ways to finish off the community,” Kunal, who went to Hindu Rao Hospital for the test but had to return without it done, said. A counsellor working at Aruna Asaf Ali hospital in Civil Lines confirmed the shortage. “Even if a kit is available, we ask them to get gloves, syringes and vacuum tubes as there is acute shortage,” she said. Since there are no funds, even reports are sometimes given verbally. 	The 92 NGOs associated with the government AIDS awareness programme haven’t been paid for the past seven months and many are now pulling out. Rupika, an NGO worker, is working without salary for eight months. “We want Delhi government to intervene immediately,” she said. The community is now planning to meet chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at one of his Janta Darbars. “If that doesn’t help, we will have to protest outside Delhi secretariat,” a transgender said. "
15,2,2015,Big boost: New drug raises hope for an HIV vaccine,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Big-boost-New-drug-raises-hope-for-an-HIV-vaccine/articleshow/46307096.cms,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a novel drug candidate that may lead to a potent and universally effective HIV vaccine. Researchers found that the new drug candidate blocks every strain of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) that has been isolated from humans or rhesus macaques, including the hardest-to-stop variants. It also protects against much-higher doses of virus than occur in most human transmission and does so for at least eight months after injection. “Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,” said Michael Farzan, from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). When HIV infects a cell, it targets the CD4 lymphocyte, an integral part of the body’s immune system. HIV fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material and transforms the host cell into a HIV manufacturing site. The new study builds on previous discoveries by the Farzan laboratory, which show that a co-receptor called CCR5 contains unusual modifications in its critical HIV-binding region, and that proteins based on this region can be used to prevent infection. Farzan and his team developed the new drug candidate so that it binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing entry of HIV into the host cell. “When antibodies try to mimic the receptor, they touch a lot of other parts of the viral envelope that HIV can change with ease,” said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Gardner, the first author of the study with Lisa M Kattenhorn of Harvard Medical School. The team also leveraged preexisting technology in designing a delivery vehicle - an engineered adeno-associated virus, a small, relatively innocuous virus that causes no disease. Once injected into muscle tissue, like HIV itself, the vehicle turns those cells into “factories” that could produce enough of the new protective protein to last for years, perhaps decades, Farzan said. "
16,2,2015,"New compound may treat HIV, drug-resistant TB",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/New-compound-may-treat-HIV-drug-resistant-TB/articleshow/46376693.cms,"WASHINGTON: Researchers, including one of Indian-origin, have developed a new molecule that may treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and even HIV infection. While standard anti-TB drugs can cure most people of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, improper use of antibiotics has led to new strains of the bacterium resistant to the two most powerful medications, isoniazid and rifampicin. “Multi-drug resistant TB is spreading rapidly in many parts of the world,“ said Vasu Nair, Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar in Drug Discovery in the University of Georgia College of Pharmacy . “There is a tremendous need for new therapies, and we think our laboratory has developed a strong candidate that disrupts fundamental steps in the bacterium's reproduction process,“ said Nair, lead author of the study in the journal Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters. Just like other living organisms, the genetic information contained in M tuberculosis undergoes a complex process known as transcription in which the bacterial enzyme, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RNAP, produces TB RNA. This molecule is involved in processes that produce critical bacterial proteins that the organism needs to survive. Nair and his colleagues said they were surprised to discover through preliminary experiments that the compound also exhibited strong anti-HIV properties, opening the door for dual therapeutic applications. The risk for developing TB is between 26 and 31 times greater in people living with HIV than those without HIV infection. "

Headmaster of the school Fr Jerry Vaz, who was present at the hearing, said that “if any of the students applies to be re-admitted in the next academic year, the school will have no objection to it.” He further clarified that the school will also not publicize the medical records of any of the HIV-affected students. Green Goa Foundation (GGF), a registered public trust, had moved the GHRC over the matter. GGF had brought to the notice of the GHRC that Fatima high school denied admission to 27 children on the grounds that 13 of the children were HIV positive, and subsequently made known to the some members of the public the HIV status of the children. It was the case of the GHRC that “the HIV status of children being admitted to schools is irrelevant and should not be open for discussion,” particularly in the light of the Supreme Court notification dated March 3, 2014, whereby the court has urged the Centre and the states not to discriminate against HIV positive school children. Speaking to TOI, chairman of GGF Raison Almeida said that in the event the orders of the GHRC were not obeyed, the trust would move the high court to ensure that justice is done to the affected children. “This decision of the GHRC spells victory for the Goan society at large and is another step towards protecting human rights and the fundamental rights of innocent children affected by HIV in Goa,” Almeida said.

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) runs TB centre at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC) since 2007. Now, under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) it will soon use the latest equipment and testing tool called CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test). This is meant for HIV positive patients, who are extremely prone to get TB as a secondary infection due to the drastic fall in their immunity. The centre has already procured the CBNAAT equipment (commonly called as gene Xpert) under the RNTCP. It will be installed in a specially created laboratory for it in the IGGMC premises on March 24. Dr Sadaf Khateeb, medical officer of NMC’s TB centre, said that this test has emerged as a boon to HIV patients, who are usually also suffering from TB. ""Under the RNTCP programme, and as per WHO guidelines, we have been told to put all co-infected or HIV positive and suspected TB patient to this test. This can diagnose the patient for TB in general as well as the multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB within two hours. Since the instrument generates an automated report, the test can be conducted even by a laboratory technician,"" she said. Though the centre is meant for only patients living within NMC limits, all patients found to be HIV positive at the Anti-Retro-viral Therapy (ART) centre of IGGMC, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) or other NMC hospitals can be referred for TB and MDR-TB diagnosis here. “General TB patients still have to be diagnosed using the culture test, which takes about 3-5 months. But HIV positive patients suspected to be suffering from TB cannot be made to wait so much. Hence, such patients from all over the city, region and neighbouring states who come to government hospitals here can be sent to the NMC centre,” said Dr Khateeb. He said that cases of non-pulmonary (or non-lung) TB patients are on the rise in general but their percentage is higher in HIV positive patients. They are commonly diagnosed with abdominal TB, cervical lymph nodes (on the neck) etc. The HIV positive patients who are suffering from TB generally test negative in conventional smear test. But with CBNAAT, it will now be possible to easily diagnose them for TB or MDR-TB as soon as their ART treatment is started once they are referred to the NMC centre. In 2014, the centre had registered over 200 TB patients. Of these, 95% were tested for MDR and some 25-30 patients were HIV positive too. Hence, CBNAAT is set to change the diagnosis and naturally the treatment scenario of HIV positive and TB patients for the better.Help HIV+ * CBNAAT is a molecular diagnostic test to detect TB or MDR-TB in a person within two hours * CBNAAT is very sensitive and precise * Since 2007, when NMC-TB Centre was set up, it has found 239 MDR-TB cases * Of these, 54 are still under treatment at the centre * Of the 54 MDR-TB cases, 11 are HIV positive and under treatment"
19,3,2015,Nearly 60% HIV+ kids in TN face food insecurity: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Nearly-60-HIV-kids-in-TN-face-food-insecurity-Study/articleshow/46522523.cms,"CHENNAI: It's been barely a few months since Lakshmi lost her husband to AIDS. Coming to terms with the fact she and her six-year-old daughter are HIV positive, the 30-year-old daily wage worker is also faced with another challenge. Her daughter is underweight and Lakshmi is unable to provide her with nutritious meals because she has to spend most of her earnings on medicines. ""I can only afford rice, not green leafy vegetables, milk and eggs that the doctor advised for my daughter. Where will I find the money for it,"" she says. Lakshmi is not the exception. A study conducted by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) in the city found that more than half the children (59%) living with HIV hail from families that do not have reliable access to sufficient quantity of affordable and nutritious food, leading to malnutrition. This is mainly because HIV hits the productive age groups the most, causing a dip in the family income and reduced food availability for the entire household.The study shows that the effect of food insecurity in these families has left 72% of children above five and living with HIV underweight, about 69% with stunted growth and 76% wasting (low weight for height). The proportion was high especially when compared to data from the National Family Health Survey which shows the national average for underweight children and those with stunted growth below the age of five varies between 40 and 50% and between 48 and 60% respectively.READ ALSO: Four states in south make up 50% of HIV cases The 147 children aged between one and 15 years surveyed for the study conducted at the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre of a government tertiary-care hospital were either under the care of a single parent, mostly the mother as the father had died of HIV, or under foster care. ""Food insecurity in households is a problem across the country and one might ask why only children with HIV. Infections like HIV are catabolic diseases which results in diminished muscle mass and body fat. So, the daily dietary need of those with HIV is more,"" says C Padmapriyadarsini, scientist, NIRT.READ ALSO: HIV may stay hidden in 'quiet' immune cells Since malnutrition in early childhood has a spiralling effect leading to decreased cognitive, psychosocial and physical development which would affect the academic performance of the child, NIRT has recommended measures to complement the ART course. While Anti-Retroviral Therapy has been effective in controlling the disease, the study suggests interventions like targeted food assistance to the families.READ ALSO: What makes HIV vaccines backfire? Padmapriyadarsini says that a nutritional supplement would also go a long way in increasing adherence to drug management and improving nutritional status. The drugs would then act better on the individual without adverse effects and it would enhance a child's development.READ ALSO: HIV losing its edge, evolving into milder form, study finds The children involved in the NIRT study have been regularly provided with such nutritional supplements and their parents trained to provide such a diet at home at low cost. The study was done in association with Institute of Child Health and Hospital For Children and Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. NIRT now hopes that it can convince policymakers to adopt a similar strategy on a broader level. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation, there are 6,504 children living with HIV/AIDS in Tamil Nadu. Of these, 2,201 are boys and 1,849 are girls aged below 15, who are on ART as of September 2014. "

He claimed he already made four suicide attempts after pushing the burning car down a gorge. Madhya Pradesh police took custody of the accused on Tuesday. First, he tried to slash his veins and then hung himself from on a tree, but failed to kill himself. He then went to Pune and again tried to hang himself from the ceiling, but he fell down with the fan. He also planned to jump before a moving train, but could not muster courage. Considering his suicidal tendency, police in Betul have kept him under constant surveillance in the lockup and have also decided to collect his blood samples for a fresh HIV test. During interrogation he told police he was reeling under depression for four months after he came to know that he, his wife and younger daughter were HIV infected. Laboratory reports came four months ago. The incident took place on March 4 when the engineer, working with a PSU in state's Chhatarpur district, was returning from Amravati, said SHO, Multai, S K Singh. ""He is contradicting his own statements. But yes, there are cuts on his veins,"" said Singh. The accused surrendered before Amravati police in Maharashtra on Tuesday and was handed over to Multai police in Madhya Pradesh. According to his statement, the man stopped his car near Gaunighat under Betul's Multai police station, doused his car with kerosene and set it ablaze. After failed suicide attempts, he met his parents who advised him to surrender before Amravati police. Charred bodies of his 38-year-old wife and two daughters, aged 9 and 2, have been recovered. His parents said they were unaware about his HIV infection. Police booked the accused for murder and wiping out evidence."

The finding rebuts earlier scientific assumptions that Valacyclovir (Valtrex) required the presence of the other infection to benefit patients with HIV-1, researchers said. The result not only means that Valacyclovir can be used effectively with a broader range of HIV-1 patients, but also suggests promising new avenues for the development of HIV-fighting drugs.READ ALSO: IIT graduate kills family fearing HIV infection, but tests negative This insight is particularly significant given that some forms of HIV-1 have become resistant to existing medications. ""These results demonstrated that the mechanism by which Valacyclovir acts against HIV is not only through the presence of HSV-2,"" said senior author Benigno Rodriguez, associate professor of medicine and infectious diseases, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in US. Rodriguez said studies by these groups helped illuminate exactly how the medication decreases HIV-1 levels.READ ALSO:HIV losing its edge, evolving into milder form, study finds Valacyclovir is activated in virus-infected cells, and then blocks the ability of HIV to reproduce. HIV-1 can lead to the immune deficiency known as AIDS. Scientists previously thought that Valacyclovir helped reduce HIV levels and worked by decreasing the immune activation caused by HSV-2. With fewer immune cells to attack, the theory went, HIV-1 could not spread as widely. After conducting laboratory studies with Acyclovir, an earlier sibling drug of Valacyclovir, Leonid Margolis, of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), saw that the medication clearly blocked HIV-1 reproduction, even when HSV-2 was absent. Those results helped spur clinical trials of Valacyclovir in people.READ ALSO:Big boost — New drug raises hope for an HIV vaccine Beginning in June, 2009, patients from University Hospitals Case Medical Centre and from IMPACTA, the Civic Association for Health and Education in Lima, Peru, started participating in the trials, which lasted until July, 2012.

After a two-week break from any medications, the two groups switched: those previously on placebo got 12 weeks of the Valacyclovir, and those who already had taken the medication now received placebos. When study participants took Valacyclovir, their HIV viral loads went down, and when they took the placebo, their HIV viral loads went up. Ultimately, a total of 18 patients participated. ""Our most recent clinical study demonstrates that acyclovir blocks HIV replication directly.

26,3,2015,HIV/AIDS sets alarm bells ringing in Chhattisgarh,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/HIV/AIDS-sets-alarm-bells-ringing-in-Chhattisgarh/articleshow/46648558.cms," 	RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh has failed to secure maternal health, besides remaining a laggard in promoting use of contraceptives as an alternative to female sterilization, according MDG India Country Report 2015. Also, high HIV prevalence among youth, pregnant women and adults remain a cause of concern. 	In the third part of series on Millennium Development Goals (MDG) achieved by state, TOI analyses how Chhattisgarh and neighbouring MP fare on both parameters at national level. Goal 5: Improve Maternal Health 	Among major states, maternal mortality rate (MMR) (i.e. maternal deaths per one lakh live births), ranges from 61 in Kerala to 300 in Assam (highest) in 2011-13. MMR in BIMARU states of Bihar/Jharkhand (208), Madhya Pradesh/Chhattisgarh (221), Rajasthan (244), Uttar Pradesh/Uttarakhand (285) and Orissa (222) was reportedly much higher than all India level estimates (167). Four states UP, Bihar, MP/CG and Rajasthan together contributed to 67% of MMR in the country. 	Chhattisgarh and MP were also going to miss MDG target for 2015 (150.7) by a huge margin of 40 points. 	Maternal mortality rate (MM Rate), number of maternal deaths in age 15 to 49 per lakh of women was also among highest (20.2), only below UP and Rajasthan and almost double that of national average (11.7). 	Life time risk or probability that, one women of reproductive age (15 to 49) will die due to child birth within six weeks after delivery was 0.7%, higher than average. 	As per the sample registration system estimates of 2011-13, 68% of maternal deaths were women in the age group of 20 to 29 years. 	Though Madhya Pradesh along with Andhra Pradesh is expected to achieve universal coverage of births by skilled health personnel up in 2015, the proportion has actually dipped in the state from 2009 where it was 56.4% and would be 50.5% in 2015. Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria 	There have been around 2,500 deaths because of HIV/AIDS in 2011 (last available date). This was lower than MP’s 3,324 while highest was Andhra Pradesh (31,347). 	However, prevalence of HIV in youth, young pregnant women and adults was much higher than MP and more than national average in youth category while at par in the rest. Also Chhattisgarh reported double the number of new infections (4,565) than MP (2,387)in 15+ age group which is a cause for concern. This could be attributed due to the fact that condom use rate was lower in Chhattisgarh than MP (2.9 and 4.8 respectively). Both states were also lower on condom use rate among contraceptives use in India (5.2). While female sterilizations remain the preferred choice of contraceptives in both urban and rural pollution, it doesn’t protect against HIV incidence. 	MP and Chhattisgarh reported more than two lakh malaria cases in 2014 out of the 10.7 lakh total cases in the country with over a lakh cases reported from the latter state. MP reported more deaths in 2013 but fewer deaths than Chhattisgarh in 2014. More than a 1,000 deaths were reported pan India in 2013 and 2014. 	85% cases in 2014 in CG were caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which is critical as it is prone to develop severity and death.

The blood banks which are using the technique of testing the donated blood is Elisa test. A health department official said Elisa test is used to test the blood donated by a donor for blood safety. But, it has its own limitation. If a person is infected with HIV today, the test will not be able to detect HIV virus in the person for at least four weeks of being infected as it is the window period. It is a period when a person infected with HIV will test negative for HIV. But, NAT is much more improved testing which blood banks should have for ensuring blood safety. The official said that there is at least four week of window period after that Elisa test detect the HIV successfully. But in NAT, it detects successfully within the window period. He said that the various blood banks in other states have started using it but in Rajasthan, there is only one blood bank which is located in a private hospital in Jaipur, the health department official said. Just like for HIV, the Elisa test takes the same time as in case of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C of four weeks to three months. The official said that if a person is infected with HIV of hepatitis B or C today and he donated blood for transfusion into other patient, there is a risk of the person to be infected with HIV as the Elisa test cannot detect it so early. But, NAT is an advance test, which detects HIV much earlier than Elisa. "

This will be implemented through the District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), deputy commissioner AB Ibrahim, who chaired a meeting of DAPCU, said here on Monday. Noting that people living with HIV could lose out on benefits of various schemes due to lack of required documents, the DC said the model is being set up with guidance from the Karnataka State Aids Prevention Society (KSAPS) in all districts of the state. People living with HIV who are eligible can avail of social schemes can apply to DAPCU offices or DAPCU service centres, ART centres, Link ART centres and KSAPS-authorized NGOs. The DAPCU office will scrutinize applications, send them to the department concerned and ensure that the application is processed and benefits reach the applicants. Most HIV patients shy away from applying for benefits as well as legal aid because of social stigma attached to the disease, the DC said, adding that this new arrangement will help bring them into the mainstream.

29,3,2015,Woman claims she got HIV for not getting dowry,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Woman-claims-she-got-HIV-for-not-getting-dowry/articleshow/46731208.cms,"LUCKNOW: A woman in Siddharthnagar district of Uttar Pradesh, appears to have paid a heavy price for not being able to meet dowry demands allegedly made by her husband. The woman claims her husband connived with a doctor to get her infected with HIV. The FIR lodged by the woman states that her husband’s uncle, a doctor, injected her with an HIV-infected needle when she was taken by her husband for being administered a hormone injection at the clinic. The woman, in her 20s, then lodged an FIR against her husband Ramesh Srivastava, her husband’s uncle Vijay Srivastava, a practicing doctor at Itwa block of the district, and four others (All the names have been changed). The woman, Naina, a resident of Trilokpur police station area, was married to Ramesh, a resident of Velasa village in the district on April 25, 2012. Naina told the police that immediately after the marriage, Ramesh began pressuring her to ask her father for a motorcycle and Rs one lakh cash. The FIR says that as the demands were not fulfilled, Ramesh took Naina to his uncle Vijay Srivastava’s clinic, saying that she needs to be administered hormone injections as she was not able to conceive. However, when Ramesh took her for another checkup claiming that he has to get her examined for the effect of hormone injections, she came to know that she was HIV positive, station officer (SO) of Mahila Thana, Siddharthnagar, Sandhya Tiwari told TOI. Naina has lodged an FIR with the police, superintendent of police (SP), Siddharthnagar, KK Chaudhary confirmed to TOI. The SP said that since the matter is with a counselling centre as per the procedure adopted in dowry cases, action would be taken after the process is over. He also confirmed that Naina has mentioned about an HIV-infected needle being administered to her by Vijay in collusion with Ramesh. Besides Ramesh and Vijay, she has named four others as accused in the case, the SP confirmed. Ramesh had stopped living with Naina just one week after the marriage, Tiwari said, adding that action would be taken after the investigations are over."

However, children with the disease often can’t avail of them, mostly because there is no one to look after them and take them to the hospital. An organization run by an American has come to the rescue of more than 3,000 children living with HIV (CLHIV) from the city. Jerry Hughes from Minnesota, USA, has been coming to the city for the last 10 years to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS and inspire PLHIVs to be optimistic. Through the Hughes Foundation, he has also made considerable contributions to the lives of positive people in Namibia and India. Having shifted base to the city in December, after leaving a well paying job and a promising career in advertising, Jerry now plans to focus all his energies on helping HIV positive children and women of the region. “For ten years, I have been visiting Nagpur off and on to interact with PLHIVs and activists here. I felt like the place and the people were beckoning me to help and contribute in any way I could. It led to what I call ‘India 10.0’, a project in which we aim to change the face of AIDS in India. We have started with 17 orphans who are HIV positive,” said Jerry, himself an HIV positive person. For two months now, an old, beat up car is being used to cater to the health needs of these and other kids with the infection. The organization also runs a pen pal programme for women suffering from the disease, where they write emails to students at Jerry’s alma mater, the University of Minnesota. His ultimate goal is to start a centre that provides free treatment, counselling and creates awareness about the disease. The kids under the project have been provided for by a corporate group from the city while activist Samir Shinde has been looking after them for the past four years. “These are children who require special care in terms of health, nutrition, medication and developmental issues. They are also prone to becoming sick more often. Therefore, we also arrange a lot of fun activities – picnics, games, movie nights – to help their cognitive development,” he said. These activities also help in lightening the burdened souls of the kids. “HIV and people suffering from it often paint a dull, drab picture. Personally, I would like to give it a facelift, bringing in an element of hope and fun,” said Jerry. This has already begun in the form of a 1930s Hollywood-style promotional video and ‘scooter cam’, a series of social experiment videos on topics like, ‘Does mosquito bites cause HIV?’ put up on the various social media platforms of the foundation."
31,4,2015,HIV/AIDS cases register decline since 2009 in state,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/HIV/AIDS-cases-register-decline-since-2009-in-state/articleshow/46800149.cms,"PANAJI: HIV/AIDS cases have been on the decline during the last few years and a further significant drop was evident in 2014 as well. Data released by Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) indicates a drop in HIV/AIDS cases since 2009, thanks to extensive awareness about HIV/AIDS through a network of NGOs, and early detection which paved the way for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) given free at ART centres. A HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life. In 2013, 505 new cases were detected whereas in 2014 the number fell to 449. Vandana Pathankar, project director, GSACS, said that on April 1 they completed 10 years of introduction of ART therapy in Goa. While initially there was only one ART centre located in Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, which catered to over 1,000 patients, where free anti-retroviral drugs were made available, subsequently link ART plus centers were opened in the South Goa district hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and Cottage hospital, Chicalim. A large number of HIV infections occurred through the perinatal route, and annual infections through this route were between 4 to 5%. The GSACS has adopted Prevention of Parent-to-child Transmission (PPTCT) strategy which is considered cost-effective method in controlling the virus via this route. This programme basically helps effective reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection by providing quality antenatal care including preventive services. Since introduction of this programme, HIV prevalence rate among antenatal mothers who accepted HIV test has decreased from 1.48 %, in 2003 to 0.18 in 2013. GSACS’s annual bulletin has revealed that 89% of the spouses who opted for HIV test were tested positive, and HIV prevalence directly in labour has decreased from 2.46% in 2003 to 0% in 2013. Also, prominent change noted by GSACS is that the proportion of direct walk-in persons undergoing HIV testing has registered a steep increase — this is also true of female patients. Currently, GSACS also focuses on improving HIV/AIDs awareness, controlling sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including condom promotion, and ensuring availability of safe blood and blood products. Another focus area of GSACS is ART. The ART, though it does not cure HIV, it slows down the virus from multiplying so fewer viruses attack the immune system once an HIV positive person starts the treatment, says a doctor at GSACS. An HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life but subject to good adherence to the first line of ART. The GSACS now offers at GMC’s ART centre the second line of ART also which was not available in Goa earlier. HIV patients with a failure of first line of ART, were referred to J J Hospital, Mumbai. "
32,4,2015,"Malnutrition behind 55% of TB cases in India, not HIV",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Malnutrition-behind-55-of-TB-cases-in-India-not-HIV/articleshow/46801393.cms,"NEW DELHI: The search for a tuberculosis vaccine has proved elusive despite decades of research. However, there is one vaccine that has been found to cut TB disease incidence in India by half — food. Chronic lack of adequate food is the reason for more than half of the TB infections here progressing to become a fullblown disease, says a study. In an international publication 'Eradicating TB - Challenges, Perspectives, Solutions', of the Observer Research Foundation, experts from across the world and India stressed on the need for India's TB control programme to take into account the role of social conditions such as rising inequity, malnutrition, poverty and over-crowding in the spread of TB. Even though 40% of the Indian population or 480 million people carry the TB bug within their body, TB cases annually is estimated to be 2.3 million, a fraction of those who carry the infection. ""Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system. Anything that reduces the strength of one's immunity, like lack of good nutritious food, increases the risk of contracting TB,"" explained Dr Anurag Bhargava of the Himalayan Institute of Medicine and an expert on TB treatment. Instead of Direct Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS), a World Health Organisation (WHO) concept, Dr Bhargava felt that it might be more effective to have a programme more suited to Indian needs called DOST—Directly Observed and Supported Treatment – which would offer TB patients and their families nutritional support and counselling through behavorial change of healthcare providers along with treatment. He added that several studies have shown that unlike many African countries, where HIV is the biggest risk factor for TB, in India, 55% of TB is attributable to under nutrition. An annual estimated mortality of 2, 70,000 deaths means that TB claims one life in India every two minutes. According to R S Gupta, former deputy director general of the Central TB Division in India, malnutrition is one of the primary reasons for the high incidence of TB. ""TB patients suffers from loss of appetite, nutrient malabsorption, micronutrient malabsorption and altered metabolism, which leads to wasting. Deficiency in proteins and micronutrients increases the risk of TB. It has been found that malnourished TB patients have delayed recovery and higher mortality rates than well-nourished patients,"" said Gupta. ""It cannot be stressed enough that without ensuring better nutrition and environmental conditions, mere medication, no matter how good and effectively administered, is unlikely to solve the problem,"" said Harsh Sethi of the Observer Research Foundation. He added that, an underfed citizenry forced to live in unsanitary surroundings is unlikely to respond favourably to medical care. "

In his defence, Dr Manjeet Bajwa alleged that the equipment provided for surgeries at the civil hospital was of poor quality and he did want to risk getting infected. The doctor's refusal made the woman's family shift her to a private hospital in Sunet, where the baby was delivered. Taking note of the incident, Dr Inderjeet Dhingra, the project director of Prevention of Parents to Child Transmission Project which is being implemented by Punjab State AIDS Control Society, has written a complaint to higher-ups regarding the incident. The HIV-positive patient was admitted to the civil hospital's Mother Child Hospital on Monday. As soon as he came to know of the woman's condition, Dr Bajwa refused to perform the delivery. However, following pressure from Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Renu Chattwal and Punjab State Aids Control Society project director Dr US Sooch, he agreed to operate on the woman, only to go back to his earlier position on the day of the scheduled c-section. On Friday, Dr Manjeet Bajwa told the media: ""I can't put my life on stake as there are chances of getting infection from the patient. Moreover, the government provides us with low-quality kits, which are not reliable."" He also claimed that he did not get incentives for c-sections, so he could not risk his life. Dr Chattwal could not be contacted for comment on the allegations levelled by Dr Bajwa. Meanwhile, Dr Inderjeet Dhingra said, ""I have written a complaint about this discriminatory behaviour by the doctor and sent it to the addition project director of Punjab State Aids Control Society. I have sought an inquiry against him."" Dr Bajwa had reportedly performed a c-section on another HIV-positive patient on Wednesday, but that procedure was performed without any prior tests. "

35,4,2015,Soya-wheat mix can help protect immunity of HIV patients: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Soya-wheat-mix-can-help-protect-immunity-of-HIV-patients-Study/articleshow/46939815.cms,"CHENNAI: Adding a soya-wheat mix fortified with vitamins to the diet of HIV-positive people, along with regular treatment, can safeguard their immunity and general health, a new study has found. The study by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis had about 282 patients getting macronutrient supplement at Tuberculosis Research Centre clinics in Chennai and Madurai for six months. It showed not just significant improvement in nutritional parameters, but also that the CD4 cell count of these patients remained stable, indicating their immunity was being maintained. The patients who took part in the study were were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART). CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that protect the body from infection. Once infected with HIV, the cells are attacked and destroyed by the virus. However, at the time of the study, the guideline recommended initiation of ART before CD4 cell counts decrease below 250 cells while the recent guidelines suggest 350 cells. Malnutrition in HIV-positive adults is an issue that requires special attention as it leads to faster disease progression, high mortality rate and suboptimal response to anti-retroviral therapy. And if they are the bread winners, it could affect the whole family. The nutritional parameters that were observed to have significantly increased among the group that received macronutrient supplement are body weight, body mass index, mid-arm circumference, fat-free mass, and body cell mass. The observation was compared with that of a control group of 79 patients who received only standard care. This group did not show any improvement, and their CD4 count dropped. While the standard care involved treatment to prevent other diseases and treating common infections, by providing multivitamin tablets, nutritional counselling and psychosocial support. The supplement group, meanwhile, also got a mixture of whole wheat and soya bean flour fortified with vitamins and folic acid, providing a high-calorie, high-protein diet. NIRT director Dr Soumya Swaminathan said that though an increase in nutrition levels were observed, they may not be statistically significant. That was partly due to the study design and other biological and behaviourial factors. Scientist C Padmapriyadarsini says that the patients in the ‘beneficiary' group were also given interesting recipes to try out new ways to cook and eat. ""M Being a catabolic illness, HIV requires high-protein content to build muscle mass,"" she said. The study also recalled a macronutrient supplementation programme in TN for all HIV-positive patients initiating ART at government centres, which showed weight gain in treated patients. The programme was discontinued after the funding was stopped. "
36,4,2015,First HIV self-testing kit goes on sale in UK,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/First-HIV-self-testing-kit-goes-on-sale-in-UK/articleshow/47068668.cms,"LONDON: The first HIV self-testing kit that allows people to get a result in just 15 minutes at home has gone on sale in the UK. The BioSure HIV Self Test, which claims to have a 99.7 per cent accuracy rate, works in a similar way to a pregnancy test, measuring levels of antibodies in a person's blood. The test detects antibodies on a small drop of blood, taken from the finger-tip using a lancet. These antibodies are often only detectable three months after the HIV infection is caught. Two purple lines appear if the result is positive. Further blood tests are recommended if both lines appear. However, if the test is negative experts say it does not mean people are definitely virus free. The three-month window period, between the moment someone catches the infection and the time it can take for antibodies to develop, means the kit is not reliable during this time, 'BBC News' reported. It is hoped that the kit, which can be bought online, will reduce some of the 26,000 people estimated to have undiagnosed HIV in the UK. An early diagnosis allows people to get treatment quickly and can prevent serious complications. Individuals successfully treated for HIV are less likely to pass the infection on. ""We campaigned for a long time to secure the legalization of HIV self-test kits which happened in April 2014, so it is great to see the first self-test kits being approved,"" said Dr Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive at Terrence Higgins Trust. ""However, it is important to make sure people can get quick access to support when they get their result,"" Gillespie said."
37,4,2015,First HIV self-test kit on sale in UK,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/First-HIV-self-test-kit-on-sale-in-UK/articleshow/47077514.cms,"LONDON: The world’s first legally approved HIV self-test kit that reveals results in 15 minutes has gone on sale in Britain. Kits allowing people to test themselves for HIV at home were made legal in the UK last year. The move expects to help 25,000 undiagnosed HIV+ people know their status. The test is a single use, disposable device and uses a single drop of blood from a finger prick. But it may not detect HIV infections that have occurred within three months. The technology is very similar to a human pregnancy test and detects specific antibodies in your blood sample. It has a proven clinical sensitivity (if a person has HIV how often the test will be positive) of 99.7%, which means that on average 997 in every 1,000 positive results will be correct. It has a proven clinical specificity (if a person doesn’t have HIV how often will the test be negative) of 99.9%, which means that on average 999 in every 1,000 negative results will be correct. Experts advise that people who engage in activities that increase their risk of exposure to HIV, they should test regularly. One in four people living with HIV is currently unaware of their infection in England. UNAIDS recommends home testing and says people need to open up to it as fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is, therefore, a huge barrier to treatment scale up. In India, 40% of the 2.3 million people living with HIV don’t know they are infected with the deadly virus. But India is against home testing for HIV. The country’s National AIDS Control Organization has earlier said it is against allowing finger pricks or mouth swabs to be used by individuals to know their HIV status. "

The CB-NAAT equipment was introduced at the KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College (KAPVGMC) in Trichy from Tuesday. The state-of-the-art diagnosing equipment, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) became functional at the KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College (KAPVGMC) in Trichy from Tuesday to diagnose TB in HIV positive patients. It would ensure speedy results thus enabling officials to assess the health condition of the patients and begin the treatment as soon as possible. Dean M K Muralitharan of KAPVGMC inaugurated the equipment at the microbiology department of the college in a low-key affair. The microbiology department had so far relied on conventional and fluorescent microscopy to carry out sputum test to diagnose TB. However, the sensitivity of the tests through microscopy was between 60% and 70% for normal patients found with cold, cough and fever. As far as HIV patients were concerned, the sensitivity was very low. “With the setting up of CB-NAAT here, the detection of TB in HIV patients will be easier than before because the new equipment, will drastically reduce the processing time. So, the treatment can begin earlier,” said Dr S Dhanapaul, head, department of biotechnology, KAPVGMC. Almost all HIV patients will be prone to TB. So, the staff at antivirus retroviral therapy (ART) centres in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy and link ARTs across the district and neighbouring districts in the region will send the sputum to the microbiology department. A training programme for lab technicians in Trichy, Madurai and Tirunelveli was also arranged to provide hands-on experience by Dr Raja from Chennai and Dr Delphin from Coimbatore, who were deputed by the WHO. A total of 1,522 pulmonary TB patients including 1,150 men and 372 women were identified in Trichy in 2014. The district had 45 field staff to provide treatment to TB patients. "

They require nutritious food since they are on high medication, said officials of NGO Vihan, working for the HIV infected children in the district. These children are extremely poor or orphans who cannot afford nutritious food. Donors should come forward to help them, said Sanjay Saul, programme manager of Vihan. Vihan is taking care of 510 HIV infected children. Out of this, 280 cannot afford nutritious food. Following an earlier appeal, around 153 of these children were adopted by charity organizations and individuals. “There is specific requirement of calories and other necessary intake when the child is on HIV medication. Often, these children are depressed due to the stigma attached to HIV. They often fall ill as HIV attacks their immune system. In such conditions, nutritious food only can help them to survive,” Saul said. “Some of these children live with their parents, while the orphans are being taken care of by other hostel facilities. “Every month we arrange a camp at Vihan and conduct medical check ups on them. We also invite the parents so that they could be aware of the condition of their child. During this camp, we distribute the children a month’s pack of medicine and nutritious food,” Saul added. The NGO is looking for donors who could adopt responsibility of annual food packs of the children. Any individual can donate Rs 4,800 towards the cost of the annual pack to save at least one child’s life, the NGO said. Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer of the Kolhapur district AIDS control unit, is helping the NGO to find donors. Recently, the Mahalaxmi Annachhatra Seva Trust has adopted over 100 children for monthly food packs, she said. According to the unit’s estimate, 1,100 children in the district, in the 6 to 16 years age-group are living with HIV. "

Mahesh Bhatt, a 35-year-old former Army man from Gandhinagar, tested positive for HIV last year and subsequently resigned from his job. Bhatt has however decided to combat the deadly retrovirus with his positive attitude. Looking to start life anew, Bhatt first decided to beat baldness. After having a fresh new head of healthy hair following a hair transplant, Bhatt says he has not only improved his appearance but has also gained enough courage to defy any odds. After being denied a hair transplant by several hospitals, Bhatt approached Dr Ayyappan Thangavel at a multispecialty hospital in Thaltej Tekra. ""Bhatt was suffering from total hair loss up to mid scalp. Due to the virus, several ethical questions cropped up in our minds. Since the procedure involved multiple punctures, we were worried about our safety too,"" said Dr Thangavel. ""We put together a fresh set of equipment, including hand piece, drill and sharing machines, which we had to discard after the surgery,"" Dr Thangavel said. Speaking to TOI, a beaming Bhatt said: ""I'm married for two years now and generally married men don't opt for such procedures. But, it's a confidence thing at the end of the day. You feel confident with a full head of hair. Even when you are at down, I don't see why not to get it done."" On the procedure, Dr Thangavel explained: ""We injected the scalp with an anesthetic to numb the area. We used the latest follicular unit extraction method to harvest follicles. Three or four units were used behind the hairline to give a natural density and direction. Then the recipient (bald) area was prepared by creating small slits with a scalpel with a slant towards the natural hair direction and each follicle was delicately slipped into the prepared slits, giving a near-natural appearance."""

Vyom claims to have developed a method to transform the extract of this weed into silver nanoparticle which, apart from having various medical uses, holds the promise to kill different microbe’s effectively. The work is being carried forward by the scientists at the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute (IGFRI), Jhansi. Vyom, who is doing research under Prof Avinash C Pandey of Allahabad University, has converted the leaf of Congress grass into silver nanoparticle and this research in bactericidal nanomaterials has opened a new era for pharmaceutical industry. “Silver nanoparticles are the metal of choice as they hold the promise to kill microbe’s effectively as these microbes generally have a harder time developing resistance to silver than they do to antibiotics,” said Vyom. This useful finding, which has been published in Digest Journal of Nanomaterials and Biostructure, has been cited in as many as 14 researches worldwide. Explaining the finding, Prof Pandey, who is also the Vice-Chancellor of Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, said “The methodology of converting the leaf of this weed is simple wherein its extract is added to a solution of silver nitrate in laboratory and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles.” Since, the method used for synthesis of these nanoparticles does not use any added chemicals, it is cost-effective and environmental friendly and has turned the tables for this weed, considered as a menace. “These findings regarding Congress grass would make farmers build fortune as the cost of synthesising one liter of silver nanoparticle is just around Rs 30, whereas the end product can fetch Rs 3.5 lakh in the international market,” said Prof Pandey. The finding is being pursued by the scientists at IGFRI Jhansi. “The finding by Prof Pandey’s team will come handy in meeting the menace of the weed which is troubling farmers,” said director IGFRI, Prof P K Ghosh. As our country has 20% of world cattle population which has to be fed on 2% of world’s land, research such as this will go miles to meet the problem of fodder for cattle also, he added. "
43,5,2015,Footloose & fancy-free: Travails of an HIV+ child’s mother,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Footloose-fancy-free-Travails-of-an-HIV-childs-mother/articleshow/47217476.cms,"It’s Mother’s Day today. And what does a poor, sick mother, desperately trying to ensure that her HIV positive orphaned child gets his essential daily dose of life-saving medicines get? Insensitivity, buck-passing and indolence by the government medical fraternity and the BSACS officials! On Thursday, incidentally observed as AIDS Orphans Day (part of the annual global Aids awareness week), a desperate 25-year-old widow in Chhapra was running from pillar to post in a frantic bid to obtain the next dose of ART for her eight-year-old son. An HIV positive person needs to take the prescribed medicine daily, just like a daily insulin dose for diabetics. If the dose is missed, even for a day, the immune system of the patient starts deteriorating. The people at the ART dispensing centre were helpless, stocks were over (The special ART formulation for children is given in a syrup form). When the woman, in desperation, went to submit a written intimation to the nodal medical officer, pleading that the medicine be made available, she was brushed aside. He refused to accept her application. The woman, a widow, who somehow ekes out a living working in a private school, is distraught. For the past five days, she has abandoned her work, running to and fro the dispensing centre. The irony is that the medication can only be obtained from the government centre and no private chemist shop in Chhapra stocks the medicine, which is very expensive. “I went to get the medicines on the May 4, a day before the last dose ran out (This is the practice. Patients are given medicines for a month only, and they can’t ask for any advance stock). There was no medicine available. My child is on ART since 2011. What’s worrying me is that in January, when a CD-4 count was done, his platelet count had dropped to 311 from 1100. I’m desperate,” she said over the phone. Exactly 14 days ago, I happened to visit the Chhapra ART centre with RTI activist Sanjeet Singh, where the persons concerned told us that stocks were low. “We are just not receiving adequate stocks from BSACS, and we struggle to do what we can,” they said. “The high court has decreed that every ART centre should have a two-month stock of ART medicines and medicines for opportunistic infections, but despite assurances from BSACS officials, see the situation!” says Sanjeet. In Chhapra, the situation is overwhelming. Last month 1748 patients received ART. There are about 150 children on ART. NACO guidelines are not met. BSACS has not appointed the required staff. No medical officer, so obviously, no ‘accountable’ official! Pregnant women have to buy their own ‘safe delivery kits’ from private stores in Patna because the hospital has no stock. HIV positive pregnant women are denied surgery at Chhapra. The official line is, “So far, no such case has been brought to our notice.” There is no CD4 testing machine, even though NACO funds were there for one unit in each district, it is said. The woman says, “My child is the only reason I am living, if he dies, I am nothing, I might as well destroy myself.” Just as I write the finishing line to this article, Saturday 8am, I receive a phone call. The ART medicines have finally arrived, and will be given out today. Happy Mother’s Day!"

The baby, born in prison on January 22, was handed over to the Salem-based Lifeline Trust adoption agency on May 11 after his mother expressed her unwillingness to bring up yet another child in prison. “We have completed all procedures following the her willingness to surrender her baby. The baby will be in Lifeline Trust until he is put up for adoption. Meanwhile, if the mother changes her mind, she can seek to get back her child within 60 days,” district social welfare officer (DSWO) S Usha told TOI. Convicted in the year 2002 by a Trichy court for killing her two female children, born out of her first marriage, the 37-year-old woman hailing from Thathaingarpettai village in the district, was lodged in the special prison on March 31, 2004. In January, 2009 the Madurai Bench of the Madras high court granted her bail and admitted her appeal against the lower court’s conviction and life term. The woman had been arrested for jumping into a well with her two daughters in 2002. The two children drowned while she was rescued. Police said she resorted to the extreme step following a fight with her first husband Selvaraj, who passed away a few years ago. After the high court upheld the lower court’s conviction of life term, the woman was lodged in prison in March 2014. Meanwhile, she had married again. “When she returned to prison, she was pregnant and also had a baby boy with her. We learnt she got married again. It was sad that both she and her third child were diagnosed with HIV,” said prison superintendent K Jayabharathi. Her third child, a one-and-a-half-year-old boy, is living with her in the prison. The counsellors from the district AIDS prevention and control unit (DAPCU) took care of the woman and her two children. All of them were administered anti-retroviral therapy (ART). An official in DAPCU said, “Early infant diagnosis was done for the baby. Blood sample was taken and sent for tests a few days before he was surrendered. We are sure the baby is not HIV positive as the woman was being given ART treatment when she was pregnant.” "

The inquiry marked by civil surgeon Dr Renu Chattwal has been completed by district family welfare officer Dr Maninder Singh and report said that Manjeet is guilty as he refused treatment to HIV+ patient due to fear of getting infected and referred the case to other hospital. The file has already been sent to principal secretary for action. The HIV+ patient had refused for C-section and was admitted in mother child hospital, Ludhiana on March 30. As soon as Manjeet came to know about the patient being HIV positive he denied performing the delivery. But after much of pressure put up by civil surgeon, senior medical officer and Dr. US Sooch, project coordinator, (Punjab State aids control society), he agreed for it. But he once again refused to carry out the delivery on April 1. This discriminatory behavior of doctor compelled the family to take the patient to Baba hospital. The complaint was submitted by NGO working for the HIV high-risk group patients in city thereafter."

The parents have alleged BJP’s pressure on probe because according to them, BJP’s local MLA Mahendra Mashroo runs the Sarvodaya blood bank, which used to supply blood for the thallasemic kids, though the blood bank was not registered at all. They have claimed that CBI has failed to pin up the responsibility and on the contrary defended the blood bank thought it was not registered. They have also highlighted form CBI report on negligent the blood bank management was that they kept tested, untested blood units in same refridgerator. CBI is supposed to reply on June 16. The parents filed their protest petition last year against CBI’s clean chit to Mashroo and hospital authorities. The CBI has also stated that infection through infected needle could not be ruled out, but it is difficult to find out at this stage. Thirty-four kids have been infected with HIV following blood transfusion in Junagadh civil hospital. Nine of them have passed away. "
47,5,2015,Scientists find new strategy to starve HIV to death,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Scientists-find-new-strategy-to-starve-HIV-to-death/articleshow/47471875.cms,"LONDON: Scientists have found a new strategy to starve the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to death - by blocking its sugar and nutrient pipeline. HIV has a voracious sweet tooth, which turns out to be its Achilles' heel, according to researchers from Northwestern Medicine and Vanderbilt University. After the virus invades an activated immune cell, it craves sugar and nutrients from the cell to replicate and fuel its wild growth throughout the body. READ ALSO: HIV losing its edge, evolving into milder form, study finds Scientists discovered the switch that turns on the immune cell's abundant sugar and nutrient pipeline. Then they blocked the switch with an experimental compound, shutting down the pipeline and, thereby, starving HIV to death. The virus was unable to replicate in human cells in vitro. The discovery may have applications in treating cancer, which also has an immense appetite for sugar and other nutrients in the cell, which it needs to grow and spread. ""This compound can be the precursor for something that can be used in the future as part of a cocktail to treat HIV that improves on the effective medicines we have today,"" said Harry Taylor, assistant professor in Medicine-Infectious Diseases. READ ALSO: First HIV self-test kit on sale in UK HIV needs to grow in a type of immune cell (CD4+ T-cell) that is active, meaning it is already responding to pathogens in the blood. Activation increases the T-cell's supplies of sugar and other critical nutrients needed for both cell and virus growth. Until now, no one knew the first step that signalled a newly activated T-cell to stock up on sugar and other nutrients. Those nutrients become the building blocks of genetic material the cell and the virus need to grow. Northwestern and Vanderbilt scientists figured out that the first step in stocking the T-cell's pantry involved turning on a cell component called phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Then they used an experimental compound to block PLD1 and shut down the pipeline. This is believed to be the first time scientists have targeted the virus's ability to pilfer the cell's pantry to stop its growth. READ ALSO: Antibody therapy manages to reduce 300-fold HIV’s viral load The compound also slowed the proliferation of the abnormally activated immune cells, the study found. Current HIV medications stop HIV growth but do not affect the abnormal excess activation and growth of immune cells triggered by HIV. The excess immune cell growth is believed to contribute to the life-long persistence of HIV and leads to excess inflammation that causes premature organ damage in HIV patients - even when the virus is suppressed by current medicines. ""Perhaps this new approach, which slows the growth of the immune cells, could reduce the dangerous inflammation and thwart the life-long persistence of HIV,"" Taylor added. The study was published in the journal PLOS Pathogens.READ ALSO: New vaccine can improve HIV treatment"

Blood donors and doctors in the city say that most of the blood banks do not comply with testing norms while collecting blood. “Whenever blood is collected, the banks must conduct a test ­ called the Elisa test to check for HIV-AIDS virus. But, most banks do not do so,“ said Ghanshyam Ojha, a member of Team India, a leading NGO working in the field. Ojha explained that the Elisa test results become clear only after 36 hours. But, due to scarcity of blood and high demand, the blood is used even before its test results are obtained. As per records with the State Aids Control Society (SACS), there are 2 lakh people who have tested positive for HIV in Telangana. Despite this startling figure, lack of enforcement of rules in blood banks is raising alarm among doctors. In fact, the society does not even have a record of those banks which do not comply with safety norms. “Every blood bank must be checked to see if they are following the proper protocol. It is during times of crisis, usually dur ing epidemics such as dengue, that blood units are pushed out before they are checked,“ said a senior SACS official, adding that it is a crime to send out blood without testing it. ""The government has made drug enforcement teams responsible for the checks. But in a city as large as Hyderabad, these teams are grossly understaffed,"" the official added. Dr Ram Mohan, joint director, blood safety, SACS added: “Usually, testing kits are provided at nominal rates. But there are many blood banks which do not follow testing protocol. It is the state blood transfusion council's prerogative to ensure that bad blood does not reach the public.“Times View The government should immediately intervene and ensure that all blood units are properly checked before transfusion. There have been too many cases of contracting HIV through blood transfusion across the country. There should be more staff and the latest equipment available to speed up testing in blood banks. "

The incident came to light on Tuesday when the girl and her mother walked into the Makkala Sahaya Vani office at the city police headquarters seeking justice. The mother told counsellors that her daughter had been cheated by the man, a driver. She had learnt later that the man was already married. Realizing that they had a case of child marriage, rape, polygamy and cheating on their hands, the counsellors asked for more details. On getting information from the mother, the counsellors recalled that they had received a similar complaint from a pregnant woman at Vanita Sahayavani two years ago. They looked into their files and realized that the man had been married thrice before and they'd received a complaint from another woman who said he had married her sister. The woman, who said her husband was HIV-positive, was pregnant and also infected. ""The woman had complained that her husband had eloped with her younger sister and made her pregnant. As the young woman was HIV-positive, we advised her to have an abortion. A year later, he got into a relationship with the young woman's cousin and she contracted the infection. The man was later taken into custody but the wife withdrew her complaint after a couple of days,"" a counsellor at the helpline said. ""Today's case is one of rape of a minor and teenage pregnancy. She has just weeks to go for her due date, and hence counselling her was essential,"" said a counsellor. ""We do not know if she is HIV positive. The man is not undergoing any treatment."" The girl was sent to the child welfare committee. The counsellors summoned the man and his first wife before the child welfare committee. The man has been sent to the Wilson Garden police station.

Six-year-old Sunaina (name changed), daughter of a HIV positive couple, lost her parents a month back. Earlier, the child and her parents were living in a makeshift tent under National Highway flyover in Surathkal in the city. Tragedy struck Sunaina when she lost her HIV positive mother a month ago. Later, it was another sequential shocker for her when she lost her father too. Fortunately for her, Thabassum, founder, Sneha Deep, gave Sunaina a helping hand by offering her food, clothing and shelter, and most of all, education. When Thabassum came to know about Sunaina's plight through locals , she brought Sunaina to Sneha Deep and now the girl has been admitted to class 1 in a local school. Sneha Deep, which was started by Thabassum in 2010 in the city, has 15 children of HIV parents. Thabassum takes care of children with the same love and care that any other mothers deliver. Sunaina, whose test reports show negative for HIV is happy to be with Sneha Deep. A social worker, Thabassum runs the centre with the support of donors and fights literally to manage daily and monthly expenses. Braving all odds in the city, especially the negative reactions from the community and society, Thabassum continues to care for children in her centre. Narrating the story of Sunaina, Thabassum told TOI that the girl will be given good care and education. ""I was born and brought up in a poor family. I fought all odds to complete my education. The death of a friend, who was suffering from HIV, touched my heart and that made me dedicate my life to children of HIV positive parents. It requires at least Rs 55,000 per month to run the centre. I am now taking care of children. I do not consider caste, religion or any other aspects before accepting a responsibility for a child,"" said Thabassum, who strives to bring smiles to deprived children.

55,6,2015,This vaccine could help block HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/This-vaccine-could-help-block-HIV/articleshow/47742533.cms,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have designed a new experimental HIV vaccine that may stimulate the immune system to block infection from the deadly virus. New research led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the Rockefeller University shows in mice that the vaccine candidate can stimulate the immune system activity necessary to stop HIV infection. The findings could provide key information for the development of an effective AIDS vaccine, researchers said. The research, published in the journals Cell and Science, represents a leap forward in the effort to develop a vaccine against HIV, which has so far struggled to elicit antibodies (immune system molecules) that can effectively fight off different strains of the virus. “The results are pretty spectacular,” said Dennis Burton, chairman of the TSRI department of immunology and microbial science. While many vaccines for other diseases use a dead or inactive version of the disease-causing microbe itself to trigger antibody production, immunisations with “native” HIV proteins are ineffective in triggering an effective immune response, due to HIV’s ability to evade detection from the immune system and mutate rapidly into new strains. This challenge has led researchers to believe that a successful AIDS vaccine will need a series of related, but slightly different proteins (immunogens) to train the body to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV- a twist on the traditional “booster” shot, where a person is exposed to the same immunogen multiple times. The scientists tested one of these potential proteins, an immunogen called eOD-GT8 60mer, using a technique called B cell sorting. The researchers showed that immunisation with eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody “precursors” — with some of the traits necessary to recognize and block HIV infection. This suggested that eOD-GT8 60mer could be a good candidate to serve as the first in a series of immunisations against HIV, researchers said. “The vaccine appears to work well in our mouse model to ‘prime’ the antibody response,” said TSRI professor David Nemazee.

56,6,2015,"Punjab, Chandigarh see jump in fresh HIV cases",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Punjab-Chandigarh-see-jump-in-fresh-HIV-cases/articleshow/47778185.cms,"CHANDIGARH: Punjab's battle against drug abuse just got tougher. The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has sounded an alert on the unexpected spurt in fresh HIV infections in Punjab and Chandigarh. Experts are calling this 'worrisome' because both regions were seen as low prevalence places compared to other parts of the country. NACO officials believe the jump may be because of an increase in the number of injecting drug users (IDUs), however, there is no data available on such drug users. These numbers have come to light when the Union home minister Rajnath Singh, on his visit to Anandpur Sahib last week, had asked the youth in Punjab to shun drugs. His statement upset the ruling Akali Dal which has said that Punjab is being defamed for fighting the drug menace. NACO's observations have been seconded by another report of the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare submitted to the Rajya Sabha in April. It names Assam, Delhi, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab and Uttarakhand as states which have shown a rise in adult HIV prevalence. It also points at reduced funding to NACO which may have shrunk its role in these regions. Dr B B Rewari, national programme officer (antiretroviral therapy), NACO, said, ""The rise is in the last five years. Punjab has more IDUs than the north-eastern states and that is main risk factor for HIV infections."" In fact, Chandigarh, which is often seen as insulated from Punjab's drug problem because of its Union Territory status, has started showing some of the symptoms. A study, 'High risk behaviours of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Chandigarh' says that 48.9% of IDUs shared needles. The study was conducted by A Das Mohapatra, Manmeet Kaur, Rajesh Kumar and P V M Lakshmi of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. The prevalence of needle sharing has been reported by various national studies to be 30.3% and 41.9% among IDUs in Haryana and Punjab. ""Chandigarh is not far from Punjab which has a high number of IDUs. So, we are not surprised by the results,"" says Kumar. "

Over 182 projects that cater to nearly three lakh high-risk population in the state will suffer as distribution of condoms and syringes to availability of medicines and testing kits will take a direct hit. The circular issued on June 11 has asked NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) to curtail the strength of their peer educators by 80% and outreach workers by 25%. A majority of these agencies have not received a dime from the state body since January this year, and therefore have been grappling with massive attrition due to non-payment of salaries. The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricants and syringes in the state’s most vulnerable pockets. Peer educators are members or leaders who belong to the high-risk community (female sex workers, transgenders and men having sex with men) and carry out the crucial task of distributing condoms and motivating people to get tested. The MSACS in its circular blamed the change in funding pattern of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for the delay in receiving funds, which are likely to arrive only by October this year. However, TOI has learned that NACO had released around Rs 8 crore as a contingency measure, which has been lying with the state treasury for the past two months. Project director Khushalsinh Pardeshi could not be reached for comment. MSACS that presented an annual budget of Rs 130.12 crore had received only three-fourths of the money. The annual plan for 2015-2016 of nearly Rs 200 crore is yet to be approved by NACO, which has committed only 80% or less. Maharashtra till date remains one of the six high-risk states in the country with a prevalence rate of 0.40%. According to NACO’s annual report, over 40,000 people had tested positive for HIV in 2013-2014 out of the 20 lakh who were tested, indicating that the HIV scare is still very pertinent. The fund crunch, said to be one of the worst for the state body, has already started affecting people living with HIV. The stock of anti-retroviral medicines that keep nearly 1.80lakh adults and 11,000 children alive is erratic. While NACO provides the ART drugs, MSACS would often financially support NGOS to locally purchase drugs if the drugs did not come on time. “CBOs like us are struggling for existence. Who do you think will worry about some patients not getting medicines on time or progressing to the second line?” asked a Pune-based agency that is thinking of giving up three of its projects. The crisis has also reached the state body’s doorstep. Sources told TOI that the last lot of condoms has already been distributed to NGOs, while consumables required to draw blood and carry out HIV tests are long over at MSACS. Worse, the state body has run out of paper to print HIV test reports at several of its Integrated Centres for Counselling and Testing (ICTC). “It is appalling how a national programme used the services of female sex workers and transgenders and now wants to get rid of them. Many of them have left prostitution to work fully for the programme. What are we going to tell them?” questioned Meena Seeshu, who runs three projects at Sangli. As per the state diktat, 40 of her peer educators stand to lose employment. “We suspect the rate of new infections is already going up,” said a Pune-based NGO’s director. Following the circular, at least two NGOs have communicated to MSACS that they will be withdrawing their projects with female sex workers and migrants. When TOI contacted NACO, a senior official from the finance department said that it is time the state bore some burden of the HIV programme. “We have formed a committee that will negotiate with state governments. We will still be paying most of the money,” the official said. The country’s HIV programme has taken a beating since multilateral organizations, including WHO and several UN agencies such as UNICEF and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have drastically reduced or diverted funds since 2013.

Thirty-year-old Meena’s (name changed) story might give an indication. Admitted to Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College in the city on June 19 for a caesarean delivery, doctors not only pasted a big piece of paper on her bed that screamed ‘Bio Hazard +ve’, complete with the red AIDS ribbon drawn on it to announce that here was one battling the deadly virus, she was also made to clean her own medical waste after the stitches were cut three days later. Not stopping at that, a senior doctor also allegedly abused Meena for “bringing another diseased child into the world”. Because of the handwritten pamphlet, all her relatives and friends who visited her at the hospital have now come to know of her HIV positive status, adding to the woman's extreme anxiety.READ ALSO: No funds, no condoms, 3L in Maharashtra at HIV risk When news about the ill-treatment of Meena reached the Care Support Centre (CSC) that fights for the rights of people living with HIV (PLHIVs), members of its district responsible team (DRT), Ritu Saxena and Vinita Devi, went to the hospital where they found the piece of paper still stuck to her bedside. “We immediately tore it off and took the authorities to task. Fearing that the issue might become too big to handle, the hospital staff rushed to control the damage,” Saxena told TOI on Thursday. Hospital authorities confirmed the “unfortunate” incident and said they have apologized to the patient. “I understand this should not have happened but the doctors have given a written apology and the patient has made peace with the staff,” said Abhilasha Gupta, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department at the hospital.READ ALSO: IIT graduate kills family fearing HIV infection, but tests negative Talking to TOI from her bed, Meena said that she had contracted the disease from her husband eight years ago and had kept it a closely guarded secret. “Due to the negligence of the doctors, it has now become public knowledge,” she said. “Not only did I have to face abuse about my condition, even my girl child was not spared. They termed her a ‘dreaded disease’,” she wept. CSC coordinator Badri Singh has now filed a written complaint with the nodal officer at Anti Retro Viral Therapy Centre, LLRM. “The pasting of the paper sheet at the bedside was wrong. It is the medical staff’s duty to respect the secrecy of a patient’s medical condition. I will certainly look into the other allegations as well,” said chief medical superintendent of the hospital Subhash Singh. "

61,7,2015,Scientists find potential new HIV therapy,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Scientists-find-potential-new-HIV-therapy/articleshow/47906282.cms,"NEW YORK: Scientists have discovered a way to block replication of the most common form of HIV at a key moment when the infection is just starting to develop. Transmitted through bodily fluids, the HIV-1 virus infects and destroys key immune cells, known as CD4 T cells, that would ordinarily mount a defense against the virus and initiate the antiviral activity of other immune cells. Scientists have long known that a substance produced by CD4 T cells called Interleukin-21 (IL-21) plays an important role in the immune system by activating immune cells that specialise in killing viruses like HIV-1 and driving the production of antibodies that attack them. However, it was unclear how IL-21 might affect the early stages of HIV-1 infection that allows the virus to grow and spread unabated soon after a person is exposed. Researchers from Weill Cornell Medical College, the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University conducted two studies to uncover this effect. The researchers created a culture from human tissues, primarily spleen and lymph node tissue. After exposing the cells to IL-21, they introduced HIV-1 and found that after 72 hours, cultures with IL-21 contained more than two-thirds less virus than those that didn't receive the treatment. The second model tested IL-21 in mice transplanted with human stem cells to create a physiological environment as close as possible to that in people. Over the course of two weeks, the mice began producing IL-21. After 14 days, more than half of the mice with IL-21 did not display a detectable level of HIV-1. An analysis of the results suggested that IL-21 not only jump starts the immune system but also stops the HIV-1 virus from replicating during a critical, early window of its development, when it is concentrated in one location and has not yet started to spread throughout the body. ""This study highlights components of the human immune system that are capable of mounting an antiviral response and driving intrinsic resistance to HIV-1,"" said senior author Dr Laurie H Glimcher, of Weill Cornell Medical College. ""We are hopeful that this knowledge will help bring us one step closer to shielding patients from this deadly and complex virus,"" Glimcher said. The reduction in viral load is due to the cascade of events initiated by IL-21. The investigators found that IL-21 instructs CD4 T cells to increase the amount of a small RNA molecule. That molecule, microRNA-29 (miR-29), inhibits the replication of HIV-1, limiting the amount of virus produced from infected cells. ""Our study has uncovered a potentially potent arsenal that patients have against the virus. We think IL-21 is one of those arsenals and that deploying it early will be very powerful in fighting the infection,"" said lead author Dr Stanley Adoro, a postdoctoral associate in medicine in Glimcher's lab. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. "

The woman (identity withheld), who delivered the child on July 2, was shocked to find the notice put up by her bedside and the cradle for the baby in a ward (No. 4), which had 24 other women. The humiliation of the couple did not end with the just the notice, as the staff kept addressing the women as “HIV walli” instead of her name. Recounting what he termed as “humiliating days”, the husband said while the staff in the ward addressed all the women with their first names, my wife was called “HIV walli”. He said his requests to the staff to refrain from doing so made no difference and they were made to feel “outcastes” in the ward. Though at present there are no comprehensive laws in India to deal with the menace of discrimination with HIV/AIDS infected people and their rights, India is signatory to various international treaties and agreements that provide for protection and non-discrimination with those suffering from the disease. In fact two legislations, the HIV/AIDS Bill 2007 and Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014, which provide for non-discrimination with those suffering from the disease, are pending clearance in the Parliament. Dubbing the act of the BR Ambedkar hospital staff as “illegal”, experts point out that a HIV positive person has the right to keep his/her HIV/AIDS status confidential. They say that even Courts have upheld that that in case HIV patients do not want to disclose their identity, they can use a pseudonym before even the Courts to suppress their identity. A leading lawyer pointed out that the Bombay High court had ruled that the court would permit HIV positive litigant to suppress his or her identity and prosecute or defend the proceedings under an assumed name. “When the law is clear, then why isn’t it followed in the hospital”, questioned Rinki Arora, president of Chhattisgarh Network of positive. Admitting that it could be in the interest of the staff to know that an individual is an HIV patient, Rinki said the status of the individual could be mentioned on their health sheets and the prescriptions rather than publically declaring her status by putting put a poster and addressing her as “HIV walli”. Rinki said moreover, the infant has yet not be tested for the disease as the same could be conducted only after two months and the subsequent process for confirming the actual status of HIV could take up to 18 months. “The hospital staff has already branded the child HIV positive by the poster on the side of the cradle”, she said. Advocacy officer of Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotion trust, Amruta Alpesh Soni, who also visited the hospital, said the staff cannot disclose the identity of an HIV patient and it had violated the NACO guidelines by doing so. When contacted, hospital’s public relation officer, Shubhra, said the staff put up the “universal precaution” notice to make duty nurses aware of the patient’s status. She however, admitted that it was wrong to address the patient by her HIV status and the administration would look into it. "

Three weeks ago, the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) issued a circular asking NGOs to retrench workforce and curtail awareness activities due to paucity of funds. 	Public health minister Deepak Sawant said the state is aware of the hardship that the programme is going through but any fund commitment at this point looked difficult. “We have already sent a file to the Union health ministry urging them to continue funding the programme,” he said. 	Since its inception over two decades ago, MSACS has always received 100% funding from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). Trouble started brewing at NACO since 2013, when several international agencies started diverting funds from HIV to other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. The NACO, now completely dependent on the central government funds, has been facing financial constraint itself. The crisis became more pronounced with the Centre slashing health budget by 17% last year. 	Sawant explained that NACO may be looking at 75:25 funding model, which currently exists for other national programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission. “NACO is expecting us to bear 25% of the programme cost. We have told the Centre that the state is already grappling with fund crunch. So, they should grant funds till we can allocate something from the state kitty,” Sawant added. MSACS has a budget of nearly Rs 150 crore that is used to sustain 142 of the 182 targeted intervention projects in the state. “The state programme caters to over eight lakh people, including female sex workers,” said an NGO from Pune that has not received any funds since January. 	According to the MSACS circular, NGOs have to do away with 80% of the sanctioned strength of peer educators and 25% of outreach workers. On onwe hand, project director of MSACS Khushalsinh Pardeshi has assured that the core prevention activities will not suffer, but on the other hand, he admitted that NACO is behind its schedule of approving the 2015-16 plan for HIV prevention. “NACO has asked state governments to contribute at least 50% of the cost,” he said. 	Stuck in this confusion are community-based organizations, such as Malwani-based Sakhi Char Chowghi Trust that works towards prevention of HIV among transgender and fear closure now as they are completely dependent on MSACS’s funds. MSACS, meanwhile, is desperately hoping that the state will expedite and release an amount of Rs 11.89 crore sanctioned by NACO, but waiting for cabinet approval. Till then, over 3000 people, many of who are HIV positive, fear loss of livelihood from July. "

Midwives or 'dayis' will be soon allowed to do HIV testing. The health ministry is set to issue a notification allowing midwives trained by the government to conduct HIV testing on pregnant women to diagnose the infection at an early stage, a source said. The idea is to make testing more accessible in order to prevent parent to child transmission of HIV or AIDS virus. ""Prevention of parent to child transmission of HIV virus is an essential part of AIDS control programme. While such testing is often available and conducted in a good hospital setting, it is not the same in rural areas and distant villages. Most of the time HIV screening does not happen even at public health centres (PHCs),"" says Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager at Aids Healthcare Foundation India. According to the source, mid-wives will be trained by state and district AIDS control organizations to conduct rapid tests to check HIV virus. Rapid tests are cold blood tests done through finger pricking. Mid-wives will be allowed to do the tests anytime during the pregnancy prior to delivery. The health ministry is likely to issue the notification by end of this month allowing midwives to do such tests. ""At a later stage, the government may even consider allowing ayurvedacharyas or AYUSH doctors to carry on these tests,"" the source said. Experts say early screening or diagnosis in pregnant women is crucial because if one tests positive than through procedures and interventions the spread of the virus to the unborn child can be prevented. ""There is an urgent need for India to upgrade to community based testing to increase accessibility and out reach,"" Mohanty said. Estimates by National Aids Control Organization (NACO), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus. Currently, India has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world, according to estimates of United Nations."

According to the report titled ""How AIDS changed everything - MDG 6: 15 years, 15 lesson of hope from the AIDS response"", the world has exceeded the targets contained in the Millennium Development Goals (MGD) to halt and reverse the spread of HIV. New HIV infections have fallen by 35 per cent and AIDS-related deaths by 41 per cent, while the global response to HIV has averted 30 million new infections and nearly 8 million AIDS-related deaths since 2000, when the MDGs were set said the report that was released in Addis Ababa yesterday by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). ""The measure of success for the United Nations is not what we promise, but what we deliver for those who need us most. When it comes to halting and beginning to reverse the AIDS epidemic, the world has delivered,"" UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said following the report's launch. Ban said 15 million people on HIV treatment meant that the world was on its way to an AIDS-free generation. It also means that nearly 75 per cent of all pregnant women living with HIV have access to antiretroviral medicines that improve the quality of their lives and protect their children from HIV, he said. The report noted that India ""literally"" changed the course of its national HIV epidemic through the use of strategic information that guided its focus to the locations and population approach. ""This placed communities at the centre of the response through the engagement of non-state actors and centrally managed policy and donor coordination,"" it said. HIV treatment coverage for people living with HIV and TB has also increased and in terms of numbers of patients, the largest increases in antiretroviral therapy among people living with both HIV and TB have occurred in India, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia. India accounts for more than 60 per cent of the Asia Pacific region's people living with HIV-associated TB. The report noted that currently nearly 85 per cent of the antiretroviral medicines for HIV treatment come from India. It said the Indian government had also succeeded in preserving the legislative and policy spaces that permit Indian companies that make generic medicines to consolidate their exporting capacities to other developing countries. Currently, however, India is under pressure from several companies and governments of developed countries to dilute these provisions in free-trade agreements being negotiated with them, it said. "

Holding the hospital and the medical practitioners responsible for “medical negligence”, the forum also directed them to pay Rs 25,000 for the costs incurred by the lawyer while fighting the case. The hospital and the two doctors have, however, denied any wrongdoing and said they would appeal against the verdict. 	The lawyer, Subhash Mohanrao Pachlore, of Harsul in Aurangabad, was admitted to the hospital by his wife and relatives on July 11, 2007. He had a history of headaches, giddiness and loss of consciousness. A physician at the hospital, M A Majid, sent Pachlore’s blood sample to a pathology laboratory for the HIV test. 	Pachlore told the forum that when he was being discharged from hospital three days later, the physician told his wife in the presence of relatives about the laboratory report indicating the HIV-positive status. He said the hospital discharge card also mentioned the HIV positivity. 	Pachlore took the HIV test again at another pathology laboratory on July 14 but the findings were negative. In 2009, he filed a complaint with district forum against the hospital and the medical practitioners at the hospital and the first laboratory. 	The forum headed by K N Tungar and comprising of members Sandhya Barlinge and Kiran R Thole observed, “The respondents were negligent in rendering their service to the complainant. They have acted negligently by disclosing a false positive report to the complainant, his wife and their relatives. They are guilty of causing mental and psychological agony to the wife of the complainant. 	The complainant and his wife must have experienced huge affliction during such a long period and lost their peace of mind.” 	Physician Majid told TOI that Pachlore had been hospitalised for cortical venous sinus thrombosis. He claimed that after the first HIV test was reactive, it was repeated the same day. “The second finding was negative. Pachlore’s wife was counselled and informed as he was drowsy and irritable. He was discharged after three days,” he said. 	Majid said Pachlore had faith in the hospital as he got re-admitted for fever three days later. “He has suppressed this fact. Due to poor legal representation, the district forum imposed a fine on us in 2010. We appealed in the state forum and the fine was reduced to Rs 5 lakh. We challenged it in the national forum, which quashed both the orders and sent the matter back to the district forum saying that no proper opportunity was given to the respondents and that no medical expert evidence was taken by the lower courts,” he said. 	Majid said they had got their deposit with interest on the order of the national forum. “The complainant went to Supreme Court for a stay on the judgment of the national forum, which was dismissed in 2011. However, the district forum did not consider the medical expert evidence and has passed this judgment against us. There was no negligence on our part. We are shocked by this judgment and will appeal in the state forum again,” he added. "
73,7,2015,NACO guidelines help state see drop in birth of HIV positive babies,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/NACO-guidelines-help-state-see-drop-in-birth-of-HIV-positive-babies/articleshow/48209054.cms,"PANAJI: Since 2014, 22 babies born to HIV positive mothers at Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, have tested negative. This is in contrast to previous years when the hospital used to get three to four cases of babies born infected with the deadly disease, yearly. This, doctors say, proves the results of prevention of parent to child transmission are finally showing. Prevention of parent to child transmission was introduced in Goa after a significant number of new HIV cases were found to be occurring through the perinatal route— transmission of an illness from mother to child. A change was seen after new guidelines were rolled out by the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) in January 2014. Dr Wanda Viegas, senior medical officer at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre at GMC, said that a significant change was seen after they started implementing the new guidelines. Now, a pregnant woman who’s HIV positive is immediately put on ART as opposed to the earlier method of starting treatment in the delivery room after pregnancy. Then, the mother was given a single dose of Nevirapine tablet and the baby a single dose of syrup. ART is a combination of drugs given to HIV-infected persons with CD4 count less than 350. The CD4 count is an indicator of one’s immune system, and a falling CD4 count means a person infected with HIV is exposed to opportunistic infections. Normally, ART treatment for HIV patients is started only after his/her clinical investigation is conducted but Viegas said that in the case of pregnant mothers, they do not wait until the investigation is completed. “The HIV carrier who’s pregnant is immediately put on ART while an investigation is conducted subsequently,” she added. Since April, three pregnant women have been put on the medication. Currently, 280 children are registered with the ART centre, of which 184 children are undergoing ART. “Some of the children going through ART have now attained 18-20 years of age and are doing well,” she said. Doctors say that it is sad as some HIV positive children who have lost one or both parents, are entirely dependant on other members of the family who in most cases, do not care enough. A doctor says, “We have a case of a boy who lost both his parents to AIDS. His visits to the ART center are irregular as his uncle does not give him money to travel.” Some children, mostly above 10 years of age, come to the centre alone to collect their monthly dose of medicines in the absence of a family member to escort them. An HIV positive person taking ART can lead a healthy life provided he/she sticks to a healthy lifestyle and adheres completely to the therapy. "

Noori was told she had tested positive for HIV, a then little known virus that was viciously attacking people around her. “She said I didn’t have much time to live as they had only recently discovered the disease and there was no cure. I was asked to make my life count,” said Noori, a transgender who gave up commercial sex work to help people from her community. The woman who delivered the report to Noori was Dr Suniti Solomon, whose pioneering work in HIV a year earlier had startled the medical fraternity and pushed the government to act. In 1986, Dr Solomon, then a microbiologist at Madras Medical College, and her team for the first time documented evidence of HIV infection in India. Noori was among the second batch of around 135 commercial sex workers from Chennai who were tested. “She didn’t just break down science for us. She taught us to live,” said Noori. For close to three decades Dr Solomon used science to save and make lives, and lost hers to cancer. She passed away at her residence in Chennai on Tuesday morning. She was 76, and is survived by her son Dr Sunil Solomon. “We lost a prolific scientist, a great teacher and a wonderful person who worked tirelessly to bring science to the people,” said Dr Sundar Sundararaman, her student and later her colleague. Born into the illustrious Gaitonde family, Dr Solomon graduated from Madras Medical College. She married eminent cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr Solomon Victor. While Dr Solomon Victor focused on treating poor patients and in 1989 conceived the Rheumatic Heart Ailment project, Dr Suniti Solomon moved beyond research to set up Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE), a premier HIV/AIDS care and support centre, in Chennai. “More than the virus itself, Dr Solomon was concerned about the stigma HIV positive people faced,” said Dr D Dhanikachalam, head of technical support unit, Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). “When the epidemic was first discovered, people were afraid to go close to those with HIV. She felt the pain they went through and worked to fight not just the virus but the discrimination too,” he said. Trained in pathology in the UK and the US, her experience covered a range of aspects linked to HIV infection, biomedical parameters to socio-economics. She also published papers extensively on HIV epidemiology, prevention, care, support and related gender issues. In 2012, Dr Suniti Solomon was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for Service on HIV/AIDS by the state-run Dr MGR Medical University here. In 2009, the ministry of science and technology conferred the ‘National Women Bio-scientist Award’ on her. In 2001, she was given a similar award for her pioneering work on HIV/AIDS by the state run-medical varsity. A fellow of National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS), New Delhi, she had served on several boards, including National Technical Team on Women and AIDS, Advisory Board of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative-India, the Scientific Committee of the National AIDS Research Institute Pune and the Microbicide Committee of Indian Council of Medical Research. “She was a no nonsense person with a high sense of commitment. Her work is testified through hundreds of publications and her contribution is acknowledged across the world. As a teacher, she taught over 25 batches of students in MMC,” Dr Sundararaman. In an earlier interaction with TOI, Dr Solomon had commended the work Tamil Nadu had done in the field of HIV/AIDS and said the state had come a long way in screening, but the programmes had become complacent with counselling. “We have contained the infection to an extent among truckers and female sex workers. But if we become complacent there will be an increase of incidence among these as well,” she had said. People who worked with her are not surprised by her prediction. “She worked tirelessly for the cause not just inside labs but outside as well. If she was concerned, there were obvious reasons,” said a microbiologist, who worked closely with her in the late 90’s. Dr Solomon also said it was unfortunate that despite 30 years of the HIV epidemic and the progress made, there is still no cure or effective vaccine for the infection. “But what is killing people with AIDS more is the stigma and discrimination,” she had said.

Ravi (name changed) alleged that his 15-year-old son who is a thalassemia patient was infected with HIV after a blood transfusion at Kashiba Hospital. The teenager is a thalassemia patient since birth and requires regular blood transfusions. Ravi alleged that his son was tested positive for HIV after he underwent blood tests at another laboratory. ""The complainant said that his son was born at Kashiba Hospital and was diagnosed with thalassemia soon after. He was being treated there and required monthly blood transfusions,"" said Karelibaug police inspector J D Waghela. He added, ""The boy became unwell earlier in January this year and was taken to a clinic in Panigate. He was complaining of severe stomach ache and was not responding to medications. The doctor advised blood tests and it was found that he was HIV positive."" Authorities of Kashiba Hospital claimed that the infection could not have spread from their facility. ""The hospital has a blood bank of its own and we do not source blood from other banks unless there is an emergency. The hospital duly tests every donor's blood sample before it is stored,"" said superintendent of the hospital Dr Jayant Doshi. ""We have not received any other case of such infection. The police had approached us and we are cooperating with them in every possible way,"" said managing trustee of Kashiba Hospital, Dr Jagdish Patel. Ravi who used to drive a rented auto-rickshaw in the old city area had later taken up a job at Kashiba Hospital. He worked on a contract basis and was relieved of his duties in April this year. ""He was a sanitation worker here and was responsible for cleaning the wards along with the laboratory vessels. The hospital did not employ him directly and is unaware of the reasons leading to his termination,"" said senior administrator of the hospital Panna Desai. The police is yet to file a complaint. ""We are investigating the case and have asked the hospital to submit the boy's complete medical history along with details of the blood transfusions he underwent in the past one year. We will decide further course after preliminary investigation,"" Waghela said. "
78,8,2015,HIV app to help spread awareness,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/HIV-app-to-help-spread-awareness/articleshow/48548664.cms,"PANAJI: Union minister of state for Ayush Shripad Naik on Wednesday announced the launch of a mobile app that will provide complete information on HIV, raise awareness and provide locations of the nearest HIV/AIDS counselling and testing centres. Naik launched the mobile app in Goa at a function to celebrate International Youth Day at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium, Taleigao, in the presence of chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza, sports and youth affairs minister Ramesh Tawadkar and others. Dubbed ‘Help’ — HIV education and link to prevention— the app ensures confidentiality and can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play. It is expected to reach over 11crore people across rural and urban India. Naik said that the government has an aggressive intervention programme to combat HIV/AIDS. The unique feature of the anti-HIV programme is that it has always kept the marginalized and high-risk groups as the focus areas. Over 15,000 integrated counselling and testing centres are now functional across the country. Over 410 anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres provide treatment to about 7.4 lakh HIV patients in India. Naik said that since Goa is a popular tourist destination, it needs a robust strategy. This is an important occasion to reiterate that our prevention service reaches every person. Parsekar said that of the 120 crore people in India, 50% are below the age of 25 and that is why, it is imperative to focus on issues affecting the youth and to understand the challenges they face. Though HIV has declined in Goa in recent years, the government wants to take it to zero level and also do away with the stigma attached to it. Another highlight of the function is the testimonies given by two teenagers from Bengaluru. Babu Seenappa, 14, and Manik Prabhu, 16, both represented India in the international children’s games in Netherlands in June this year. Both are HIV positive and reside at Sneha Care Home, Bengaluru. Seenappa was born with HIV but now competes in 5km and 10km races. Prabhu runs 100m and relays. Speaking about his participation in an international competition, Babu said it was a proud moment for him. “HIV did not stop me and will never stop me from doing anything. Many of my friends have been denied admissions to schools because of their HIV status but we cannot spread infection through normal contact. Let us build a better world free from stigma and discrimination,” he said. "

A classic example is that of Keshava (name changed). The 42-year-old has been an HIV positive since 2004 and initially he was in a bad condition. Doctors too had given up on him. But today, Keshava is leading a dignified life. He could walk over 3km a day without any support. ""I did not think I could live. It's only because of self-confidence and moral support that I could survive,"" says Keshava. Initially, he did not take treatment due to financial constraints. He owned a petty shop to sustain his family. In 2011, his health deteriorated and he was bedridden, unable to even move his hands. Doctors sent him back home losing all hope, he added. His mother Sathyavathi says she owes it all to the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM). ""If my son is alive, it's only because of SVYM and its volunteers' moral support,"" she says. Despite his failing health, he did small jobs like starting a mobile recharge shop to support his family. Thanks to the palliative care facility of SVYM, the bedridden patients and their families get support. The facility, apart from taking care of patients, also helps their family members to avail governmental benefits. ""Now, I am receiving widow pension and my son is getting pension from the government. Palliative care volunteers helped me get these benefits,"" said Sathyavathi. The CD4 count in HIV patients should be above 350 but if the count falls below that, patients may become bedridden and the risks are very high, says district AIDS controller Dr T Raghu Kumar. Keshava had CD4 count below 50 when palliative care volunteers visited him in 2012. Like him, more than 300 bedridden needy patients have availed palliative care. Today, some of them are leading a dignified life. ""The goal is to improve the quality of life for patients and their families. The need of palliative care is essential in terminal and chronic diseases as they are incurable and result in physical, psychological, socio-economic strain to individuals and their families,"" says palliative care volunteer Dr Deepak Murthy. The palliative care facility has served 345 bedridden patients suffering from cancer, paralysis, spinal cord injury, severe neurological disorders, hypertension, gangrene, kidney failure, cerebral palsy and other illnesses since 2011. Initially, 88 patients were inducted into the programme. Palliative care operates with a team approach consisting of doctors, nurses, counsellors, social workers and volunteers visiting each patient's home and providing a holistic care for patients to improve the quality of life by using an array of skills at their doorstep.

However, the ban on HIV-positive foreigners who are looking to work in Singapore or accompanying a child studying here and intend to stay for a long period is still in place. The ban on short-term HIV-positive visitors was lifted on April 1, but it stays on long-term visitors, The Straits Times reported on Monday. ""The policy on the repatriation and permanent blacklisting of HIV-positive foreigners was recommended in the late 1980s when the disease was new, fatal and no effective treatment was available,"" a ministry of health spokesman was quoted as saying by the daily. The short-term ban was lifted ""given the current context with more than 5,000 Singapore residents living with HIV and the availability of effective treatment for the diseases."" ""Lifting the short-term travel restrictions... poses very low additional risk of HIV transmission to the local population,"" the spokesman said. However, the public health risk posed by long-stayers is not insignificant, hence the restriction on long-term visits has been retained. The Singapore rule is similar to immigration laws in other countries like Australia and New Zealand, he added. Foreigners in Singapore, excluding permanent residents and spouses of Singaporeans, found to be HIV-positive will be deported and put on a permanent blacklist. A spokesman for advocacy group 'Action for Aids' has welcomed the change, but said the restrictions should also be lifted for long-term visitors. ""People living with HIV or Aids are not criminals and should not be banned from entering the country. ""(They) can and should be able to have fulfilling and rewarding lives, with loving relationships and be integrated as part of the community. Unfortunately, discrimination is still prevalent,"" the daily quoted the spokesman as saying. "
81,9,2015,"HIV-positive, and now happily married",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/HIV-positive-and-now-happily-married/articleshow/48840813.cms," PUNE: Arranging 500 marriages in seven years may not sound like a great achievement for a matrimonial website. But for PositiveSaathi.com it is no mean feat. Seven years ago, when city-based Regional Transport Office inspector Anil Valiv launched this matrimonial website dedicated to matchmaking of HIV-positive people, he never thought his initiative would get such a huge response. ""We do not have the resources to follow up on our registered users, but we conservatively estimate that at least 500 marriages have been fixed among our users. The number can even be double of that,"" Valiv said. Valiv was posted in Latur in 2006 when he heard about an HIV positive man looking for a bride and thought of starting a website that connects HIV positive people. Operating out of a small office in Mangalwar Peth, PositiveSaathi.com has emerged as a relative success story. It registers bride and groom-seekers for free, regularly organises matrimonial meets and has quite a few success stories to its credit. One such matrimonial meet was held in Mumbai on Saturday in association with the State AIDS Control Society. ""We have had to convince potential users that we verify the users' background regularly, and that their identities shall be secured to all possible extents,"" Valiv said. Among the first marriages the website forged was that of an HIV-positive boy from Hyderabad, who was working in Singapore, with a London-based Indian girl who had divorced her husband after she found she had contracted the infection from him. She also had a daughter. Both had registered themselves on the website and after meeting and talking to each other, they decided to tie the knot. Administrators of the website say that the matrimonial process is fairly arduous and one that requires them to stay alert. There are many fake profiles and profiles of married people too, which is why they have to frequently revisit their databases and carry out background checks of users. ""Another problem is the male-to-female registration ratio on our website as well as in our matrimonial meets is heavily skewed. For every 10 male registrations, only about two to three women register. Also, after the potential bride and groom meet through the website or via the meetings, aspects like financial condition, caste, creed, and religion do come up,"" he said. The success stories more than make up for the hassles. ""In 2012, we had organised a similar matrimonial meet for HIV-positive persons in Pune, and to our surprise, five couples who met that day went to a registrar and got married,"" one of the website administrators said. Then there was the case of a 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Pune who was encouraged by her uncles to get married again after her divorce. She came to know about our website from her doctor. Her profile was soon uploaded on the website where she connected with a man from Mumbai. They got married two years ago. The website's administrators say the website can possibly achieve much more if there is state support. ""We do not really receive much support from the state government. In fact, we collaborated with the state AIDS control society for the first time during our Mumbai meet. To get people to register on our website, we try to engage various non-governmental organisations, who have been working in the field of HIV-AIDS prevention. Their participation is very crucial for our venture to work,"" said Valiv."

This came to light during a media sensitization workshop in Shimla wherein HIV positive people shared life experiences. The workshop was organized by Mamta Health Institute for Mother and Child, New Delhi, in collaboration with Himachal Pradesh State AIDS Control Society and Himachal Pradesh Voluntary Health Association. Shreshtha (name changed), a woman from Kangra district, was thrown out of her house by her in-laws on coming to know about her HIV status. This despite the fact that she was infected by her husband, a truck driver and was forced to live in misery along with her two children. However, she was lucky to get help of village panchayats and a local NGO. Today, she is heading an organization that works in association with panchayati raj institutions to create awareness about HIV positive people. In 2011, she was also awarded the best social worker award. Bhago (name changed), another HIV positive woman from Kangra district, was passed on the infection by her husband. However, the damage catapult as by the time she came to know about her being HIV positive, she had three children from the marriage. She earns her livelihood by working as daily wager and fear of being stigmatized by the society is not letting her reveal her status. Women alone are not the ones to suffer. Sohan Lal (name changed) from Bilaspur was detected with HIV in 1990, but till date he has not revealed his being HIV positive to his relatives and villagers as he fears to he will be ostracized once he reveals the truth. ""I could reveal this to my family members only after five years,"" he added. Himachal Pradesh health director Dr D S Gurung said that 30 NGOs are working for HIV positive people in the state. He said drug abuse is increasing in border areas of the state and that is leading increasing cases of HIV too. He said that recently a meeting was held in which a proposal to provide pension to HIV positive people and bus passes for free travel for treatment was discussed too. A health official said that female sex workers are being provided vocation training and 550 have already been included under livelihood training. Vocation training to them would be provided at Industrial Training Institutes of Nahan, kala Amb, Solan, Bilaspur, Mandi, Shimla, Nalagrh and Baddi. Himachal's challenge Though Himachal Pradesh falls under the category of low prevalent state where the infection rate among the adult HIV prevalence is 0.17% with total count of positive persons at 8,091, efforts are on to nail down the causes that are resulting in spread of HIV/AIDS. As unprotected sex contributes 88% in the spread of HIV/AIDS, efforts are being made to rehabilitate female sex workers operating in the state. Official sources informed that around 10,000 female sex workers are operating in Himachal Pradesh, of which around 6,900 are working with the NGOs for their rehabilitation. "

However, Soni questioned the logic of keeping the dead body in open for nearly 17 hours in this sultry heat despite the fact that all freezers were unoccupied. She said the room where the body was kept was not even air-conditioned. She even alleged that there were ants on the body when they picked it up this morning. 	Accusing the government of doing little for HIV+ orphaned children, Soni said there about 400 such children in the state and there is no rehabilitation policy for them, making their lives miserable. “These orphans have been left to fend for themselves and they suffer discrimination everyday”, she said. 	Soni said People Living with HIV (PLHIV) had given a proposal to Women and Child Welfare department four months back for setting up a home for such children but nothing has been done so far. When contacted, Secretary of Women and Child Welfare department, Dinesh Srivastava said they have received the proposal and it has been sent to central ministry for approval for setting up two homes for HIV Orphans in cities of Raipur and Bilaspur. “We are hopeful to get an approval at the department’s annual meeting, scheduled next month,” said Srivastava. 	As per annual report of National AIDS Control Organisation (2014-15), number of people living with HIV alive and on ART as on September 2014 in Chhattisgarh are 6368 and of these 3569 are male and 2343 are female. The number of male children is 255 and female is 194. "
85,9,2015,New antibody may fight HIV better,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/New-antibody-may-fight-HIV-better/articleshow/48950841.cms,"LOS ANGELES: Scientists have identified a novel antibody that could more effectively detect and neutralise HIV virus in an infected patient. Proteins called broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) are a promising key to the prevention of infection by HIV , the virus that causes AIDS. The bNAbs have been found in blood samples from some HIV patients whose immune systems can naturally control the infection. These antibodies may protect a patient's healthy cells by recognising a protein called the envelope spike, present on the surface of all HIV strains and inhibiting, or neutralising, the effects of the virus. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered that one particular bNAb may be able to recognise this signature protein, even as it takes on different conformations during infection -making it easier to detect and neutralise the viruses in an infected patient. The study was published in the journal Cell. "
86,9,2015,Natural defence against HIV discovered,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Natural-defence-against-HIV-discovered/articleshow/48997785.cms,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have discovered a new natural defence against HIV infection in the form of a protein that prevents the deadly virus from replicating. ""In earlier studies, we knew that we could interfere with the spread of HIV-1, but we couldn't identify the mechanism that was stopping the process,"" said Yong-Hui Zheng, Michigan State University (MSU) associate professor and co-author of the study. ""We now know that ERManI is an essential key, and that it has the potential as a antiretroviral treatment,"" said Zheng. Antiretroviral treatments are not vaccines; they simply keep HIV in check in low levels in the body. While it could be decades before an ERManI-based treatment can be prescribed for HIV-1 patients, these results provide a strong path for future research involving human cells, and later, clinical tests. The next steps will be to test if HIV resistance can be promoted by increasing ERManI levels, said Zheng, who worked on the study with scientists from the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the University of Georgia. Most viruses have viral envelopes, or protective skins, that comprise similar building blocks of the host the pathogens are trying to infect. On the surface of the envelope, there are viral glycoproteins, known as Env spikes, which act as valets, leading viruses to binding sites that allow infections to spread at the molecular level. They serve as a key of sorts that gives viruses entry into the host to begin spreading. Zheng's lab was the first to show that HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein biosynthesis can be specifically inhibited by ERManI, which is a host enzyme to add sugars to proteins. By identifying ERManI as the target that slows the spread of HIV-1, the team showed a target in which future natural therapies can be developed. More than 1.2 million people in the US have HIV. In China, doctors diagnosed 104,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS in 2014. The number of infections is rising, though overall the country still has a low rate of infection. Currently, there is no cure for HIV-1; once patients have it, they have it for life. While there are antiretroviral therapies available, they can only prolong life, albeit dramatically, but they cannot cure the disease. Current drug treatments have to be taken for a lifetime, which causes side effects and many other issues, Zheng said. ""We see a way to treat this disease by helping the body protect itself,"" he said. The study was published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. "
87,9,2015,Lack of funding forcing HIV-AIDS projects to shut down,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Lack-of-funding-forcing-HIV-AIDS-projects-to-shut-down/articleshow/49005033.cms," Nagpur: Last month representatives from some NGOs working towards elimination of HIV-AIDS among vulnerable groups met officials from Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) about non-payment of funds since January this year. They had been assured and promised that at least a part of the huge sum due would be forwarded by the first week of September. However, the transfer of the official they had spoken to has led the activists to believe there would be further delay in payment. 	The then MSACS project director Khushalsingh Pardesi has now been transferred to Amravati as the district collector. Having managed the targeted intervention (TI) projects for months now, most NGOs are finding it difficult to continue. They are now considering going on a strike. “Most organizations and workers have been using personal funds for the projects, which also they have run out of now. This is affecting the projects since the staff does only what they can personally afford, not having any salary since eight months. Even their landlords and kirana shop owners are not ready to give them any more loans,” said Anand Chandrani from Sarathi Trust that works for the LGBT community. He worried that some of his staffers being transgenders would not even get jobs elsewhere. 	Similar concerns are worrying other project managers as well. “Outreach workers who have to travel to villages frequently have warned they will no longer be doing so. In several other NGOs, staffers have already left,” informed Varsha Pagale who oversees TI programmes for migrant workers, truckers and female sex workers (FSW) at Indian Institute of Youth Welfare (IIYW). She said that most staffers were dejected as they were expecting being able to spend the festival season well with the money promised by September. 	Sources within MSACS said funds had come from National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) but files were moving from table to table to get signatures from various sanctioning authorities. IA Kundan, state mission director of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) under which NACO now operates, has called for a meeting later this week and officials are optimistic about the funds being released soon. 	Dr MS Diggikar, joint director, care, support and treatment (CST) department of MSACS, claimed the process of release of funds was almost complete and may be expected in a week’s time. Activists though are not ready to believe in assurances any more. They say they have been hearing similar things for months. Hemlata Pande from Red Cross Society who manages the TI project for FSWs is writing to union minister Nitin Gadkari, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule about this. “Other states are also facing the same problem. Government staffers like those working in ART and ICTC centres are getting paid, but not those working at grassroots level who are actually taking the patients to the centres by working in difficult situations, exposing themselves to the infection as well,” she said. 	THE PROMISE 		NGOs running projects for HIV-AIDS prevention among vulnerable groups have not received funds since January 		Project directors of the affected projects met MSACS officials last month 		They were assured that ‘some part’ of the funds would be disbursed by early September by which time MSACS project director Kushalsingh Pardesi was shifted 	COST OF THE PROJECTS - 		155 NGOs are working on targeted intervention projects, each having 30 staffers on average across the state 		Depending on TI group and project, the government owes each NGO anywhere between Rs8 lakh to Rs20 lakh 		The total pending sum towards the projects amounts to Rs11 crore. 	IN THE ABSENCE OF PROJECTS 		Awareness about HIV-AIDS will suffer 		No counselling or testing of vulnerable groups 		Number of infections, that have now been stabilized, will increase 	NATIONAL AIDS CONTROL ORGANISATION (NACO) 		International funds started drying up in 2013, making NACO dependent on funds from central government 		In June 2014, NACO was merged with National Rural Health Mission as the central government felt the HIV prevalence rate was down 		Merger led to red tapism and delay as funds began to be routed to state societies through state finance departments "

The app, first of its kind in India, is based on various international models. The app would provide all kinds of information on AIDS, which is not easily available otherwise. For instance, it will provide information of HIV testing centres in the locality, information on availability of free testing kits and medicines etc. The app, called HELP (HIV Education and Linkage to Prevention), will also prompt users to access HIV testing from the nearest centre free of cost. The idea is to bridge the awareness and accessibility gap through digital intervention and encourage youth to know their HIV status. The move will also help the government to keep a count on the incidence and prevalence of HIV cases, which is currently a major area of contention. The national AIDS control programme is the government's largest health intervention programme. The programme, run under NACO and implemented by states, demonstrated an overall reduction of 57 per cent in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to NACO's 2013-14 annual report. However, the facts were questioned by many international agencies, which said a lot of people in India are unaware of their HIV status. According to the United Nations, India has the third highest number of estimated people living with HIV in the world. ""To start with, it will provide some basic information but slowly we will ramp it up to include detailed information and education as well as various services,"" an official said. AIDS Healthcare Foundation, an international agency which works in the area, is working with the government to expand the use of the app across the country. AHF has also funded the app, while NACO is taking care of the operations and implementation part. According to the official, the app will ensure confidentiality and can currently be operated in two languages - English and Hindi. The health ministry is expecting to reach more than 11 crore people across urban and rural geographies through the app. The government is also planning to launch promotional advertisements for the app on television and radio. Besides, it will also use social media and you tube to popularize it. ""Once the app is popular among the youth, we will update it to include more information,"" the official said adding in future it can also be used to spread awareness about many other diseases and preventive healthcare measures. ""There is a gap between the estimated number of people living with HIV and those who have tested and know their status. It is critical that people know their HIV status early so that they can opt for treatment,"" he said. "

Even as the state records more and more cases of HIV/AIDS, the ambitious condom-vending machine project has well and truly flopped. A fact sheet of the Assam State Aids Control Society (ASACS), highlighting district-wise detection of HIV cases till December 31, 2014, reported 3,820 HIV positive cases from Kamrup (Metro) district alone. This was the highest in Assam. Owing to its status as the gateway to the northeast, Kamrup (Metro) district, with Guwahati as its centre, urgently requires revival of the condom-vending machines and more condom-distribution outlets, say experts dealing with the prevention of HIV/AIDS. Assam is particularly vulnerable as it is surrounded by high-prevalence states like Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. Initiated almost a decade ago to ensure greater HIV/AIDS prevention by ASACS, the machines were installed in various parts of the city with a high presence of sex workers. “The condom-vending machine project is not part of our programme anymore. We don’t know how or why it was excluded. The project was unsuccessful. Instead, now we have people who distribute free condoms at hospitals and centres,” said Chiranjeev Bhattacharjya, state epidemiologist, ASACS. The ASACS report said though Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland have shown a decline in annual new HIV infections, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh are reporting new infections every year. An expert of AIDS Prevention Society, an NGO, said the project to install condom-vending machines in different parts of the city was a one-time initiative that met a quick death because the machines were not monitored constantly and a scientific study was not undertaken before the project was initiated. “Condom-vending machines are usually installed in places like public toilets. Here, there was no monitoring or regular stocking. A detailed study should have been taken to see how many people actually use the machines. As far as I know, no such study was conducted,” said SI Ahmed, AIDS/HIV expert and chairman of the NGO. Assam recorded its first case of AIDS in 1990. Till 31 December, 2014, the state recorded a total of 9,991 HIV positive cases. Of this, 6,082 patients were men, 3,445 were women, 455 were children and nine, transgender."

They refused to attend the monthly review meeting last Saturday. Staffers of ART centres and ICTC centres have also not got their salaries for last month and are joining this campaign. These NGOs have not been getting any funds to run their projects since January this year. The money, coming from the union government, is supposed to be directed through the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). Project managers from these organizations had been promised that at least part of the funds will be disbursed by September. While this has not happened, even salaries of the staff working under the MSACS have not been paid for September. “The meeting on Saturday was a regular review meet in which NGOs are expected to share data and experiences about their monthly activities. This data form the basis for the plans to be made by the government with regards to the awareness activities and the ways to arrest the spread of HIV,” informed programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) Tanuja Fale. She admitted that all eight NGOs from the district kept away from the meeting. Similar meetings took place in all the districts of the state last week. Only 10-15 of the 156 NGOs attended them, most choosing to boycott it. As the salaries of staffers of Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres, Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) and DAPCU did not come for the month of September, they have stopped sending monthly reports they send to MSACS. These reports consist of information about the number of medicines taken by the HIV positive people in the district, stock of the medicines available at the centre and people walking in for getting tested for STIS, among other data. “We have tried several democratic ways of getting the attention of the authorities to our problems. We have only been hearing that the money will come ‘in the next few days’ for the last eight months. We have also written letters to union minister Nitin Gadkari, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and state health department, none of whom have given anything other than assurances,” said Hemlata Lohave, project manager of the targeted intervention programme at Red Cross Society. She added that the government would be responsible if the HIV infection rose because of their inattention. This is bound to happen as not only are the awareness programmes for vulnerable population under threat but the People Living with HIV (PLHIV) are also not being catered to properly, said other activists."

In Maharashtra, the rates have fallen from 9% to 0.6% between 2001 and 2015,” informed Pravin Hiware from Noble Shikshan Sanstha of Chandrapur that works among female sex workers (FSW), migrant workers and truckers. He added that FSWs who were free of the infection 15 years ago are still free of it because the organization’s efforts to make them more aware and distribute condoms among them. 	Amit Nagrare from Gaurav Trust of the city said that inconsistent supply of medicines and condoms also affected the rapport that the project managers and counsellors share with the target population. “After this, when the counsellors want to take the people for getting tested for sexually transmitted infections, they refuse. All this makes them more vulnerable,” he said. 	“Those who already have HIV also don’t get medicines in time. This can be fatal as their viral load can rise even if one dose of medicines is given late,” said project manager of Red Cross Society Hemlata Lohave. 	Anand Chandrani from Sarathi Trust said that either the government must assure us that the funds would be released in time or clearly tell us that the projects do not need to be run anymore.

Avadesh, along with his brother, uploaded a prospective bride’s fake profile an attractive photograph, stating that she was HIV positive and was looking for a groom who is also affected with the same disease. An Urdu teacher from Secunderabad responded to the match and called the number given in the contact details. It was Avadesh who answered the call and fixed a meeting. When the victim approached them, Suman was introduced as Shivani Sharma as mentioned in the fake profile. Both Shivani and the victim spoke to each other and decided to marry. After a few days, Shivani told the victim that she has only Rs 2 lakh as savings and it would be insufficient for them to settle in Delhi and wanted to know how much money he could pool in. The victim said that he would raise the money by selling his house in Secunderabad and accordingly, he sold it for Rs 16 lakh. The money was then transferred to the accused’ bank account for taking a house on rent in Delhi. After collecting Rs 16 lakh, the accused kept the phone switched off and remained inaccessible.

The development opens up new avenues for understanding why the HIV virus persists in some patients, and remains dormant and undetectable in others. While existing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) stops the HIV virus from replicating, it does not completely remove the virus. Destroying the hidden reservoirs of the virus remains one of the holy grails of HIV research. Led by Oxford researcher professor John Frater, the international research team analysed data from a randomised study of patients with primary HIV infection. They compared the T-cells of 154 patients in Europe, Brazil and Australia who had their ART treatment interrupted after 12 or 48 weeks. T-cells play a central role in protecting the immune system. After coming up with a shortlist of 18 immune system biomarkers, researchers discovered that three of them -- PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 -- were statistically significant predictors of when the virus would rebound. The researchers found that high levels of these biomarkers, attached to 'exhausted' T-cells prior to patients commencing ART, were associated with earlier rebound of the virus following treatment interruption. ""Focusing on the exhaustion markers was an important step as it has given us vital clues as to why some people are able to better control the virus after therapy has been interrupted,"" said Professor Rodney Phillips from UNSW. Study co-author Professor Anthony Kelleher from UNSW said understanding the mechanisms that allow HIV to remain in 'remission' is essential if the virus is to be eradicated. ""We want to be able to predict how the virus will behave before we take patients off ART to test drug therapies aimed at eradicating HIV,"" he said. The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications. "

98,10,2015,New low-cost printer tracks HIV patients' health,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/New-low-cost-printer-tracks-HIV-patients-health/articleshow/49439214.cms,"WASHINGTON: US researchers have patented a low-cost printer that helps HIV patients living in low-resource settings track the health of their cells. Patients with HIV are encouraged to participate in regular checkups to keep track of their health. In high resource settings, devices known as flow cytometers complete the tests by analysing the blood. Flow cytometers, however, are bulky machines that run on electricity. The machines also cost upwards of USD 50,000. ""Flow cytometers are not practical for areas with limited resources like Africa or Mexico,"" said Thomas Boland, a professor of metallurgical, materials and biomedical engineering at University of Texas at El Paso who created a less expensive, battery-powered health monitoring tool for use in third world countries. The portable device works by helping clinicians count the number of CD4 cells - cells that are attacked by HIV - in the body. After drawing a patient's blood, clinicians mix in magnetic microscale beads that latch on to CD4 cells in the blood. The mixture is then placed in an inkjet printer that's been modified to print out cells instead of ink. Rather than printing vertically onto a sheet of paper, the cells are shot out horizontally onto a magnetised microscopic slide. CD4 cells in the blood automatically attach to the slide, while other cells that do not need to be counted dribble down into an excess container. Doctors can then look at the slide through a microscope to count the number of CD4 cells on it. That number is inserted into an equation that calculates the total number of CD4 cells in the individual's body. The procedure takes as little as 20 minutes, resulting in ultra-quick results. Boland hopes his new printer will help doctors and patients in low-resource settings who don't have access to flow cytometers. The next step in the process is to license the technology to a company that is willing to help get it on the market. Several doctors in Mexico have already expressed interest in the device, Boland said. "
99,10,2015,New low-cost printer to track HIV patients’ health,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/New-low-cost-printer-to-track-HIV-patients-health/articleshow/49440696.cms,"US researchers have patented a low-cost printer that helps HIV patients living in low-resource settings track the health of their cells. Patients with HIV are encouraged to participate in regular check-ups to keep a track of their health. In high resource settings, devices known as flow cytometers complete the tests by analysing the blood. These, however, are bulky machines that run on electricity. With its cost being upwards of USD 50,000, regions with limited resources can hardly afford them. As a solution to this, Thomas Boland, a Professor of metallurgical, materials and biomedical engineering at University of Texas has created a less expensive, battery-powered health monitoring tool for use in third world countries. The portable device works by helping clinicians count the number of CD4 cells — cells that are attacked by HIV — in the body. After drawing a patient’s blood, clinicians mix in magnetic microscale beads that latch on to CD4 cells in the blood. The mixture is then placed in an inkjet printer that’s been modified to print out cells instead of ink. Rather than printing vertically onto a sheet of paper, the cells are shot out horizontally onto a magnetised microscopic slide. CD4 cells in the blood automatically attach to the slide, while other cells that do not need to be counted dribble down into an excess container. Doctors can then look at the slide through a microscope to count the number of CD4 cells on it.

The 31-year-old culprit is a resident of Mirjalguda in Malkajgiri. According to police, the auto driver had married thrice and all his wives deserted him due to his wayward habits. Merwya Carl, a software engineer from Seven Hills Colony in Uppal, lodged a complaint with the Uppal police on October 17 alleging that burglars stole five-tola gold jewellery from his house. On August 5, 2015, Carl and his wife left the city on some personal work and they realized about the burglary after returning home on October 17. While leaving the house, Carl gave keys of his house to a group of friends with whom he parties at home when the family members were away. The auto driver is also part of the group. Police summoned all the friends of Carl for questioning. During interrogation, the auto driver confessed to have committed the offence. Police recovered the stolen booty of five-tola gold from his possession. When police grilled him about the other crimes committed by him, he informed them about gambling cases booked against him at the Lalaguda and Malkajgiri police stations. ""He also confessed that he has been suffering from HIV disease, which he came to know about several months ago. The auto driver also claimed he visits prostitutes daily and has illicit affairs with several other women, with whom he practiced unsafe sex even after realizing about his disease,"" Uppal inspector (Detective) Khaja Moinuddin said. The culprit told police that after realizing about his disease, he had unprotected sex with over 300 women, including some housewives, whom he came in contact while taking their children to school in his auto. The culprit was remanded in judicial custody. The Uppal police also caught a 22-year-old thief, G Mahesh, during vehicle check at Ramanthapur on Tuesday while he was travelling on a stolen bike. Based on his confession, police recovered 11 stolen bikes from his possession. The culprit committed the offences in the past year at Uppal and Nacharam areas. "
101,10,2015,Germany’s Boehringer denied patent on HIV drug,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Germanys-Boehringer-denied-patent-on-HIV-drug/articleshow/49475528.cms,"MUMBAI: The Indian Patent Office has denied Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim a patent on its key HIV drug, Nevirapine, for a version sold as Viramune XR (extended release), yet again thwarting attempts by Big Pharma for “exclusivity” extension on their patented drugs to reportedly block entry of affordable generics. The application on the Nevirapine extended release formulation was refused since it was found to be “obvious” and lacking inventive step, violating Section 3 (d) of the Indian Patent Act — a provision under which Novartis lost the patent on its blockbuster drug Glivec in 2013. Simply put, Viramune XR was found to be merely a new form of something already known, without demonstration of any enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Section 3(d) — an important safeguard in the patent law specifically relevant for pharma and chemical industries — prohibits grant of patents to new forms of known substances, unless the new form results in enhanced efficacy over the known substance. The MNC had applied for a patent in India on the extended release of the HIV drug in July 2009, on which domestic company Cipla filed a pre-grant opposition in 2011, and later launched its generic version. The application was examined by the Indian Patent Office, which raised objections in its examination report in January 2014 over obviousness and Section 3(d). The German company filed a response through its agents Remfry &amp; Sagar. Cipla then filed a pre-grant opposition through S Majumdar &amp; Co. Boehringer did not respond to a query sent out by TOI.“The applicant (Boehringer) did not respond to the pre-grant opposition and also did not appear at the hearing fixed for the same on September 15, 2015,” legal sources told TOI. N R Meena, deputy controller of Patents &amp; Designs, said in the order, a copy of which was accessed by TOI, since the applicant did not appear in the hearing fixed under section 25(1) before the controller, and no arguments were offered to rebut the objections raised in the FER (first examination report), and by the opponent, therefore the application for grant of patent is refused.

As Diwali is round the corner, the members have placed small collection boxes and banners at Pothys, a major textile showroom in Madurai for the past three days. 	Also, a team of youngsters tirelessly explained curious shoppers about their initiative to provide new clothes to around 103 children. They will continue the drive till Diwali, they said. 	Speaking about the endeavour, team members B Shaanraj, V Sivabalan, R Arunkumar and A Manojkumar said the response from the public are encouraging. In the past three days, they have received donation of Rs 5000. After hearing about our initiative, some people give new clothes, they said. “Many of them select the children from our list and contribute money asking us to buy new clothes for them,” Shaan raj said. “We should also thank the generosity of the textile showroom for giving us the space,” Sivabalan stated. 	Most of the members, who are studying in various places, have decided to spend their puja holidays in this manner. “Our members have already undertaken similar initiatives in Chennai by collecting money from people. However, in Madurai we have directly put up a collection centre at a textile showroom,” Manojkumar said. 	In most cases, the beneficiaries – HIV-affected children, are either living with single parent as one of the parent has succumbed to AIDS or they live in homes as both parents are dead. “We want to make Diwali a time of celebration for these children. Fifteen members from our forum and volunteers from colleges are participating in this drive,” M Kishore Kumar, one of the coordinators of Padikkattugal said. 	They have collected donors’ contact details and will invite them when they distribute clothes to the children in a small event, which will be organised in the city, he added. "
103,11,2015,Breaking the news to children living with HIV: a non-profit takes the lead in Ecuador,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/Breaking-the-news-to-children-living-with-HIV-a-non-profit-takes-the-lead-in-Ecuador/articleshow/49614514.cms," 	GUAYAQUIL: Jean's book of heroes occupies pride of place at a clinic run by Fundacion VIHDA, a non-profit working to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child in Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil. One would expect illustrations of princes to jump out of the pages of her book. Instead, there are handmade drawings of her grandmother. 	Since her mother's death, Jean, who has tested HIV positive, is being looked after by her grandmother. The biggest concern for families like hers is how to break the news to a child about his/her HIV status. This concern prompted Fundacion VIHDA to come up with a programme for diagnostic disclosure of HIV to children and to prepare them for their life ahead. Two years since, 15 children, having an average age of 10 to 12 years, have completed the programme. 	Globally, 3.2 million children, under the age of 15, were living with HIV in 2013, according to UNAIDS. They comprised 9.1% of all people living with HIV. 240,000 children worldwide acquired HIV in 2013: one new infection every two minutes. 	""A significant number of kids in Ecuador acquire the HIV virus from their mothers who may not have been able to receive treatment on time to prevent transmission to the child. As kids grow up, they start asking questions. They know how to read signs at hospitals and labels on flasks. It is important for the child to know that he is not sick and that he has rights,"" says clinical psychologist Dr. Claudia Zambrano, one of the founding members of Fundacion VIHDA. 	Zambrano and her team have individual sessions, every fortnight, for children living with HIV that approach the clinic. A specific action plan is drawn up based on the personal situation of every child. ""We work with the child's personal history, their specific life circumstances and his/her family, in order to address their needs. The children are taught about wholesome health, just like in school. They are given a general idea about medical conditions, concepts like viral load (amount of HIV in a blood sample), drugs and how they react in the body,"" says Zambrano.Group sessions are held with peers after a couple of months so the child gets a support network. 	Nine-year-old Valentina had stumped a bunch of paramedics at her school when she told them that she had HIV. She had learnt of her diagnosis from her aunt and did not confide in her friends. But when the paramedics started quizzing students about their allergies and medical conditions, Valentina thought it was okay to tell. ""Valentina was nervous when the paramedics spoke to her teachers. I went over to her school and met the authorities. We spoke to Valentina and strengthened the feeling that there was nothing wrong with her,"" said Zambrano. After that episode at school, things changed as Valentina's teachers and principal were more open to the topic. Valentina continued two years more in the same school and is now in college. She comes regularly to the Fundacion VIHDA clinic and discusses updates in her life as a teenager, occasionally attending some of the group sessions held for younger kids living with HIV. 	The diagnostic disclosure programme has no fixed duration. ""Kids come to us at different stages. Some of them approach us in crisis after getting to know of their diagnosis in difficult situations. In such cases, we have to work on repair and stress on the fact that although the HIV status is an integral aspect of the child's life, it does not define him as a person. We seek family support and also counsel families on tackling the situation,"" says a member of the psychological counselling team at Fundacion VIHDA. Children in crisis are burdened with a lot of questions and anxieties. They know they have greater physical restrictions than other kids their age. Some of them fear they would die like their mother did. Others are worried that they would get sick often and may not have money to pay for medication in future. ""Children are taught to keep information about their health situation private and not disclose it to any of their friends or acquaintances. But there have been situations where classmates or teachers have found out and started discriminating against them. In such cases, parents or grandparents are encouraged to deal with the situation firmly as we have laws against discrimination of people living with HIV. The child may change schools to overcome discrimination. They work very hard to regain self-esteem and overcome that episode,"" says Zambrano. 	At Enrique Sotomayor, the largest maternity hospital in Guayaquil where 20% of Ecuador's children are born, a team headed by Dr. Mercedes Ortiz have been fighting to bring down the number of mother-to-child transmissions, despite scarce resources and cultural stigma against HIV. ""The risk of transmission from mother-to-child can occur during pregnancy, breastfeeding or birth. We provide information to all our female patients on why it's important to get tested for HIV and how to prevent transmission of the virus to their babies,"" says Ortiz. 	From the moment of diagnosis, antiretroviral (ARV) medication has to be administered to the pregnant woman and it has to continue indefinitely. Prior to the birth of the child, these ARVs reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream and prevent transmission from mother-to-child. On birth, babies must be given infant antiretrovirals during the first month of their life and they have to remain under medical observation till they are 18.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Genvoya — a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide — as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 and above.READ ALSO:New drug offers potential to keep HIV at bay indefinitely Though the drug is currently not available in India, experts say approval in the US is a major breakthrough and may trigger trials for the medicine in India, which has the third highest number of HIV-infected people in the world. Currently, India has over 20 lakh people living with HIV, while there are around 1.5 lakh children infected with the virus. Though India demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adults, it still witnesses around 1.2 lakh new infections and 1.5 lakh AIDS-related deaths every year. “Today’s approval of a fixed dose combination containing a new form of tenofovir provides another effective, once-daily, complete regimen for patients with HIV-1 infection,” said Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products at USFDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. According to USFDA, Genvoya contains a new form of tenofovir that has not been previously approved. This new form provides lower levels of drug in the bloodstream, but higher levels within the cells, where HIV-1 replicates. “It was developed to help reduce some drug side effects,” the regulator said.READ ALSO: Natural defence against HIV discovered According to USFDA, the new drug also appears to be associated with less kidney toxicity and decreases in bone density than previously approved tenofovir-containing regimens based on laboratory measures. The American regulator has approved the medicine for children weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 pounds) who have never taken HIV therapy and HIV-infected adults whose HIV-1 virus is currently suppressed. The drug, not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, will also carry a ‘Boxed Warning’ alerting patients and healthcare providers that the drug can cause a buildup of lactic acid in the blood and severe liver problems, both of which can be fatal. The ‘Boxed Warning’ also states that Genvoya is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The drug should not be prescribed with other antiretroviral products as it may have drug interactions with a number of other commonly used medications. "

This was a bid to help these children and women live a normal life despite being affected by the immunodeficiency virus. 	In a function organized by the Coimbatore District HIV Ullor Nala Sangam, a set of new clothes and a box of sweets were distributed to around 120 children who have either been infected or affected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Saris and sweets were also distributed to 80 women, who were widowed and infected with the virus. 	The function which began with gift distribution, also included a celebratory lunch and a couple of confidence building speeches. People were not allowed to photograph or video tape the event because many children and women were there without their family, friends or neighbours’ knowledge. “Though we organize the function to always convince HIV affected people that they can lead a normal life, in reality it is very difficult,” said a senior member of the sangam R Meenakshi. “A majority of the people, infected by HIV, who attended the function on Saturday, live completely anonymous lives. The children’s classmates and friends usually do not know their status, the women’s colleagues and neighbours too do not know that they are infected,” she said. “The minute word gets out that they are infected, they face a lot of discrimination and ostracization,” she said. “This is the only time they can admit to being affected by HIV and yet have a nice time,” she added. 	The clothes and the sweets were sponsored by four good samaritans who have been contributing to this function for the past 13 years. “This is the 13th year that we are celebrating this function,” said Meenakshi.

Known as a silent killer, about 15 cases of the HIV-2 strain have been detected in Goa in the last two years. As with HIV-1, the mode of transmissions of HIV-2 is through sex and from mother-to-child during pregnancy. The medication for both the strains differ. Confirming the developments of the HIV-2 strain, Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, anti-retroviral therapy centre’s (ART) senior medical officer, Dr Vanda Viegas said, “It is a worrying factor as the detection of HIV-2 is not as easy as HIV-1. The strain can remain undetected in the body for five-six years.” “HIV-2 virus will not cause any harm to the person for few years, but after that the decline in the health of the carrier is steady,” Viegas said. If a person doesn’t get treatment on time, she said, early death is imminent. Asked what could have triggered the HIV-2 cases in the state, Viegas said it cannot be pinpointed without thorough research, and that the new cases have been reported to the higher authorities. Of the 15 HIV-2 cases detected, Viegas said ten were migrants including a South Indian couple. Quite a few cases of HIV-2 strain have been detected in some states in South India. She said the South Indian couple was put on a therapy – protease inhibitors, a type of antiviral drug, and though initially showed to be responding, they stopped visiting ART centre on the scheduled dates. “We don’t know whether they are dead or alive,” she added. In fact, this is a typical problem faced by the ART centre as some of the patients registered for treatment don’t show up after the first few visits. The problem is more so with migrants who disappear after the first few visits. The officials at the ART centre find it difficult to locate them as they lack proper addresses."

Since the cancellation of his sitcom ‘Anger Management’ last year, the 50-year old star has rarely appeared on-screen. But on Tuesday morning, he will sit-down for an interview with Matt Lauer, the host of NBC's Today programme. NBC did not disclose any further details of the announcement in a release heralding the exclusive interview, but US tabloid 'The National Enquirer' has claimed in a cover story for its 18 November issue that Mr Sheen is HIV positive. TMZ has also reported that sources close to NBC believed Mr Sheen would reveal the alleged diagnosis during his meeting with Mr Lauer.READ: Charlie Sheen is hoping to return to 'Two and a Half Men' Sheen was once the highest paid actor on US television, reportedly earning some $1.8m (£1.2m) per episode as the star of 'Two and a Half Men', until his career spiralled out of control due to a combination of cocaine addiction, erratic behaviour, an outrageous personal life (including multiple allegations of domestic abuse) and Charlie’s public criticism of the show’s creator, Chuck Lorre.

In fact, doctors and NGOs dealing with HIV+ adolescents are faced with new problems, such as how to explain and make HIV-affected children understand that they need to lead a controlled life as they become adults. That they will not be able to enjoy life on par with their counterparts. Many of them think “being HIV” means they will die soon and are in a hurry to live life to the fullest extent such as partying hard or being in a relationship. Dr Vanda Viegas, senior medical officer at ART center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, said though they have had good results with children, who were put on ART since the centre started in the year 2005, they are now posed with more complex problems. “The problem is getting more complicated as most are orphans brought up in the orphanages and are now on their own,” she said. They have similar urges and desires like other adolescents of their age, but, the only difference is that they have a deadly ailment. There is also a tendency among HIV-positive children to give up education once they learn about their disease. “They want to freak out and do everything possible before death catches up with them,” said Viegas. Though some may be keen to do higher studies, she said they might not excel for the disease is likely to affect their IQ. Few are into college education, nonetheless. Peter Borges, secretary, Positive People, an NGO working for people afflicted with HIV/AIDS, said life for such children is not easy. Last week, a three-day workshop was held in Valpoi for HIV children,, who were informed about their ailment and were counselled on various aspects. They were also informed about various career options and how to go about it, and also given tips on stress management. A counsellor, who has been counselling HIV patients, for a while, said counselling children with HIV is a tough job. Children with no parents or parents or a guardian going astray are high once they grasp the magnitude of their disease fully. “They want to be like other youth. Though we do warn them about perils of their action, we suspect some get into relationship without revealing to their partners about their ailment,” he said. Viegas said, in recent times, she has come across three-four cases wherein relatives of HIV-positive girls got them married outside Goa. “In none of the cases, the groom or his family was informed about the HIV status of the bride,” she pointed out. The end result has been tragic. After marriage, the girls stopped taking ART to hide the disease, and consequently progression of HIV virus in them was faster. “They wanted to hide their ailment from their families, but, the arrangement didn’t work. They were thrown out by their respective families,” she pointed out. When some reported back at the ART center, they were in stage four, with full blown AIDS."

Here is an 'open letter' from Charlie Sheen on his diagnosis.An open letter from Charlie Sheen: Roughly four years ago, I suddenly found myself in the throws of a seismic and debilitating three-day cluster-migraine-like headache. I was emergently hospitalized with what I believed to be a brain tumor or perhaps some unknown pathology. I was partially correct. Following a battery of endless tests, that included a hideous spinal tap, it was sadly and shockingly revealed to me that I was, in fact, positive for HIV.The news was a ""mule kick"" to my soul. Those impossible words I absorbed and then tried to convince myself, that I was stuck, suspended, or even stranded inside some kind of alternate reality or nightmare, were to the absolute contrary. I was awake. It was true… reality. Under the brilliant and perfect care of Dr. Robert Huizenga as well as ""the"" leading infectious disease expert in the known universe, I began a rigorous and intensive treatment program. Not missing a beat, a med dose, or one shred of guidance, quickly my viral loads became undetectable. Like every other challenge in my life, again, I was victorious and kicking this disease's ass. I wish my story had ended there. Unfortunately, for my family and myself, it had only just begun. (As quoted by today.com)The personal disbelief, karmic confusion, shame and anger lead to a temporary yet abysmal descent into profound substance abuse and fathomless drinking. It was a suicide run. Problem was, I'd forgotten that I'm too tough for such a cowardly departure. Yet, despite this loathsome and horrific odyssey, I was vigilant with my anti-viral program.READ: Charlie Sheen says he is HIV positive My medical team could only shake their heads as each and every blood test returned levels revealing a state of remission. Even though I might have been trying to kill myself, one thing was radically evident; the disease was not. In and around this perplexing and difficult time, I dazedly chose (or hired) the companionship of unsavory and insipid types. Regardless of their salt-less reputations, I always lead with condoms and honesty when it came to my condition. Sadly, my truth soon became their treason, as a deluge of blackmail and extortion took center stage in this circus of deceit. To date, I have paid out countless millions to these desperate charlatans. Locked in a vacuum of fear, I chose to allow their threats and skulduggery to vastly deplete future assets from my children, while my ""secret"" sat entombed in their hives of folly (or so I thought). News Flash: This ends today. I'm claiming back my freedom. The scales of justice will swiftly and righteously re-balance themselves. In conclusion, I accept this condition not as a curse or scourge, but rather as an opportunity and a challenge. An opportunity to help others. A challenge to better myself. Every day, of every month, of every year, countless individuals go to work, man their stations, fulfill their professional obligations with a host of disabilities. Diseases, imperfections, hurdles, detours. These maladies range from lupus to cancer, from paralysis to blindness, from diabetes to obesity. ""Treated,"" HIV is no different.My partying days are behind me. My philanthropic days are ahead of me. Ernest Hemingway once wrote, ""Courage is grace under pressure."" I've served my time under pressure; I now embrace the courage, and the grace.Love and peace, Charlie Sheen Read Charlie Sheen faces backlash after racist Obama tweet.

Immediately after Sheen announced that he’s HIV positive, Magic Johnson tweeted: “I wish @CharlieSheen and his family the best. With the advancement in treatments and medicine he can fight this disease and live a long life. In breaking his silence, I hope he joins me in educating the world about HIV/AIDs.”Holly Johnson The former Frankie Goes to Hollywood frontman was diagnosed with the illness in 1991 and thought he would be the latest in a long line of famous faces who fell victim to AIDS. However, he has fought for his health tooth and nail and survived. Although it’s not exactly been a bed of roses. He confessed in an interview: “I live like a nun. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I haven’t done for years. I take copious amounts of vitamins and medications. I do everything possible to support my health. But I’m not whining about it, and I never will.”Greg Louganis Olympic diver Greg Louganis was diagnosed with HIV at 28 and he has gone on record to say that he didn’t think he would survive beyond 30. Fit and fine at 55, now he has put the criticism levied at him for his head injury in 1988 Olympics behind him, wherein he was accused of putting divers to the risk of HIV.

Viruses are indiscriminate and opening up the dialogue and especially being in the public’s eye is a positive thing,” he said in an interview.Mondo Guerra Mexican-American fashion designer Mondo Guerra has been breaking barriers and stigmas regarding living with HIV ever since coming out as positive five years ago on Project Runway. While the 38-year-old Denver native is very open about living with HIV now, it wasn’t always the case.“It was hard for me to have this revelation and tell my story because I was scared. I felt very ashamed. I was very embarrassed,” he said in an interview and added, “When I was diagnosed with HIV, I felt like I had failed, so it was very hard for me to talk about it.” For latest Hollywood updates, follow us on Twitter &gt;&gt;&gt;@TOIEntertain For the latest in Hollywood news, like us on Facebook &gt;&gt;&gt;TOIEntertainDanny Pintauro The child star of 80s sitcom Who’s the boss, Pintauro was applauded after opening up about his HIV-positive diagnosis recently at Oprah’s show.

111,11,2015,HIV+ boy driven out of school in Kolkata,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/HIV-boy-driven-out-of-school-in-Kolkata/articleshow/49838485.cms,"KOLKATA: A seven-year-old boy has been hounded out of a private school in southern suburb Bishupur by guardians of other students after his mother voluntarily declared that he was HIV+. The student—Shaan—has been studying in the Bengali-medium Deepsikha Nursery School that has students up to class III. The child's mother, ironically an NGO worker engaged in HIV awareness, has resolved that if her son does continue studies, it will be at Deepsikha or not at all. The grandmother, who is a Bengali teacher in the very school, had to undergo HIV test to prove she was not a carrier before being allowed to continue. Shaan's mother Sujata learned about his condition mid-January when he was tested after she herself had tested positive the previous month. Her husband Sanjit had earlier been detected HIV+ in May 2014. Though devastated by the test result, Sujata who is engaged in awareness on HIV and AIDS for an NGO decided to immediately inform the school headmaster on ethical grounds. “Since my son studies with others, it is important that the teachers know about it so that if he is hurt and suffers a cut leading to blood loss, he is handled carefully and does not infect others. Sanjib Naskar, the headmaster, was extremely nice and assured me that he would personally ensure that Shaan did not face any trouble,” she recounted. Life carried on as usual till June when Sujata received a bolt from the blue. Naskar called her one day and told her that her son could not study in the school any longer as other guardians were opposed to it. “I didn't even know that word had got around and everyone knew Shaan's condition. When I reminded the headmaster about the assurance, he pleaded helplessness as he was under pressure. No amount of reasoning helped,” she said. Though Sujata did send him to school the following day, he was not allowed entry. Shaan has stayed home since. Sujata alleged that a school teacher even telephoned her and rebuked her for trying to questioning the headmaster's decision. “No one has any idea about HIV. When I tried to explain that other kids were not at threat, they refused to listen and remained adamant,” she said. The ingorance is such that Shaan's grandmother, a Bengali teacher in the school, was forced to undergo blood tests and allowed to continue only after the results were negative. When TOI asked the headmaster why he had reneged on his assurance, Naskar did a U-turn and said that he hadn't shut the door on Shaan but had only informed his mother about the objections from other guardians. “I want him to attend school but the parents are not sending him. But it is true that over 100 guardians signed a petition and submitted to me for Shaan's removal from the school,” he said. On an after-thought, Naskar added that the child's fees were also due for several months. Sujata acknowledged that fees had not been paid for several months but claimed it was because the headmaster had waived the fees. District magistrate PB Saleem said he was aware of the mother's complaint and had asked the block development officer to conduct a thorough enquiry into it to ascertain the facts. “Whatever be the case, the child's education must not be affected. I will do whatever it takes to get him back to school,” he said. "

READ: Charlie Sheen says he is HIV positive She also explained that she took pre-exposure prophylaxis before they had sex, to lower her risk of HIV infection. When the host asked if having sex with Sheen was like playing Russian Roulette, Bruce said, “If I had met him on one night, and we had decided to engage in this, I’d say, ‘That’s Russian Roulette’. The reality is, we had known each other for many months before we engaged in (sexual relations), and we were a couple, I was in love with him.” On why she decided to engage in sexual intercourse with the HIV-positive actor, she added, “We had unprotected sex when we decided to be exclusive. When you really love someone you want to get close to them. That was something I wanted to share with him.” Following their split, the two remain close and are no longer sexually active with one another.

Talking to TOI, President of CNP+, Rinki Arora said the orphan child, who was living with his relatives in Durg, was on first line treatment but due to failure of medicines, he was referred to Raipur ART centre one year back. Rinki said since Raipur ART has the facility of providing second line drugs in the state, they had been pursuing the matter with them for the child’s treatment but the same was being delayed on one pretext or the other. She said due to lack of treatment, the child’s condition had started worsening and they contacted State AIDS Control Society (SACS), Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, who in turn directed the Raipur ART centre on Wednesday to start the treatment the very next day. Rinki said when they contacted the ART on Thursday morning, they were asked to get the child on Nov 24, despite being told about his critical condition. She said the child succumbed to his infection on Thursday afternoon. Blaming the ART for the child’s death, Rinki said for the past one year the child was denied treatment despite follow ups with the authorities. She said this is not the first such case and claimed that seven other HIV patients have died due to the same reasons. When TOI contacted Dr Binjhwar, he denied the allegations and said, “Apparently there was some communication gap”, Insisting that the child was not denied medication or treatment, Binjhwar said the child’s relatives were asked to bring him to the ART on Thursday but they never came. When asked why the child was denied treatment for this long despite being referred to the ART for second line treatment over a year back, Binjhwar said the patient’s report of viral load test, which was sent to Kolkata, had not been received so far. He said this report, which measures the number of HIV virus particles in a milliliter of blood, is essential for deciding the correct dosage for the patient. However, Binjhwar admitted that medicines could have been provided to the child, under expert guidance, since he was in a critical condition. "
114,11,2015,'.59% of migrant populace tests HIV positive in Rajasthan',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/-59-of-migrant-populace-tests-HIV-positive-in-Rajasthan/articleshow/49868620.cms," 	JAIPUR: The voluntary health camps organised for HIV screening among migratory population, from October 26 to November 6, showed distressing figures. 	The prevalence of HIV is almost double in villages with high migratory population in comparison to the average number of HIV cases in the state. 	“During the screening for HIV among migratory population, we found that 0.59% was affected with HIV. However, confirmatory tests are yet to be done. All those tested HIV positive during screening were advised to undergo second and third round of confirmatory tests,“ a Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) official said. 	The HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) 2010-11, released recently, showed that the prevalence of HIV AIDS has increased from 0.19% (in 2008-09) to 0.32% in 2010-11. Now, the health authorities have expressed concern over the high percentage of HIV cases among migratory population. 	According to the official, they screened 20,037 persons for HIV during the 10day camps organised in 100 different villages of 11 districts. The villages were identified on the basis of large number of people migrating to other states for work and returning during festive season. 	In terms of numbers, the official said that they found 119 persons who tested positive for HIV during the screening. He said that these 119 persons were not even aware that they were infected with HIV . 	He said that migratory population is always at risk of having HIV . It is a high risk group as they have to stay outside their homes for a long period without their spouses to earn livelihood. 	Accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers helped RSACS in identifying 100 villages with high migratory population. 	Apart from HIV screening, the camps were organised for health check-up.There were doctors in the camps who provided consultation to the persons who visited the camps. 	The 100 identified villages are situated in 11 districts -Barmer, Bhilwara, Chittorgarh, Dungarpur, Jalore, Pali, Rajsamand, Sirohi, Udaipur, Sikar and Jhunjhunu. "
115,11,2015,HIV+ child to return to school,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/HIV-child-to-return-to-school/articleshow/49876515.cms,"KOLKATA: A couple of days after The Times of India reported on the plight of an HIV+ seven-year-old child from Bishnupur, who has been denied entry to the private school where he was studying after his mother disclosed his health condition to the headmaster, the South 24-Parganas administration on Saturday persuaded most of the other guardians that there was no danger to their wards if this boy studied with them. 	Not all the parents were convinced, but after several rounds of discussions, about 80% agreed, say sources. They indicated this by their silence, though. It was enough for a “unanimous decision” for the child will return to school from Monday. 	On Thursday, TOI had reported that the child, whose parents are HIV+, was detected as a carrier of the virus in January. Instead of keeping the matter hidden, his mother — who works as a volunteer in HIV awareness — informed principal Sanjib Naskar. She felt that school authorities need to know and take necessary precautions should the boy hurt himself and bleed. Handling HIV+ blood without necessary precautions can result in spreading of the virus. 	Things were fine till June when Naskar informed the child’s mother that several guardians have submitted a petition, demanding that her son’s name be struck off the rolls. The boy’s grandmother, who teaches in the same school, was made to undergo a test to prove that she is not an HIV carrier. Naskar, however, told TOI that the child’s mother was raising the issue after the school demanded that she pay up pending fees The woman countered that it was Naskar who had waived the fees. 	On coming to know of the issue, South 24-Parganas district magistrate P B Saleem promised to ensure that the boy gets to study in that very school. On Saturday, he called a meeting of guardians and teachers. This was attended by Alipore SDO Praloy Majumder, the district chief medical officer-health, MLA Dilip Mondal and several NGO members who work with HIV patients. 	After the medical experts and NGOs spoke on HIV+ and how it doesn’t spread through normal day-to -day activities, some parents still expressed their reservations. They asked the experts whether they would have said the same had their children studied in that school. Many demanded that the boy be isolated in a classroom. About 80% started out protesting the inclusion. In the end though, two parents spoke of behalf of everyone and said they have no problem if the boy studies in the school provided he has a special maid to look after him. 	Naskar then brought up the issue of pending fees, saying the boy had not paid his dues for two years. Local MLA Dilip Mondal and social worker Sailen Ghosh said they would clear the dues and arrange for a special maid, thereby clearing the path for the child’s education. "

The friend from over two decades ago, was trying to give his old buddy de-addiction treatment. The HIV positive man is said to have done this to avenge this 'care' shown by his friend. 	The incident occurred late on Sunday night when Zaheer Modan (37) was going to drop his HIV infected friend to his home in Juhapura when the latter pushed the syringe into Modan. Feeling the pain, Modan asked his friend about it and later found the used syringe from the man's pockets. The drug-addicted man also confessed to having pinched the syringe. 	According to Modan, Ehsan (name changed) was his friend for 22 years. Five years ago, Ehsan went to New Zeeland for work but he had started consuming hashish and other drugs there. Under the influence of drugs, he once fought with his employer and landed in jail for two years. After completion of his sentence, the New Zealand government deported Ehsan to India. 	Ehsan did not leave his drug habit. He soon started taking drugs using syringes. His father died from the shock and his mother went insane. She was later taken to New Zealand by Ehsan's sister. 	Modan stayed with Ehsan like a family-member and even admitted his friend to a de-addiction centre a couple of time. Ehsan did not stay the course and left the treatment programme without completing it. 	Modan said Ehsan came to his house two days ago and told him that he had started working with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), but as he was not paid for two months, he had vandalized his employer's office which led to a police complaint being lodged against him. He pleaded with Modan to help him get anticipatory bail. 	On Sunday Modan had advised Ehsan to go to the concerned police station and assured him that they would secure his bail later. Modan again advised him to get over his addiction if he really wanted to avoid troubles in his life. After their conversation, Ehsan asked Modan to leave him at a rickshaw-stop on his bike. According to Modan, a common friend had once told him to let Ehsan remain in jail for some time so that he could leave his addiction. Ehsan had kept this in mind, and it led him to commit the heinous act. "

In fact, Ranga Reddy registered 902 fresh HIV positive cases with a prevalence rate of 2.49%, followed by Hyderabad with 819 new HIV positive cases at a prevalence rate of 2.17%. Further, during the March 2014 to March 2015 period, 14,548 new HIV cases were detected of the total of 77,893 people, who were tested for the disease in Telangana with a prevalence rate of 1.84%. 	This startling data was revealed by officials of the Telangana State Aids Contro l Society on the sidelines of a World AIDS Day event, organized by United States Consulate General, Hyderabad on Friday evening to honour both private and public sector health practitioners involved in the prevention of HIVAIDS. 	Given the grim situation at hand, TSACs clearly will have a tough time in achieving the `Getting to zero' target ­ incidentally the theme of World AIDS Day-2015 to be observed on December 1. “In order to achieve the goal, we need to reach out to people who have not undergone the HIV test yet by taking up activities like education and communication (IEC), besides providing treatment and counselling to those who tested positive,“ said Dr John Babu, additional project director, TSACS. However, NGOs and health practitioners working on prevention of HIVAIDS, who attended the recent event in the city , said that there were several challenges that needed to be met before reaching the destination. “The syllabus being taught to medicos will not provide them with an opportunity to gain hands on experience on treatment of HIV patients. This has resulted in decline in interest among general physicians to practice HIV medicine,“ said Dr Dinakar, director, internal medicine, Sunshine Hospital. 	Similarly , Swapna, vice-president of the NGO Telugu Network of People Living with HIVAIDS working in the states of Telangana and AP, said how the civil society's failure in shunning the stigma attached to HIV patients is proving to be a blockade in providing treatment to them. “I took a bold step in 2003 when I revealed my HIV positive status. Now, our NGO has a network of three lakh positive people in the two states,“ said Swapna. 	Meanwhile, earlier in his address, Michael C Mullins, consul general, consulate general of the United States of America, Hyderabad, said that U S President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is working closely with the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) in various areas of HIV AIDS prevention in India like drugs, treatment, testing etc. 	“It's time to act now. Under PEPFAR, the US government has so far spent around $65 billion on programmes globally to combat HIV and AIDS,“ he said. "
119,11,2015,‘Drugs for all HIV patients not feasible’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Drugs-for-all-HIV-patients-not-feasible/articleshow/49975011.cms,"MUMBAI: The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has made it clear that India is not ready to adhere to WHO’s recent recommendation of providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV patients regardless of their disease stage. 	Till now, in India, only those with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 are started under the ART programme. The NACO, for the first time in over a decade, has decided that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs will now be offered to even those with a slightly higher CD4 count of 500. CD4 cell count is a crucial marker of how aggressively the virus is destroying the body’s immune system. 	“We have to look into the evidence of starting ART for all. More than evidence, it is operational feasibility, finances, human resource and how the ART centres will cope with the increased load of more patients,” said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer (ART), NACO. On WHO’s recommendations, he said the guidelines are never meant to be adopted immediately. “It is expected to take a year or two,” he said. 	With the tweaking of CD4 requirement, over 2-3lakh HIV patients, who earlier did not qualify for the free ART therapy, are likely to be brought under its ambit. Currently, only 8 lakh people in the country are on the ART programme, even though the total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated to be 21 lakh. 	Physicians firmly believe that the way forward is early initiation of ART in all adults, adolescents and children with HIV. Dr George Oomen, infectious diseases specialist, said there is ample evidence to show that people who have started ART at their highest CD4 count, be it 750 or 1,000, do best. 	Head of medicine at Parel’s KEM Hospital Dr AR Pazare reiterated, “That is the way world is treating HIV. Why wait for the person to become too sick or for his CD4 count to fall so much?” He said early ART can not only stop progression of disease but also cut down on transmission. 	Parallel to the CD4 debate is that of providing oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent acquisition of HIV. Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar trust, that works with men having sex with men, said PrEP has been in use in India for the last few years, but its inclusion in national programme may not be a reality soon. “There is an ideological debate on whether to provide ART to gay men as a preventive drug or first reach out to all women and kids,” he added. Rewari said PrEp is being tried as a pilot study among female sex workers in Chennai, Mysore and Kolkata. "

The first 29 years were marked with victory as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) metamorphosed from being the deadliest word in public health to just another chronic disease such as diabetes or hypertension. that can be managed well with medicines. But experts warn that complacency, accompanied by a sharp drop in funding, could prove to be costly for India. Consider Mumbai for instance. HIV among the city's general population fell from 3.6% in 2013-14 to 3% in 2014-15.But the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) that manages health programmes for HIV+ AIDS people has been managing with a third of its annual budget of Rs 25 crore. ""Medicines have had a marvellous effect on the HIVAIDS epidemic so far. Every patient who has managed to get these medicines has not done poorly But we could head for big trouble if patients don't adhere to drugs or fail to get it in time,"" said infectious diseases specialist Dr George Oomen. The country has faced a stockout of HIV drugs in the past few years. Indeed, while year-on-year, incidence of new infection among the general population and pregnant women has shown a significant decline, that among risk groups continues to be a cause for concern. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance data of 2010-11, HIV among female sex workers in the city was around 6%, way higher than the national prevalence of 2.7%. However, the main sentiment on the eve of World AIDS Day is of positivity. ""What is the difference between HIV in 1985 and 2015? HIV+ people don't really frighten others anymore,"" said Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar Trust, one of the first organisations started in the country to advocate for rights of men who have sex with men (MSM). ""People are living a prolonged life with antiretroviral therapy (ART),"" he said. Our biggest achievement is that we have killed the fear."" Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS, said, ""We have come from a stage when HIV prevalence in Kamathipura was 54.3% in 2003. Today, the awareness is massive and everyone knows about ways of prevention."" Mumbai currently has over 30,000 people living with the disease. A senior NGO member , who worked with FSWs in Kamathipura, said the disease is no longer a death sentence. ""We probably don't even know how many women must have died of AIDS. It is a rare thing today."" But a doctor said the Indian program faces problems that government officials aren't ready to accept. so far. ""Less than a tenth of those who need second -line HIV drugs access them under the government programme. These patients will not only develop further resistance but even spread the disease in the community,"" hes aid. He added the happy picture could crumble in a few years at the rate it's progressing. ""The Centre has washed it hands of funding HIV AIDS programmes and states haven't realised their importance."" "

Infections among young people have become particularly noticeable, as 2,662 new cases of students living with HIV/AIDS were reported from January to October, a surge of 27.8 per cent year on year, the CDC said. 	Some 97,000 new cases in total were reported in the period. 	World AIDS day is celebrated on December 1 to unite people to fight against HIV virus, first identified in 1984. "
124,11,2015,Doon care centre for HIV/AIDS patients shuts,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/Doon-care-centre-for-HIV/AIDS-patients-shuts/articleshow/49996795.cms," 	DEHRADUN: For Anjali Antaral (13), an orphan and AIDS patient who is a resident of Tehri, it is worrisome that the lone community care centre for AIDS patients in Dehradun shut down on Monday. This is the centre she has been visiting for tests for three years; she also received her medicines from the hospital here. Now, her future hangs in balance. 	“I don’t know how I will manage my treatment now. I had a proper place to stay at and healthy food to eat whenever I went to Dehradun. We want the chief minister to come forward and support the only community centre that was supportive of HIV/AIDS patients,” Antaral told TOI. 	Many other children with little support from society or families found help at this centre. The cash-starved centre has now received no help from the state government either, despite the very commendable service it has rendered. 	The community centre was established in 2009 under the aegis of National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), to provide free residential facilities and nutritional food to people living with HIV/AIDS, including women and children. About 2000 patients avail the facility annually. The centre was run by the Agnes Kunj Society (AKS). 	In just this financial year, over 370 people have visited the centre; half of these were children. 	The state government holds the Centre responsible for the shutting down of this facility, as it drew funds from NACO. Officials at AKS, who manage the facility, said the expenses incurred at the centre are just about Rs18 lakh per year – a sum the state government should not find so hard to shell out. 	Neera Kumari (27), an HIV-positive woman, has been travelling for the past five years from Chamoli (275 km from Dehradun) with her husband, who is also HIV-positive. The couple would get their medicines from here before returning home. 	“This was one place where we did not feel discriminated against. We were not alone here – there were about 15 couples we would meet once in a while who availed the services. The health department needs to think about getting another facility opened, if this must shut. Either open up AIDS medicine or test centres in each block or get us a proper community centre like AKS,” Kumari said. 	Kailash Joshi, who works as head of administration at the health directorate, told TOI, “There is nothing to be done. We are trying to get things working. I cannot say much, I joined this post only recently.” 	Officials had met the chief minister in this matter on November 23, but no resolution was found. Meanwhile, patients complain that although the chief minister and the health officials talk of providing free transport and social security numbers, there is little help forthcoming when they actually need help. 	Lawrence Singh, project coordinator at Agnes Kunj Society, said, “We tried to offer the best services possible. Now, even our resources have run out. Our centre was used not only by local people but also residents of neighbouring states like UP and Himachal. It would be nice if the health department understood the condition of patients not accepted in their own families and society. We had so many patients come here for a place to stay and get good food. They came for treatment and counselling, and some were really small children.” "
125,11,2015,Maha’s youngsters worst hit by new HIV infections in 2014-15,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Mahas-youngsters-worst-hit-by-new-HIV-infections-in-2014-15/articleshow/49988029.cms,"Mumbai: Young people in Maharashtra aged 18-35 accounted for a substantial number of new HIV infections in 2014-15. Agricultural labourers and housewives were among the majority to be infected, highlighting the need for strengthening the HIV programme, which is going through a severe fund crunch. An analysis by the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) found that young people contributed to 42% fresh infections, while 6% were adolescents. It showed that 28,925 people tested positive for HIV out of the 21.37 lakh tested. Despite a constant decline in new infections across the state, young adults and adolescents, particularly in rural pockets, continue to be the most vulnerable due to lack of adequate knowledge or access to it. Women accounted for 56% new infections, while it was 43% among men and 1% in the transgender community. But the trend in Mumbai is the opposite, where most infections are still seen in men, and only 36% are detected in women. The study showed how education played a pivotal role in an individual getting the infection. About 29% who contracted the virus were illiterate and 35% had primary education. The graph dropped to 28% among those who completed secondary education and to 8% for those with college degrees and above. Infectious disease consultant Dr Om Srivastava said people in their early teens and pre-20s are the most vulnerable due to limited access to information or resources. “There is an element of irresponsibility for those beyond 20-22 as they have access to funds, resources and information,” he said. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) president Dr Sagar Mundada said pre-marital testing should be promoted on a larger scale. The highest infection (42%) was detected in the 36-50 age group. Incidentally, a year-on-year increase in this age group has been noted in Kolhapur. HIV in the 51-60 age group stood at 8% and among senior citizens 3%. Dr Shobhna Tehra of MSACS said, “The disease is well under control. Our testing has doubled and infections have halved.” Fresh infections have declined by 45% over the last five years in the city. Among the newly-infected, 78% are aged 15-49, said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). Around 93% of the infections were due to unsafe sex. But an expert said, “The cloud of uncertainty has to be cleared from the programme that is struggling with demotivated workers and high attrition.” The MSACS has received only Rs 11.89 crore for the year despite having an approved budget of Rs 104.73 crore from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO)."
126,12,2015,Wives make HIV certificate must for husbands in UP village,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Wives-make-HIV-certificate-must-for-husbands-in-UP-village/articleshow/49989294.cms,"UDAISARAI (FATEHPUR): This Diwali wasn’t the same for Anita, a mother of two in this village. When her husband – who works in Mumbai to provide for his family – came back home this Diwali, she insisted on an HIV test before he entered home. But, her husband wouldn’t agree. So, Anita decided he would not let him share her bed till he was in Udaisarai. Vidya, another resident of this village and a mother of two, too would not allow her husband Ram Kishore enter home till a blood test showed he was HIV negative. Not that Anita and Vidya were not happy that their husbands were home for Diwali. But, they were scared that they could get with them more them the money and Diwali gifts for all. They were afraid the men may get them disease and death – carrying back home with them the deadly HIV. The women in this village, where most make members work in Mumbai for a living, have united and are fighting this virus in a unique way: They are making the menfolk – through persuasion and even force – under a test to check for HIV as soon as they reach the village from Mumbai. Their fears aren’t misplaced. For, Udaisarai was like any other village in Uttar Pradesh – surviving on income from agriculture and money orders from men working in Mumbai and other cities in western India – till a screening camp 10 years ago made their world turn topsy turvy. Results of blood tests in the camp revealed most of the males were carrying the deadly virus. The village, with a population … and with members from about 200 homes working in other states, has lost as many as 44 people in the past decade. With death staring them in the face, women have taken strong steps. And, if the wives are ensuring HIV tests for husbands and safe sex, they are being supported by their mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. “We are helping them save themselves from the scourge of infection and stigma. This Diwali, the women told the men to get themselves tested for HIV when the returned home,” said Gyan Swaroopa, an anganwadi worker who has played a key role in spreading awareness in the village. It was Vidya who took the lead and made her husband undergo a blood test at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the Fatehpur district hospital. “I have seen members of families which got infected die one by one. Even medicines do not work. The trauma is unbearable. So, I asked my husband to get himself checked,” said Vidya. But not all spouses are cooperative. Anita had to struggle to make her husband take the test. “I did not let him into my room for two days as he refused to take the test. I even did not let him share my bed for the rest of the days,” she said. “It was my mother-in-law who made him agree, reminding him of the deaths village have died. Village elders too convinced him and he donated his sample before leaving for Mumbai. The report is awaited,” she added. When Sangeeta’s husband came home for Diwali, it was her sister-in-law, who herself had lost her husband, who convinced him for the test. Sangeeta’s family heaved a sigh of relief when he turned out to be HIV negative. Sangeeta had stopped communicating with her husband till he agreed. But, when Rekha, who was married just about six months ago, could not convince her husband for the test, she ensured that he used condoms. But not all had it easy. When another resident Rani Devi insisted that her husband underwent a test, he retorted: “Tum humko bataogi ki kya karna hai (Will you tell me what I should do?).” ASHA worker Karuna Devi said threat of importing HIV infection from Mumbai still looms over the hamlet. Village head Dharam Raj revealed that at least 250 residents from 200 families worked in Mumbai and came back home only on festivals. “No one knows what these men do when they are far away, living alone. We counsel youth and men when they leave Fatehpur for work. The stand taken by the women of the village is laudable,” said village pradhan Dharam Raj. Elders who work in Mumbai also keep an eye on the younger men. “Instead of staying on the streets, we get together and pool in money to rent common rooms. This has minimized men visiting commercial sex workers,” said Ramesh Kumar, who has been working in Mumbai since 1999. Social organisations working in HIV prevention in the village are also helping empower women. President of Nehru Yuva Sangathan, Rajendra Sahu said: “Women are better change-makers than anyone else. An aware woman force in the village has checked the rate of new cases in the past few years.” STATS 357 cases of HIV reported in Fatehpur in 2005-15. Of these 48 cases were reported last year In Udaisarai village, 52 HIV reactive cases came to fore in a health camp held in 2005 As many as 44 persons, including five families, have died in this period As on date, 12 patients of HIV are undergoing treatment Risk of TB looms large over most patients hereRead this story in Hindi: पत्नियां अड़ीं, HIV रिपोर्ट के बिना पतियों को नो एंट्री"

FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO) Lucknow Kanpur Chapter, in a unique collaboration with Uttar Pradesh AIDS control society (UPSACS) will be creating livelihood for HIV-positive and HIV affected women. According to data, there are around 37,045 HIV positive women in the state. The age group these women generally belong to is 18-25 years and then 25-35 and it coincides with their reproductive age. “This is also the time they are employed or are seeking jobs, but the stigma of AIDS in the society acts as a barrier in their employment,” said Dayanand Kumar Gupta from Uttar Pradesh welfare for people living with HIV/AIDS society (UPNPplus) under UPSACS. Meeting around 50-HIV positive women from Lucknow to survey their interests and aspiration to work, chairperson of FLO’s Lucknow Kanpur chapter Jyotsana Kaur Habibullah said, “Through the initiative, we want to empower these women. From here we will try to bring corporate employment to those interested in that sector and provide sewing machines or help setting up a business for those who want to be self-employed.” Another FLO member Roma Agarwal said they will also try to get state intervention in providing money to HIV/AIDS affected women. “Other state governments provide Rs 500 a month and we will talk to the UP government for similar relief,” she said. Care, support and treatment, UPSACS joint director Dr A K Singha, believed such an intiative will create awareness and jobs for the women. Dr Priti Pathak, state epidemiologist UPSACS informed that even though these women are ready to go for treatment after much counseling, there are no jobs which FLO will be able to get."

The report 'Adolescents: Under the Radar in the Asia-Pacific AIDS Response', published by the Asia-Pacific Inter-Agency Task Team on Young Key Populations, which includes UNICEF and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS warned that the AIDS epidemic cannot be ended as a public health threat by 2030 without tackling the issue of adolescents. 	In 2014, 220,000 adolescents aged 10-19 were estimated to be living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific. 	India is among the 10 countries in the region accounting for 98 per cent of those aged 10 to 19 living with HIV. 	The other countries are Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. 	Prevalence is particularly high in large cities like Mumbai, Hanoi, Jakarta, Bangkok, Chiang Mai and other urban areas. 	The 2014 figure accounts for almost 15 per cent of all new cases in the region. 	Although new infections are falling overall, they are rising among adolescents, coinciding with an increase in risky behaviour, such as multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use. 	The report, released ahead of World AIDS Day on Tuesday, added that in hotspot urban areas, HIV prevalence can be many times the national prevalence. 	In general, female sex workers in Asia and the Pacific are 29 times more likely to be living with HIV compared with all women of reproductive age, according to a global systematic review in low and middle-income countries. 	""The Asia-Pacific region is facing a hidden epidemic of HIV among adolescents, with an estimated 50,000 new infections in 2014 among those aged 15 to 19,"" the report said calling on governments to develop specifically targeted prevention strategies. 	Those at highest risk include gay men and other men who have sex with men, transgender people, injecting drug users, and people who buy and sell sex. 	In India, HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men is 3.5 per cent for those younger than 25 years while it is 4.9 per cent for men older than 25. 	HIV prevalence among sex workers under 25 years of age in India was 1.7 per cent for the 2007-2014 period. "

On the one hand, the prevalence of HIV among various vulnerable groups has been coming down in the state. On the other, there seems to be a reduction in the central government funds to NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) for AIDS control programmes and IEC activities (information, education and communication) undertaken through the various SACS (State AIDS Control Society). According to officials of the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS), in 2014-15, 32,190 new HIV cases were identified in the state with Guntur, East Godavari and Krishna being the most vulnerable districts mainly due to presence of high number of migrants and truckers. Between April to September 2015, 4,00,090 got tested, out of which 12,742 were confirmed as HIV positive in AP. Currently, 1,28,760 people are living with HIV and are under medication in AP, among which 11,566 are from Vizag district. ""In accordance with the theme of 'Getting to Zero- Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Stigma and Discrimination, Zero AIDS Related Deaths', the overall incidence of HIV/AIDS is coming down in the state but we still don't have a comparative statistics yet as the entire data of the combined state is with Telangana and we are trying to get the AP data post bifurcation. Even then, if we compare the overall prevalence among the high risk groups at present with those three-four years ago, we find that in almost all cases, the prevalence rate has come down,"" stated additional project director (APD) of APSACS Rajendra Prasad. ""In ante-natal women, the prevalence rate is 0.1% now as compared to more than 1.5% three-four years earlier. Similarly, in female sex workers, it has come down from 8% to 4% and in MSMs (men who have sex with men) it's 8% as compared to 10% three years ago. Only in case of Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the cases have gone up from 8% to 10%. We are trying to implement employer-need models in industries to generate awareness among workers too. We also feel the need for generation of continuous awareness and more IEC activities, which has slowed down,"" Prasad said. Speaking on IEC and other issues, an official from Naco working with State Aids Control Society, requesting anonymity, said, ""There's some problem regarding availability of funds to fight AIDS. The combined state of AP-Telangana got Rs 115 crore in 2014. But this year, only Rs 94 crore has been given by the Centre. In fact, the central government has asked the respective state governments to contribute 20 per cent of the funds. Given the fund crunch in the two states, such a move may hamper AIDS control programmes. Even IEC activities need to be continued without gaps because today's children would be tomorrow's youth and therefore a sustainable approach is needed to curtail incidence of HIV. Any neglect at this juncture would escalate the incidences. Since the last one year, the supply of condoms and drugs are also erratic."" Additional district medical and health officer of Vizag (ADMHO - AIDS and Leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said that there had been some fund issues after bifurcation and the budget has not been finalised yet. Meanwhile, on the occasion of World AIDS Day, a rally has been organised by the district administration and medical and health department from GVMC Gandhi Statue to AU Assembly Hall. HIV expert Padmashree Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao will also release a unique calendar on POSITIVE SIGN In 2014-15, 32,190 new HIV cases were identified with Guntur, East Godavari and Krishna being the most vulnerable districts Between April to September 2015, 4,00,090 got tested out of which 12,742 confirmed as HIV positive in AP Currently, 1,28,760 people are living with HIV and on ART drugs in AP among which 11,566 are from Vizag district *Data from APSACS "

As a part of the campaign, the resident doctors throughout the state would also give sex-cum-reproductive education for youths in the age group of 15 and 25 and clear myths about HIV. MARD president Sagar Mundada said, ""Among the plans chalked out during the awareness campaign, we will be clearing myths about spread of HIV and clearing the facts that HIV can be contacted through only three ways - sexual intercourse, mother to child transmission and incorrect blood transfusions."" Doctors will also click selfies with patients of HIV to communicate the message that the disease does not spread by touching or hugging. Medicos, too, will be educated regarding recent changes in HIV treatment protocols by WHO as many still are not aware about it, he added. ""The programme also includes creating awareness throughout this week that it is not HIV per se but secondary infections which causes death. So if patients take medication regularly, their immunity will be good and infections can be delayed. We will also sensitize people that those who claim to have the cure for AIDS are just quacks and that they should not fall prey to such false promises,"" said MARD secretary Ayudh Magdum. The campaign would encourage youth to go for HIV test before marriage with slogan 'Test karo, kundali bhul jao'. ""We will encourage young couples to test for HIV rather than matching kundalis and resident doctors and MARD members will take pledge that they will lead the way by testing themselves before marriage,"" said Mundada. Meanwhile, all resident doctors will sport the AIDs red ribbon for 7 days throughout the state. ""Display boards with messages - Testing first, Kundali comes secondary, this small step can help avoid disastrous consequences and it should be a thing everybody feels comfortable with rather than feeling embarrassed. Around 100 boards will be displayed in each medical college throughout this week encouraging people to take a pledge that they will get themselves tested for HIV before marriage. Also, all those who decide to do the same will be given a certificate of appreciation from MARD and also will be given medical help by the MARD member who will supervise his treatment,"" he said. "
139,12,2015,New test to detect HIV faster,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/New-test-to-detect-HIV-faster/articleshow/48156116.cms,"Maharashtra will soon introduce a new test for HIV in order to reduce transfusion transmitted infections.Called the nucleic acid test (NAT), it is a test that detects HIV within four days of the infection being contracted. The present method to screen HIV has a four-week window period (the time between a person is infected and the virus infection starts showing up in the tests). The decision to introduce NAT came about when health minister Deepak Sawant was reviewing HIV AIDS cases in the state in a meeting with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). The minister was informed that of the 11 lakh donor blood samples tested across the state, more than 2,500 were found to be HIV+. This means that these HIV+ had donated blood during the window period (and probably did not know that they were infected). The minister was also told that NAT test ing is very important to reduce the risk of HIV infection though blood transfusion. To put things in perspective, at least 1,000 people in Maharashtra contracted HIV in the past five years due to blood transfusions. ""It was in January this year that the NAT proposal was discussed with the health minister and he finally pushed the proposal to the Centre,"" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS. Presently all blood banks follow the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) guidelines and use fourth generation HIV Elisa testing kits to screen blood for HIV. According to Pardesi, NACO has sanctioned Rs 18 crore for the NAT test. Six districts -Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Nagpur and Ahmedanagar -will have NAT centers and around 300 blood banks will be attached to the centers. Blood samples from all over the state will be sent to one of these centers for testing. Currently, only two private hospitals in the city - Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital (Andheri) and PD Hinduja hospital (Mahim) have NAT equipment. While a single ELISA test cost Rs 200, NAT costs Rs 1,000 per test. ""The cost of installing NAT equipment is high. Therefore, it took time to install the facility in state. We will also provide training to the lab technician for the NAT testing,"" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS. Karnataka was the first state in the country to implement the NAT system in all government blood banks.For more stories, follow us on Twitter and Facebook"
140,12,2015,Major signs and early symptoms of HIV infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Major-signs-and-early-symptoms-of-HIV-infection/articleshow/26950399.cms,"HIV (human immunodeficiency infection) is an infection that attacks our body's immune system, the body's natural protection framework. Without a solid safe framework, the body experiences difficulty fending off malady. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. HIV is a virus spread through certain body fluids that attacks the body’s natural immune system. The damage to the immune system makes it harder and harder for the body to fight off infections and some other diseases. Here are a few signs and symptoms of HIV which you should look out for.HIV Sign and Symptom 1 : FeverOne symptom that comes in the very beginning is fever known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS). Fever is ordinarily accompanied with symptoms like tiredness and body torment.HIV Sign and Symptom 2 : FatigueAt the point when the infection enters the blood, the vulnerable immune system is hit. Likewise, aggravation because of poor immunity causes exhaustion and fatigue.HIV Sign and Symptom 3 : Skin rashRash is the most common symptom of HIV. For a person with HIV, the skin can become extremely sensitive to irritants and sunlight. This effect can show up at the beginning or at a later stage. On the off chance that the skin rash isn't effortlessly treated then it could be because of the HIV infection.HIV Sign and Symptom 4 : Weight lossThe people suffering from HIV or those who have just fallen sick with HIV generally lose weight rapidly due to the above symptoms.HIV Sign and Symptom 5 : Dry cough and pneumoniaDry cough should be immediately treated with common treatments. If it is done so, this persistent coughing can lead to pneumonia, which is a sign of the HIV virus.HIV Sign and Symptom 6 : Nausea and vomitingThese squeamish inclinations which are not effectively treated could suggest HIV contamination.HIV Sign and Symptom 7 : Joint and muscle painLymph nodes shape some portion of the resistant framework which is our immune system. When the immune system is tainted by HIV virus, the lymph nodes get inflamed giving a sign of HIV disease.HIV Sign and Symptom 8 : Night SweatsHIV infected individuals also experience night sweats. This symptom is very similar to women entering menopause.There are a few ways which may help you beat the HIV virus. Here we have mentioned those natural ways that you can add into your daily life and habits to stay safe from the HIV virus.Tip # 1 – Fast for at least 1 day a week. Drink only the concoction made of distilled water, lemon juice and honey.Tip # 2 - Eat predigested proteins for maximum digestion. Products like soy milk contain soy protein and yogurt culture, and are great for health as well.Tip # 3 - Eat cultured proteins like yogurt made from soy milk, that is easily absorbed and digested, and contains acidophilus. This friendly flora produces lactic acid which destroys the bad bacteria.Tip # 4 - Take protein digestive enzymes if you eat hard to digest proteins like meat, eggs, fish or fowl.Tip # 5 - Eliminate those proteins from the diet that are hard to digest, like casein from dairy products and gluten’s from wheat and, coagulated proteins from like in fried meats."

These patients are being categorized under Lost to Follow Up (LFU) category and with an objective to trace their current locations, teams of counselors and care support system have been assigned the task to locate and counsel them after finding the reason for skipping drugs. Ironically, all the 107 patients were enlisted on ART (Anti-retroviral therapy) center at SRN hospital. “A patient who does not visit the concerned ART center or skips drugs for more than 90 days, he or she is being categorized under Lost to Follow Up category,” said Dr Rohit Pandey, district programme manager of Dapcu (District Aids Prevention &amp; Control Unit), adding, “We have been making sincere efforts to trace all the LFU category patients and further counsel them for treatment.” However, he claimed that there were above 400 patients under Lost to Follow Up category earlier but sincere efforts and hard work of counselors had brought the strength down to 107. The officials are also making efforts to contact neighbouring or other state ART centers if any LFU patient approached them. “As the DAPCU has complete details of patients undergoing ART at both block- and urban-pockets level, we have been making constant efforts to trace the LFU patients,” claimed Dr Pandey, adding “there were cases when patients candidly refused to take up treatment and we had to work hard to convince and counsel them,” he said. Officials claim counselling plays a vital role in convincing a patient for ART. Counselors and care support officials interact with them on frequent intervals to check the myths regarding the treatment. Secondly, awareness is the key to check the spread of the disease and both urban and rural populace are aware of the causes of aids\hiv. Officials admit that street and folk plays have played a vital role in checking myths among rural belt of Allahabad. This fiscal year, a total of 4786 persons were registered for pre –ART and 1,852 of them were enrolled for ART."

The court rejected clean chit to all concerned authorities given by the probe agency. The court granted 60-day time to the central agency to complete further probe on specific issues and submit the report. Expressing dissatisfaction over CBI's closure report by terming it 'incomplete', the court said that it was necessary to get the issue probed further. The court said that the Gujarat high court had transferred the probe to CBI to get this subject investigated in minute detail. ""It is necessary to probe the issue further. It could lead to the root of the matter and clarify on who are the responsible persons,"" the court said. Last year, CBI had filed a closure report by giving clean chit to Mahendra Mashroo, local BJP MLA, who runs Sarvodaya Blood Bank from where the blood was sourced by the government hospital, for transfusion into the thalassaemic children. Blood transfusion also took place there. However, it was later revealed that the thalassaemic children were HIV positive and several of them had passed away since 2011. Parents of 34 such thalassaemic kids fought a long legal battle and finally sought further probe after CBI filed a closure report claiming that there could be various reasons behind the thalassaemic kids contracting HIV. The court agreed with arguments put forth by their counsel Paresh Waghela in case of three girls, who got treatment only at Junagadh civil hospital and obtained blood from Sarvodaya Blood Bank.ed on how they keep tested blood units with those bottles that are not tested.

They also staged a street play through which message of unsafe sex was given. 	In the morning, a programme was held by Indian Medical Association (IMA) to create awareness among paramedical and nursing staff about AIDS.

This has enabled HIV patients to avail social benefits offered by the Centre as well as the state government on a single platform. 	DAPCU officials are focusing on blocks like Pratappur, Soraon, Shankargarh, Koraon, Meja and Phulpur which are home to migrants - a large chunk of them being vulnerable to HIV infection. 	DAPCU nodal officer and district tuberculosis officer Dr OP Shahi said they are doing health check-up of migrants besides offering counseling and treatment to HIV affected. He added that migrant labourers, truck drivers and MSM (men having sex with men) have been given free condoms for safe sex. These migrants are mainly responsible for spread of HIV infection in the district. A survey has shown that migrants working at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who keep moving from one state to another in search of work) are responsible for the spread of the deadly disease. 	Officials have also identified high-risk groups like sex workers and intravenous drug users who would be covered under the programme to restrict the spread of the virus. "

Number of new HIV infections have shown a decline of 15-20% in the last five years. The reason, believe experts, is primarily the control mechanism put in place by the local AIDS control authority. However, Surat has a long way to go as it still tops the state with the highest number of HIV infected individuals. In Gujarat, there are 48,917 people suffering from HIV/AIDS of which 26,955 are male and 18,687 female. There are 2,975 children below the age of 15 years who are living with HIV/AIDS. In Surat alone, there are 9,998 people who are HIV positive (5,734 male and 3,785 female) with 479 children according to Gujarat State Network of People (GSNP) living with HIV/AIDS and state government. Dr Mukul Choksi, a psychiatrist who treats number of patients attributes the decline to fear factor and training of sex workers by NGOs and government. ""On one hand, we have fear among people be it educated or uneducated class. This has led to adoption of safe sex practices to larger extent. On the other hand, large number of sex workers have been trained to practice safe sex and it is being practised widely."" A senior medical officer of Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre in Surat said that improved services at ART centres and increased awareness has also led to fall in new infections. ""Once an infected patient is introduced to ART drugs, viral load of HIV goes down in his body and transmission risks decreases. This coupled with number of awareness campaigns and safe sex practices has started giving positive results and we hope it will serve its purpose in another 10 years,"" said Dr Alap Mehta, senior medical officer of Surat ART center. Daxa Patel, of GSNP said, ""It is good that new infections have come down, but we only hope that social taboos and social indignation that many AIDS/HIV patients face also comes down."" Surat has maximum number of HIV positive patients due to its large migratory male labour population."

The holy city, which until last year was ranked fifth among top five cities in the state that had highest number of HIV infected population, now ranks fourth in 2015, indicating silent spread of virus. Though health department is increasing medical and diagnostic services in Ujjain, considering Simhastha 2016 fair, a concrete policy to curb the deadly virus spread in large floating population is yet to be chalked out. Deputy director, Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (MPSACS), Prashant Mallaiya, said, “As Simhastha is a religious fair, we will have a plan in place, considering the huge large influx of people during the period. We will also take guidance from the Centre about the measures that can be initiated in the coming months.” 	As per MPSACS figures, out of total 1,39,106 patients screened for HIV, 2,361 were confirmed positive between January 2000 and October 2014. However, as per the screening survey till October 2015, out of 1,81,978 patients that underwent screening, 2,544 were confirmed positive. Ujjain replaced Gwalior in terms of number of HIV positive patients this year. Nodal officer for TB/HIV in Ujjain, Dr ML Malviya said, “Every year we are trying to screen more number of people for HIV. We are also carrying out awareness activities with the help of NGOs to sensitize people about the consequences of the deadly disease and precautions against it. As Simhastha is scheduled next year, MPSACS must be preparing its action plan.” 	After Indore, Dhar and Ujjain are two districts along the NH3, which have a significant number of registered HIV positive cases. Being a pilgrim centre, Ujjain witnesses flow of visitors all the year round. Besides, there are truck drivers too. It results in a huge floating population. According to ART Centre incharge, MY Hospital, Dr VP Pandey, “If we look at the map of MP, we find prevalence more in developed and industrial areas. High-risk activity is more because of migrant workforce.” "

Sanjay (name changed), a 35-year-old resident of Bahanaga area in the coastal Balasore district, has been on a mission for the last couple of years to spread awareness about various aspects of AIDS and the HIV virus. He has, in fact, become an icon for hundreds of AIDS affected people in the region. Apart from looking out for HIV positive people and helping them as and when required, he has been attending awareness workshops and campaigns in the districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara. While on the occasion of World AIDS Day on December 1, government and private organizations were busy holding closed door meetings and seminars at upmarket hotels in the cities, Sanjay, who is attached to a non-government organization, was spreading awareness in remote villages. ""I have met more than 500 HIV patients during such programmes and interacted with them. I feel it is an opportunity for me to make people aware about the dos and don'ts of the disease. Even though I am an HIV patient, I have never felt ashamed. My aim is to make our society HIV free,"" he said. As there is social stigma attached to the disease, HIV positive people face censure and humiliation from villagers and even family members in remote villages. Through his mission, Sanjay has been trying to make them familiar with the life and problems faced by an AIDS or HIV-affected person. He visits hospitals, collects data about HIV positive people and meets them personally to enquire whether they are facing any problems. Life was good for Sanjay till he completed Plus II and left for Mumbai in 1998 to work in a private company. He unknowingly came in contact with an HIV positive person from whom he is believed to have been affected with the disease. He had to return home in 2011 after he was diagnosed to be HIV positive. ""I felt like the sky broke down on me. However, I tried to get over the trauma and got myself treated. My family supported me a lot to overcome the stress and stigma attached to the disease. Later, I came in contact with volunteers who taught me how to have the patience to lead life,"" he said. In awareness meetings, he appeals to people not to worry or feel ashamed of being HIV positive or suffering from AIDS. ""Just lead a normal life and live happily till the end of your days,"" he advises them, besides letting them know about various social security schemes launched by the government for HIV patients. "

The centre was proven wrong after the Rims based Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) laboratory which is under the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) tested the patient HIV positive. The glitch prompted Rims management to launch a probe into the episode. ""The incident has been reported. We have sought an explanation from the general manager of the laboratory,"" Rims deputy medical superintendent Dr Kumari Vasundhara said on Thursday evening. Vasundhara said such misleading reports will not be tolerated by the the Rims management.

The ICTC report, which came in late on Wednesday evening, confirmed the patient HIV positive,"" the source said on Thursday. This is the second case at Rims when a HIV patient was heckled at the hospital after a patient was denied admission at the hospital last week. Rims director Dr BL Sherwal had ordered a probe into the incident. Meanwhile, the state health department on Thursday sought suggestions on the upcoming state budget of 2015-16 from its employees. In a meeting chaired by health secretary K Vidyasagar, health department officials were asked to submit their suggestions in terms of new projects based on ground experiences.

She was later sent back to India with a ‘contagious disease’ tag on her visa. Daisy has been swimming against the flow since then, working with many NGOs in Tamil Nadu. TOI is naming Daisy since she wanted to be identified. 	When the recent flood wreaked havoc with the lives of many in the city, Daisy got an opportunity to return to her old job which she had to quit after testing HIV positive. She tested blood samples of flood-affected people in the medical camps organised by an NGO in many parts of the city. 	Back in 1997, after the blood bank of the hospital where Daisy worked ran out of stock during an emergency operation, the staff was requested to donate blood. The donors were tested and Daisy’s blood turned out to be HIV positive. “I was clueless about how I got infected until I saw my husband’s medical report at our home in Vellore. He was sick. And one day he told me that he was HIV positive. It was the most shocking moment in my life,” she said. 	Worse, Daisy’s husband even spoiled her plan to return to Oman in many ways. He threatened her and tore her passport. But Daisy managed to go back to Oman with a new passport. Her husband reacted furiously by writing to the management of the hospital where she worked. The management asked her to undergo one more test, and unfortunately that too turned out to be positive. 	As she was getting ready for her return, she got a telegram. “It said my husband was no more, but it was too late. I had to leave the place with a ‘contagious disease’ tag on my visa. I was made to sit inside the aircraft with three rows in front of and behind me kept vacant,” Daisy said. 	Back home, life has finally taken a positive turn for Daisy. “HIV is a gift from God. I take it positively. I am happy that I could save people during this natural calamity,” she said. "
152,12,2015,"‘In UP, 80% of people with HIV are untreated’",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/In-UP-80-of-people-with-HIV-are-untreated/articleshow/50194262.cms,"LUCKNOW: More than 80% of the people living with HIV in the state are yet to get treatment. Of the estimated 1.25 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Uttar Pradesh, only 25,278 are getting free anti-retroviral therapy (ART) treatment, according to data from the UP State AIDS Control Society. The fact came to the fore at a seminar, ‘30 years of HIV in India’, organised by the department of microbiology of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, AIDS Society of India, People’s Health Organisation and Citizen News Service, on Monday. “The situation is scary and the government must do everything possible to test and treat the untapped patients,” said Dr Ishwar Gilada, president AIDS Society of India and one of the first physicians in the country to have worked on the issue. “UPSACS data shows that 77,125 patients had registered with them at some point of time. I wonder how and why the track of those patients was lost,” he told reporters. Nodal officer at the ART centre at King George’s Medical University, Dr D Himanshu, said stigma and discrimination related to HIV and AIDS were prevalent in the state and a number of initiatives needed to be taken to counter myths related to the disease. Head of the microbiology department at SGPGIS Dr Tapan Dhole stressed on the need for providing effective treatment for co-morbidities related to HIV. “TB is just one of the many problems PLHIV face,” he said.

The patient, a 50-year-old man who had arrived from Giridih district on Thursday morning with a urine retention problem, died in the casualty ward of Rims within an hour as the hospital allegedly did not admit the patient. 	The kin of the patient alleged that despite being referred an emergency surgery, the hospital management did not admit him. However, the Rims management claimed he was admitted and died before being taken to the surgery unit. 	“The patient came in at 11.45am with urine retention problem. The doctor on duty in the casualty ward then referred him to the surgery unit for an emergency operation, but he died,” Rims director Dr B L Sherwal said on Thursday evening. “He was certainly admitted, but there could have been a slack in medical attention,” Sherwal added. 	The Rims management has ordered an enquiry and constituted a three-member probe committee, comprising one professor each from the medicine and surgery departments and one medical officer and directed the submission of the report in three days. 	This is the third alleged case of negligence towards HIV patients in this month. While an HIV positive patient was handed a wrong report from a private diagnostic centre early this week, another positive patient was denied admission earlier this month. 	“The consecutive reports have come as a cause of deep concern for us. We are not going to tolerate such negligence in the future,” Sherwal added. "
154,12,2015,"Cancer, HIV drugs get cheaper",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/Cancer-HIV-drugs-get-cheaper/articleshow/50331323.cms,"Govt Adds 36 Medicines To Essential List For bringing down prices of medicines for critical diseases like cancer, HIV and diabetes, the government has revised the national list of essential medicines (NLEM) to add 106 more drugs while 70 other drugs, which are not prescribed frequently or where better alternatives are now available in the market, have been taken off the list. This means, the total number of essential medicines, prices of which are capped by the central government, would increase from 348 to 384, including diagnostic agents and contraceptives. The move following recommendations from a core committee formed by the health ministry is expected to make many important drugs affordable or at least reduce their prices significantly to bring relief to patients. Calling it the “best fit list”, the core committee under the chairmanship of former Indian Council of Medical Research chief VM Katoch said emphasis was laid on the disease-burden and treatment guidelines as basis for selecting, and therefore, medicines which are “aligned with the current treatment guide lines“ and those used for treatment of diseases that are “public health problems“ have been added to the new list. The new list of essential medicines, which comes into effect immediately, will be revised every three years as per the committee’s recommendations. The committee also suggested that given the diversity in climate, food habits and culture in India, the government should also consider inclusion of medicines for priority healthcare conditions for different regions. For instance, kala azar is more prevalent in Bihar whereas Japanese encephalitis is more prevalent in Assam. However, the recommendations did not delve into details of how this has to be done. The existing Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO), 2013 which guides prices of medicines in the country was implemented in May 2013 after the NLEM, 2011 was finalized following stringent Supreme Court directives asking government to make essential medicines affordable. However, immediately after its implementation, the drug price regulator National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority as well as health groups raised concerns about many important medicines remaining outside the purview of price control. Taking cognizance of the matter, the health ministry had constituted the panel to evaluate NLEM periodically in order to keep prices under check. "
