0,1,2011,Can't deny job to HIV-positive: HC,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Cant-deny-job-to-HIV-positive-HC/articleshow/7220200.cms," CHENNAI: Can a public authority deny employment to a candidate who is HIV-positive? ‘No’ is the emphatic answer of the Madras high court. Justice K Chandru, flaying two state transport corporation (STC) managements for their ""pedestrian understanding of AIDS and HIV"" leading to denial of employment to two driver-aspirants who tested positive during the medical test, said: ""The action of the state-owned transport corporations in driving the candidates to test for HIV itself was totally repugnant to the national policy. Their further attempt to deny employment to them is again not only unwarranted but also contrary to the dictum laid down by various courts and the policy of the Union of India."" The matter relates to two candidates — identified merely as ‘Mr X’ and ‘Mr Y’ — who were sponsored by the employment exchange for driver posts. While Mr Y had passed plus two, Mr X had served in the Army for eight years.In October 2009 and November 2009, they were considered for appointment and sent to panel doctors for the medical fitness certificate. After their blood samples tested HIV positive, the doctors said they were ‘unfit’ for appointment as drivers. Interestingly, the blood test was not conducted in any specialised laboratory; neither was it done with the consent of the candidates. Also, no prior information or pre-test and post-test counselling was provided by the laboratory. Without heeding to requests, the doctors forwarded the ‘report’ to the transport corporations with findings that they were unfit for employment. Responding to the writ petition, the managements contended that the candidates were HIV-positive and hence not of sound health. There was no fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution for being selected as driver, it was further submitted. Justice Chandru, expressing shock at the ""layman apprehension"" of the authorities, dubbed the incident unfortunate. He said the issue had already been answered by court decisions all over the world, including the Supreme Court of India. Quoting extensively from judgments in the US and South Africa and other courts in India, Justice Chandru pointed out that the guiding principles of India’s national policy on HIV/AIDS was non-discrimination. Noting that a test for CD4 count dropping below 350 cells per microlitre of blood alone could be the scientific basis for turning down candidates, he said, ""This is the standard test adopted by the Indian Army."" Every HIV-positive case could not be denied employment, he said. The judge then directed the managements to employ both the driver-aspirants within a period of eight weeks as there was no other disqualification against them. "
1,1,2011,TN first state to develop HIV stigma index,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/TN-first-state-to-develop-HIV-stigma-index/articleshow/7256484.cms," CHENNAI: Sreelatha S (42) was good at her work. But she was asked to quit after people at her workplace learnt about her HIV-positive status six months ago. ""Suddenly people started feeling uncomfortable around me. I was asked to quit,"" she says. Experiences of people like Sreelatha will go into the making of a stigma index' which Tamil Nadu hopes to use for fighting discrimination. The state, which has 1.5 lakh people living with HIV, will be the first in the country to have such an index. HIV positive people will interview victims of stigma so that they open up and discuss their experiences. The accounts of thousands of such people would go into developing the index which will eventually reflect the levels and spread of discrimination. ""The research outcome would help the government and communities strategise programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination,"" said Vishwanath Koliwad, secretary veneral of the Family Planning Association of India, the implementing agency. The project launched on Friday is funded by the Department for International Development. The family planning body and some other designated organisations would set up a Project Advisory Committee to set goals and review the progress of the project. The index was launched in the Dominican Republic in 2008 and followed up by twelve other countries the next year. It documents and compares different experiences of people living with HIV in different countries, measures changes over a period of time, and creates an evidence base and possible solutions. ""It aims to address key barriers to HIV treatment, prevention, care and support. We also hope to collect information and experiences of people living with HIV-related discrimination and human rights,"" said project coordinator Anandi Yuvaraj The index would also help people suffering from HIV/AIDS to know more about their rights and improve their situation. ""We have found that stigma is increasing in areas where intervention is less,"" said AIDS Prevention and Control project director Dr Bimal Charles. A pilot survey done among 64 people in five countries found that 64% of them suffered harassment or assault and most of the cases were as a result of their HIV status. About 35% reported losing their jobs because of their HIV status. "
2,1,2011,New drug regime leaves HIV people dizzy,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/New-drug-regime-leaves-HIV-people-dizzy/articleshow/7256503.cms," TIRUCHI: Several people living with HIV/ AIDS in the state have complained of problems including hallucination and dizziness after the state government changed one of the drugs prescribed to them, non-governmental organisations have said. Doctors said the substitute drug was more effective and problems, if any, would only be temporary. Anti-retrovirals, the drugs of choice for people with HIV/ AIDS, are distributed free of cost at several government hospitals across the state. Usually anti-retroviral therapy comprises the drugs zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. Last month, doctors replaced nevirapine with a drug called efavirenz. Senior district officials said the drug was substituted following a letter from the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. G Karunanidhi, president of HIV Positive Network, said members of his organisation complained of problems after being administered the new drug combination. ""Efavirenz is normally given to people with tuberculosis. In others, it could cause insomnia and tuberculosis resistance. Th government has distributed the drugs to clear stocks,"" said Karunanidhi. Tamil Nadu Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS secretary D Nandha Kumar said they were being needlessly given higher doses of anti-virals. Experts say efavirenz is more expensive and more effective, but need not be given to every patient. ""Efavirenz functions like nevrapine, but it works better,"" says Dr Sunithi Solomon, who heads YRG Care, an NGO working with HIV positive people. ""But if the patient is doing well with nevrapine, there is no reason to change the prescription. The patient may feel dizzy, but soon feel better,"" she said. Social workers are worried that HIV patients complaining of problems with the new drug might drop out of the therapy. ""Patients should have been warned about possible side-effects,"" said a social worker from an NGO in Tiruchi. Doctors said side effects would be temporary. ""Blood tests have found an improvement in the condition of people who were given efavirenz. We will counsel the patients about this,"" said a senior government doctor. "
3,1,2011,'Make HIV test a must before marriage',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/Make-HIV-test-a-must-before-marriage/articleshow/7256727.cms," THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kerala Women's Commission has urged the state government to make HIV tests mandatory for wannabe couples. The panel says it finds alarming the predicament of women who become AIDS victims because of their husbands and such a test would act as an effective preventive measure. ""Many women, mostly poor, come to us complaining that they've been infected by their partners. After hearing their difficulties, we decided to conduct a study to go into the problem,"" Justice D Sreedevi, commission chairperson said. The study revealed that the number of men getting married keeping their infection a secret has only increased. Women who get infected have to go through an ordeal and at least 70% of them are sacked by their employers. Most of these women earn Rs 1,000 or less. ""Given these problems, we felt the best possible solution would be to make HIV test mandatory before marriage. The government should make a law to ensure this,"" Justice Sreedevi said. "

Staff at the Amman College of Arts and Science asked P Manikandan, 22, a second-year student of BSc computer science, to vacate his room as he fell ill often. The Dindigul administration, instead of advising the college to accommodate the youth in the hostel, has agreed to take care of his accommodation expenses outside. Collector M Vallalar told TOI that activists brought the issue to him and he had made enquiries. ""The college administration told me that the student was frequently ill with fever and diarrhoea and as the boys were staying in a dormitory, others were also affected."" So, the college decided to ask Manikandan to live outside the campus. "

7,1,2011,"Living with HIV, running against stigma",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Living-with-HIV-running-against-stigma/articleshow/7288405.cms," MUMBAI: Sandeep Sonawane was only 13 when he learnt that he was HIV-positive. Now, nine years later, Sandeep is all set to put his 'disease' behind and his best foot forward when he participates in the Sunday's marathon along with seven other HIV-positive persons. The group aims to educate the society about HIV and hopes that its efforts will go a long way in battling the stigma and discrimination that come attached with the dreaded virus. Sandeep, who is the president of an NGO, People living with HIV, said that he comes across several cases of discrimination against HIV-positive people. ""There have been cases where the families of HIV-positive persons refused to perform their last rites. In such cases, we arranged for the funeral. No matter how modern our society becomes, their perception of HIV positive people doesn't change too much,"" said the Kalyan resident. Autorickshaw driver Akbar Khan (36), who was detected with HIV in 2002, has been having health problems for some time now. ""Not all healthcare centres are helpful to the HIV-positive. At times, I had to run around from hospital to hospital. Private hospitals would ask for a deposit, which I didn't have at the time,"" said the resident of Jarimari slum in Kurla. Then Khan heard about an insurance policy for HIV-positive patients. ""I took out the policy last year. I recently had a heart problem and was admitted to a private hospital. The policy really helped me. I felt like I was human too, just like other patients,"" said Khan, who is going to run in the marathon with Population Services International (PSI), the NGO that brought out the insurance policy for HIV-positive people. ""We want to tell the society that HIV-positive people can lead as normal a life as anyone else. They are physically fit, work and lead a normal life and should thus be treated as normally as others,"" said Ravi Subbiah, director of PSI Connect. Mohan, another HIV-positive, said, ""I want people to show support for those living with HIV. I hope to infuse strength in them."" ""I am really excited about the marathon. This is the first time I will participate in such an event. In fact, we have arranged similar t-shirts for the event. The event is a good platform to help change the society's opinion on HIV and AIDS. I am proud to be part of this,"" said Khan. Sandeep said, ""Not everybody suffering from HIV is brave enough to come forward and speak about the virus and the disease. But with some encouragement from us as well as support from the society, people living with HIV have a chance of improving the situation around them."" "

K Radhakrishnan (41), his wife R Kanchana (36), their two daughters and two nieces escaped, some of them with minor injuries. Radhakrishnan said in his complaint that Thirumani panchayat president V Rajagopal, who wanted the family to vacate the village because of the couple’s HIV positive status, was behind the incident. Police have registered a case of attempt to murder, but have not arrested anyone. ""What wrong did we do?"" wailed Kanchana, when TOI visited the couple on Sunday. ""We were thrown out of our rented houses in Chengalpet many times after the owners came to know that we were HIV positive."" Radhakrishnan said the group locked the house from outside and set fire to it at 2.30 am on Thursday because he refused to listen to the village leaders’ diktat that they go away from the village. Radhakrishnan and his wife R Kanchana work as coordinators for the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. They were fast asleep, along with four children when they realised the house was on fire. Radhakrishnan sustained injuries on his forehead and arms and his two-year-old daughter R Jemimu suffered bruises on her abdomen while trying to get out of the house on fire. The injured were taken to the Chengalpet Medical College Hospital and discharged in a day. The couple now live with a relative in Chengalpet without police protection. Radhakrishnan said he woke up early in the morning and saw flames engulfing the thatched roof. He tried to open the door, but it was latched from outside. When the couple cried for help, some neighbours came to their rescue. ""The stigma should end. Most families have a person with some aliment. It is not proper to isolate HIV positive people just because they have infection,"" said S Nandakumar, a neighbour who helped put out the fire. Not many in the village echo Nandakumar’s sentiments. Panchayat president V Rajagopal, who has been named in the FIR as a suspect, is among those opposed to the family living in the village. When approached by TOI, Rajagopal denied that any such incident happened in the village. ""To my knowledge, no house was burnt,"" said Rajagopal. "

10,1,2011,Red Ribbon buses to spread HIV awareness in backward districts,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Red-Ribbon-buses-to-spread-HIV-awareness-in-backward-districts/articleshow/7313589.cms," NEW DELHI: Remember the Red Ribbon Express — the eight-coach train that covered 25,000 km spreading awareness about HIV. India is now working on rolling out Red Ribbon buses that would reach out to the most backward villagers — targets that the chugging train missed out while passing through 22 states and 152 districts in one year. Speaking exclusively to ToI, Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said though the train was first introduced in India in 2007, it was primarily used for creating awareness against HIV. In 2010, the ministry decided to use the train to test people for HIV. Doctors, posted on the train and at stations, counselled the patients. ""The train reached out to eight million people, trained 81,000 and tested 36,000 for HIV. I have asked National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) to identify specific high prevalence districts, where we will send Red Ribbon buses to provide treatment, counselling and talk about safe sex. The buses will have testing and treatment facilities on board,"" Azad said. Naco is close to identifying around 35 high prevalence districts in six states — West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — where the Red Ribbon buses will be rolled out by April. A bus, a testing and treatment mobile unit with two doctors and four counsellors will be dedicated for three districts. ""Those being targetted are from backward districts, which the train couldn't reach. Our idea is to contain the virus in small pockets and not let it spread,"" the minister added. The targetted districts are known to be hotspots for migrants to urban areas. ""The buses and medical unit will teach migrants about safe sex habits and precautions. They will also be encouraged to get tested for HIV before leaving the village and after returning from the city,"" a Naco official said. Around 1.2 lakh Indians got infected with HIV in 2010, even though the incidence rate of new cases fell in the country by over 50% in the last decade. India, which has 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria. However, the country's HIV prevalence is still low at 0.31% from 0.36% in 2006. Migrants are believed to be fuelling India's HIV epidemic. This has led Naco to identify 68 main railway stations in districts across 11 states from where migrants usually board long-distance trains for urban areas. Studies on the relation between migration and HIV conducted recently by Naco in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. The highest burden of HIV was found to be among migrants, after the high-risk groups like sex workers and men who have sex with men. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. "
11,1,2011,Nearly half of HIV-positive women in TN unaware of contraceptives: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Nearly-half-of-HIV-positive-women-in-TN-unaware-of-contraceptives-Study/articleshow/7322637.cms," CHENNAI: In a survey conducted among 986 HIV-positive women in 13 high-prevalence districts across Tamil Nadu, it was found that a shocking 48% of them had no knowledge about contraceptives. The survey, which analysed the reporductive, child and sexual health needs of women living with HIV/AIDS in the state, also showed that over 60% of them had never heard of cervical cancer and pap smear tests even though HIV-positive women are more susceptible to cervical and breast cancer. As many as 70% of the women surveyed were daily wage laboureres and belonged to the lower economic class with a monthly income of less than Rs 5,000 a month. More than half the women were not aware of the various sexually transmitted infections (STI) and only 3% of the women could guess that an STI was a problem related to the genitals. The survey also revealed that most HIV-positive women (60.4%) did not share information on STIs with their adolescent children and had inhibitions about discussing about sex and sexuality with their children. The results of the survey were released during a four-day leadership training programme for HIV positive women from 10 states organised by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) along with the Positive Women Network (PWN). The programme hopes to address the various issues faced by HIV positive women across the country such as those related to property, violence, livelihood and sexual health. As many as 27 women from various states participated in the event and presented case studies about the various problems faced by the HIV-positive women in their respective states. The authors of 15 best case studies will be given a one-time stipend of Rs 20,000 to implement their ideas within a period of three months. ""In Tamil Nadu, one of the major issues is of women not having property rights. It is important for a HIV-positive woman to have some property to support her. If my case study is chosen, I will work towards raising awareness about this issue,"" said D Padmavathy, president of Tamil Nadu PWN. Varsha Gaekwad, president of Maharashtra PWN, said that issues of reproductive health plagued women in the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat and she hoped to address these issues and conduct awareness camps for women in the state about cervical cancer, breast cancer and other sexually transmitted diseases.

The undertrial, who was in the Sada sub-jail had died at Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC), Bambolim, on January 15, while undergoing treatment. The Goa Velha resident was brought to Sada jail in 2008. He was arrested under Sections 377 (unnatural sex) with a minor boy and 506 (2) (threatening), of the IPC and Section 8 of the Children's Act. The family members and NGOs handed over the letter from the health secretary to the North Goa collector who is also the inspector general of prisons. ""He (collector) has promised to release the body by tomorrow morning. I hope to get the body of my brother and give him a dignified funeral,"" his sister said. Earlier, family members and NGOs had met North Goa collector and demanded that the body of the HIV positive undertrial, which is lying in the morgue since January 15, be immediately released to the family. The victim's sister had alleged that they were unnecessarily being harassed and asked to go from one office to another to take the body. ""The forensic team told us as well as the SDM, who was in the GMC morgue to conduct investigations, that since my brother had died of AIDS, they wouldn't like to perform the postmortem as it would prove to risky for their lives too,"" alleged his sister. The NGOs demanded that since the family members did not suspect any foul play, the body should be released so that they can perform the last rites of the body. ""The family even gave an affidavit to the SDM stating that we have no objection to the body being released without a postmortem. However, instead of releasing the body, the SDM said that he has sent their affidavit to the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi and the family would have to wait for NHRC's reply,"" alleged activist Albertina Almeida .

The state administration had to hand over the body of John D'Souza, accused of sexually abusing minor boys, after his family met state chief secretary Sanjay Srivastava, who issued orders to this effect last night. John's family members claimed that his body was not being handed over to them as post-mortem was to be conducted on it since John, who died on January 15 while being treated at Goa Medical college and hospital, was a HIV patient.Prison authorities refused to hand over John's body to the relatives despite repetitive pleadings, they alleged. The kin, along with NGO Positive People, approached the state chief secretary and briefed him about the alleged harassment. They claimed that they had been asked to hop from one office to another under the pretext of formalities and clearances and were being harassed as John was an AIDS patient. Positive People, working for the people living with HIV, termed the attitude of state administration as 'shocking'. ""It is indeed shocking that the district authorities have not been able to release the body and have caused unnecessary pain and harassment to the grieving family who just wants to give a decent and dignified funeral to their dear one,"" the NGO's letter to the chief secretary said. D'Souza was kept in Sada sub-jail since his arrest in November 2009 for allegedly sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy in his car. The family members were asked to sign an affidavit stating that they have no suspicion on John's death before being handed over the body. "

Additional sessions judge Kamini Lau awarded the prison term to the convict, who used to work with MCD on contract , and also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on him. The court refused to allow the plea of public prosecutor, Taufiq Ahmed, seeking capital punishment for the man on the grounds that he took law into his hands over a minor dispute. While awarding the life sentence, the court took into account several mitigating factors like the convict is HIV positive and committed the crime on the spur of the moment under the influence of alcohol. Murder is punishable with life imprisonment or death penalty. ""No doubt, all murders are most degrading and depraving but the case in hand certainly does not fall within the category of rarest of rare or least even in category of rare case,"" the court said. It also noted that the victim, Rajbir, was murdered because he tried to intervene in the ongoing quarrel between his friend, Ravi Kumar, and the convict. The fact that the convict was facing charges in two pending criminal cases also went against him. The convict, who was inebriated, had hit Rajbir on his neck and face with a broken beer bottle on December 19, 2008, in Ashok Vihar here, resulting in his death. While awarding the sentence , the court directed that the fine of Rs 50,000 would be paid to the victim’s family as compensation. "

According to the data collected from Civil Hospital, 2010 saw more HIV positive cases than 2009. As many as 386 persons, including 294 men and 92 women, had tested positive for HIV in 2010, whereas 228 persons, including 188 men and 40 women, in 2009. The number of positive cases is increasing every month, as in January 2009, it was 13 and during the corresponding period in 2010, it was 20. Similarly, 16 persons had tested positive in December 2009 and 67 during the corresponding period in 2010. Sources said, People from all walks of life come on their own for blood tests. Some come after doctors ask them to. Civil Hospital senior medical officer (SMO) Ughar Singh Sooch told TOI that most of the HIV positive persons were migrants, truck drivers, farmers and drug users. We recommend every pregnant woman, tuberculosis patient and drug user should undergo HIV tests, he added. The number of HIV patients is rising every year with increase in the number of migrants in the city, he said.

In response to these challenges, the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), under the aegis of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), with the support from division of AIDS, National Institute of Health, the US and the World Health Organisation (WHO), has convened a three-day consultative meeting entitled 'Galvanizing Evidence for HIV Management' starting January 27. ""The aim of this consultation is to review current evidence on certain critical issues in HIV management and evolve simple and effective strategies that can be used in programme settings as well as in patient management,"" said Ramesh Paranjape, director, NARI. The consultative meeting is one of the many events the institute plans to organise to mark the centenary of India Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The ICMR is one of the oldest research councils in India. The council has 30 permanent institutes devoted to different areas of health. NARI is one of the ICMR institute mandated to carry out research on HIV/AIDS and related fields. V M Katoch, secretary, department of health research and director general of ICMR and Sayan Chatterjee, secretary, department of AIDS Control and director general of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) will inaugurate the meet on January 27. ""Following this, suboptimal response to first line antiretroviral therapy will be discussed. Issues related to diagnosis, treatment and prevention of tuberculosis in HIV infected will be discussed in depth to review, and if necessary, suggest modification of strategies in the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) on January 28. On January 29, HIV and Human Papiloma Virus (HPV) co-infection will be discussed,"" Paranjape said. Over 100 national and international experts, including policymakers and programme managers, scientists from various research institutes working in the area of HIV, TB and HPV, professors from relevant departments of medical colleges, infectious disease specialists and civil society members will attend the meet. ""Recommendations that will emerge out of discussions will be forwarded to the policymakers and programme managers at the national level,"" Paranjape said.eom/umesh "
18,1,2011,New method found effective in diagnosing HIV in children,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/New-method-found-effective-in-diagnosing-HIV-in-children/articleshow/7376267.cms," PUNE: Diagnosing HIV in infants and children has taken a giant leap forward. A new method, using filter paper, allows high-end polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to be performed equally effectively on small spots of dried blood rather than a whole blood sample with equal amount of sensitivity and specificity. A pilot project using this method has been successfully implemented at seven paediatric referral centres across the country by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in which a total of 9,000 samples of children, including infants, exposed to the HIV infection, were successfully screened under Early infant HIV diagnosis (EID) programme. “The PCR is a high-end test which is used to diagnose babies born to HIV-positive mothers. Traditionally, the test requires a liquid blood sample, which if taken in a rural area and transported to a testing facility, needs to be kept refrigerated. However, the dried blood spots (DBS) method is easy to prepare in a resource-limited setting and can be stored and shipped to testing facilities without refrigeration. The method has been tested successfully at the seven referral centres,” said Sayan Chatterjee, director-general of NACO, on Thursday. The PCR test using DBS method has proven to be as effective as the PCR using liquid blood samples, with good amount of sensitivity and specificity, he added. The city-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) and the B J medical college are among the seven referral centres where the samples were tested with the help of this newer diagnosis method in the last one year. “Out of the 9,000 children, 460 were found to be HIV-positive. In order to reconfirm the results, tests were also conducted on the whole blood samples to substantiate the findings,” said B B Rewari, NACO’s national programme officer. If not treated, an HIV-positive child has a 35 per cent chance of dying by his/her first birthday and a 53 per cent chance of dying before the age of two. But if the baby receives prophylactic antibiotics soon after birth and antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as it is medically indicated, he/she has a good chance of surviving childhood and living a long, healthy life. “The challenge in resource-limited settings is identifying HIV-positive infants and providing early access to this life-saving medicine,” Rewari said. The National AIDS Control Organisation has now formulated technical and operational guidelines on care of HIV-exposed infants and children below 18 months of age. The 2010 World Health Organisation guidelines recommend that all HIV-positive infants, under two years of age, begin antiretroviral treatment regardless of CD4 count or disease stage. Without antiretroviral treatment, an estimated 50 per cent of the children with HIV will die before the age of two. HIV DNA testing is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis in children below 18 months because of the persistence of maternal antibodies until this age. "
19,1,2011,ART for HIV will begin at higher CD4 count soon,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ART-for-HIV-will-begin-at-higher-CD4-count-soon/articleshow/7376275.cms," PUNE: The cut-off level to begin anti-retroviral treatment (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) is set to be raised to 350 CD4 count from the existing 250. The move is expected to bring in better quality of living and help avert co-infections among the HIV infected. “The current evidence in HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3, from the current threshold which is 250,” said Sayan Chatterje, director-general of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). He was in the city to attend the three-day consultative meeting on ‘Galvanising Evidence for HIV Management’ that started at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Bhosari on Thursday. There is widespread consensus that ART should be initiated when CD4 counts drop below 350, and this recommendation is supported by data from cohort studies and results from randomised control trials (RCT), he added. Standard antiretroviral therapy (ART) consists of the use of at least three anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs to suppress the HIV virus and stop its progress. “Huge reductions have been seen in rates of death and suffering when use is made of a potent anti-retroviral regimen,” Chatterjee said. B B Rewari, NACO’s national programme officer (ART), said, “The guidelines for administering ART which is at present given to HIV infected people with CD4 count less than 250 is all set to be revamped. It will be like the US once the cut-off level to get ART treatment is raised to 350 CD4 count.” An earlier start to antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis, Rewari said. In 2006, WHO recommended that all patients start ART when their CD4 count (a measure of immune system strength) falls to 200 cells/mm3 or lower, at which point they typically show symptoms of disease. Since then, studies and trials have clearly demonstrated that starting ART earlier reduces rates of death and disease. WHO has now recommended that ART be initiated at a higher CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3 for all HIV-positive patients, including pregnant women, regardless of symptoms. “There is enough current evidence that suggest that the ART be initiated at a higher CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mm3. The recommendations churned out of this conference will serve to make policy decision in respect of the change in treatment guidelines,” said Nari’s director Ramesh Paranjape. "

Saturday’s delivery takes JJ’s tally of childbirths by HIV-positive women to 1,004 in the last 10 years. This is not an ordinary achievement for J J staffers as not many hospitals are willing to 0take up HIV-positive pregnancy cases. “Most of the HIV-positive pregnant women who come to us are either denied admission by hospitals or are referred to us,” said Dr Rekha Daver, head of obstetrics and gynaecology department at J J. The incidence of the babies born with HIV-positivity also has been low, claims the hospital. “We cannot say exactly how many babies were born HIV positive, as many mothers do not return to get their babies tested. But our estimation says that of all the HIV-positive deliveries, 5-10% of babies get the mother-to-child transfusion,” said Dr Daver, who is also the head of positive parent to child transfusion (PPTCT). The hospital has achieved the feat with the help of a certain medicine and delivery method. “According to the guidelines, we give nevrapin before the delivery. We prefer doing a normal delivery—one without making any incisions—to avoid mixing of the mother’s blood with the baby’s. Also, we give the mother the choice to breastfeed, even though there’s a slight chance of virus transmission,” added Dr Daver. Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), however, agrees that the load of conducting deliveries of HIV-positive women has largely fallen on public hospitals. “Public hospitals get majority of HIV-positive pregnant women as private hospitals do not want to do these deliveries. While the number of HIV-positive women directly coming to the public hospitals is high, those referred from private hospitals is equally high,” said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS. Dr Y S Nandanwar, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Sion Hospital said that they may have assisted in 1,000 positive deliveries too. “We do not have the exact record, but the incidence of conducting an HIV-positive delivery is 1% in our hospital. Since we conduct more than 10,000 normal deliveries in a year, we must be conducting around 100 HIV-positive deliveries,” he said. "

In Mandya district alone, 6,950 HIV cases have been detected, said district health officer Aravindappa. Speaking at a programme `A dialogue with mediapersons on HIV-AIDS,' jointly organized by the health department and NGO networks in Mandya city on Monday, Aravindappa said that around 5 lakh HIV/AIDS cases have been reported in the state. As far as Mandya is concerned, the pace of the spreading of HIV and death rates due to this disease is turning out to be highly worrisome factor. As of today, a total of 2,209 HIV affected persons have registered their names for the standard anti-retroviral therapy (ART) unit at the district hospital, and 1,200 patients are being treated at present, he said. Aravindappa said the role of the media is crucial in curbing the spread of the HIV/AIDS disease. A unified effort of all, including governments, medias, medical fraternity, NGOs and volunteers is very essential in controlling HIV, he said. "
23,2,2011,HIV+ may get medical insurance soon,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-may-get-medical-insurance-soon/articleshow/7406401.cms," NEW DELHI: India could soon see a national medical insurance policy for people living with HIV (PLHIV). In a meeting with insurance companies and the Insurance Regulatory Development Agency on February 3, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) will press them to make insurance ""inclusive and universal for PLHIV"". Currently, HIV is excluded from all insurance policies available in the country ""violating the national mandate of providing stigma free care and support services"". Union health ministry officials said that HIV/AIDS which was earlier regarded as a ""incurable disease"" has now become a ""manageable health problem"" and, therefore, should be included in medical insurance policies. ""Right now, there are individual health schemes in some states which cover certain healthcare related costs of PLHIV. Many health insurance policies exclude services to PLHIV and there is need for a package designed specially for such people. We will discuss global best practices to see how a viable insurance policy can be created for them,"" joint secretary Aradhana Johri told TOI. Another ministry official said, ""Those living with HIV are living longer and have less morbidity cases, thanks to the increase in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage. With timely initiation of ART, PLHIV may live a normal life up to 20 more years. Companies need to realize that covering HIV patients with a medical policy is no more a loss making proposition."" India with a HIV prevalence rate of 0.31% is home to the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world -- 23.9 lakh. Some countries with higher prevalence rates of HIV have already taken measures to mainstream HIV through commercial health insurance cover. These include South Africa (17.8), Namibia (13.1), Uganda (6.5), Guyana (1.2) and United States (0.6). K K Abraham, chief of Indian Network of People Living with HIV, said, ""Insurance is life saving for us."" At present, only Star Health and Allied Insurance has an insurance policy for PLHIVs in four states -- Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. More than 7,000 PLHIVs have subscribed to this insurance which provides a health cover of Rs 30,000 with a yearly premium Rs 1,511. NACO says that with about 89% of all HIV/AIDS infections being in the 15-49 age group, it effects in the most productive years. Currently, the financial burden of treatment and care is shared by NACO and PLHIVs. While NACO pays for ART, PLHIVs face economic burden of travel, nutrition and loss of wages. Recently, India launched the national health insurance scheme, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), for BPL. It is to be rolled out in 366 districts in 29 states. As on December 23, 2010, a total of 22,354,462 smart cards have been issued across 260 districts in 27 states. NACO says, ""HIV has been taken out from the exclusion list making it possible for poor PLHIVs to be covered under health insurance, which can make them entitled to one time hospitalization for nearly 700 in-patient procedures with costs up to Rs 30,000 by paying a minimal registration fee of Rs 30 per annum.""

25,2,2011,'CARA's apathy leaves HIV +ve boy in the lurch',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/CARAs-apathy-leaves-HIV-ve-boy-in-the-lurch/articleshow/7456016.cms," MUMBAI: The fate of a 20-month-old HIV positive boy is hanging in the balance, thanks to the 'apathy' shown by the Central Adoption Resources Agency (CARA), the Bombay high court was told on Tuesday. A Spanish couple had earlier decided to adopt the boy. However, given the delay by CARA in granting a No Objection Certificate (NOC), the couple has now decided against it, said Shirin Merchant, the advocate representing the couple as well as the boy. A division bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice S J Vajifdar was irked to hear that the delay in granting the NOC has left the boy in the lurch and that he will now have to wait till another couple decides to adopt him. The boy was given for adoption by the Pune-based Preet Mandir, which faced suspension following complaints of financial malpractice and human trafficking last year. ""The boy was born to a HIV positive mother and had symptoms of the disease. A Spanish couple still agreed to adopt him in February 2010 and started the formalities, but following CARA's decision to suspend Preet Mandir's licence, the formalities were not completed. Even the boy's health is deteriorating,"" Merchant told the court. Merchant is representing six more foreign couples who agreed to adopt eight children from Preet Mandir. Three couples are from Spain and Italy, one is from Canada. Hearing Merchant's submissions, the judges remarked: ""You (government) are not considering the condition of these children. Unnecessary delay is not only creating hurdles in the adoption procedure, but also seriously affecting welfare of the children who have been selected for adoption."" Merchant told the court that there are 86 children with Preet Mandir waiting for adoption. Of the eight selected for adoption, one is suffering from Hepatitis B and another has a severe orthopaedic problem. ""But the couples still want to adopt them. They can get better treatment once they are adopted,"" Merchant said. Preet Mandir came under the scrutiny of various authorities following a sting operation carried out by a news channel showing that the adoption house sells babies for more money to foreign parents. Sakhee-a Non governmental Organisation (NGO) had filed an application in 2008 seeking an inquiry against Preet Mandir. Preet Mandir's counsel, senior advocate Prasad Dhakepalkar said that the CBI had in 2010 lodged an FIR against just one of the trustees. ""The government should not shut down the adoption facilities because of this FIR. CARA has delayed filing its reply, thereby affecting the adoption procedure,"" Dhakepalkar said. CARA's advocate Vinod Joshi said Preet Mandir's licence was cancelled in May 2010 following complaints of malpractice were received against the adoption house. The HC has directed CARA to decide the six applications by February 28. "
26,2,2011,HIV test for babies to start early,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/HIV-test-for-babies-to-start-early/articleshow/7455527.cms," Ludhiana: In order to diagnose HIV early in newborns, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has decided to launch a programme. Earlier, NACO used to diagnose the HIV status after the baby had turned four months old. However, the new programme would enable them to check the baby when it would be just one month old. The main motive of early diagnosis would be detection of the virus at an early stage to prevent its spread in babies. Talking to TOI, AIDS district project manager Geetika said NACO had been running an HIV diagnosis programme among newborns to detect the presence of HIV virus among children of HIV-infected mothers. ''Now we'll be able to detect the virus when the baby is just one month hold, thus increasing the chances of preventing AIDS,'' she added. According to the prevention programme, HIV-infected women are given medicine during their pregnancy and a dose is given to the newborn at the time of birth. However, other tests are conducted to confirm the presence of HIV infection in the child as well as the mother, said she. She said they would collect samples from Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) at various hospitals in Ludhiana and send them to the Khanna centre for testing, adding the main motive is to know the number children suffering from HIV at early stage and start medication.

27,2,2011,HIV+ baby made to wait for 5 hrs at SCB,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/HIV-baby-made-to-wait-for-5-hrs-at-SCB/articleshow/7463116.cms," CUTTACK: An HIV positive infant had to wait for five hours on Monday for surgery at the SCB Medical College and Hospital. An eight-month-old baby boy suffering from hydrocephalus (a condition of accumulation of fluids in the brain) was scheduled to be operated at around 2 pm on Monday but the surgery started only around 7 in the evening. The child was kept hungry throughout the day, alleged his parents. Neurosurgeons, who carried out the operation, alleged that the delay was due to the anaesthetist, who came in late. The surgeons waited for over five hours in the OT. The anaesthetist attended the operation only after the intervention of the hospital superintendent. ""We had informed the anaesthetist about the surgery in the morning but he did not turn up. We waited for five hours to carry out the operation,"" head of the neurosurgery department S S Mishra alleged. There are allegations that the anaesthetist was hesitant to attend to a HIV positive patient. Refuting the allegations, the anaesthetist Narayan Acharya said, ""The delay in operation has nothing to do with the patient being HIV positive. The child was very sick and special intervention as venesection (where a vein is surgically opened to obtain intravenous access) was required to administer anaesthesia to the patient. But the doctors had not completed the preparations for the surgery on time. I had visited the ward twice but the surgery was delayed due to lack of co-ordination on their part."" But the worst sufferer was the child and his parents. ""The day was painful for us. We also suffered along with our child. The hospital allotted us time for surgery 20 days after admission. But the doctors delayed the process,"" mother of the child said, who had come all the way from Balipadar in Ganjam district. Monday's problem also brought to the fore the insufficient number of anaesthetist in the hospital. Doctors have demanded a team of anaesthetist for the critical department like neuro-surgery. ""Over 30 patients are waiting for surgery in the ward but we are unable to operate them due to unavailability of anaesthetist. We are demanding for special anaesthetist for the department since the past few years but we have not got any yet,"" Mishra said. "
28,2,2011,City scientists bring bad news for HIV cure,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/City-scientists-bring-bad-news-for-HIV-cure/articleshow/7464077.cms," MUMBAI: Commonsense suggests that every sample of blood or fluid drawn from an HIV-positive person would be the same. But a group of researchers in the city has found otherwise. Scientists at the National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) have found in the case of a patient that the genetic sequence of the HIV virus in his blood sample was different from that in his sperm. The institute, located in Parel, operates under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The NIRRH team, led by assistant director Dr Atmaram Bandivdekar, studied samples of HIV patients registered at the J J Hospital. ""We have so far studied blood and semen samples taken from 10 men,"" said Bandivdekar. Dr Alaka Deshpande, in charge of the hospital's anti-retroviral centre, said the study was part of continuing research about HIV-discordant couples of whom only one partner has the virus. The findings shocked the doctors. The genetic sequence of the virus found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was found to be different from that in the spermatozoa. The finding is significant because it underlines the virus's instability. ""HIV is so weak that it cannot replicate completely. Hence, its genetic sequence keeps changing as seen from the same patient's blood and semen samples,"" said Bandivdekar. He believes this continual change is the reason behind medicine's failure to cure a person of HIV or its full-blown manifestation AIDS. ""If the genetic sequence keeps changing, how can we find one medicine to cure all? The findings are going to be published in the forthcoming issue of the Journal of Medical Virology. But for both Bandivdekar and Deshpande, the study's significance lies in that it settles a longstanding debate in the medical fraternity. ""We can no longer say that sperms are 100% free of the virus,"" said Deshpande (it is largely believed that HIV doesn't affect sperms and is found only in seminal fluid). Bandivdekar said the finding would impact the current practice of allowing HIV-positive men to have their own children using infertility treatment. ""While making a test-tube baby in a laboratory, the sperm of an HIV-positive man is washed. But we have to now study if the sperm-wash is indeed completely safe in not transmitting the virus to the embryo."" Deshpande, however, said that many European countries nowadays subjected the HIV-positive man to a regimen of drugs to bring down the viral load in his body. ""Thereafter his sperm is washed and IVF is performed.' HIV is so weak that it cannot replicate completely. Hence, its genetic sequence keeps changing as seen from the same patient's blood and semen samples. If the sequence keeps changing, how can we find one medicine to cure all? "
29,2,2011,HIV+ homemaker turns working woman,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/HIV-homemaker-turns-working-woman/articleshow/7504865.cms," BHUBANESWAR: Ten years after being detected with HIV positive, Sumitra is now hail and hearty. She has transformed from a shy homemaker to a 29-year-old working woman. She earns Rs 3,000 a month and gets free accommodation in the state capital. But, all was not well for her 10 years ago. This Class IX dropout, who hailed from Narayanpur village in Kendrapada district, was in her teens when she fell in love with Abhay Behera, a youth of her age. Abhay had just started working at a cloth factory in Surat. ""I eloped with Abhay against my family's wishes. It was for me a perfect married life. Well that is what I thought for the next few years,"" Sumitra recalls with a smile. ""Within two years, we were blessed with a baby boy. Both our families had also accepted us by then,"" she says. But she was oblivious of the fact that days after landing in Surat, she had contracted HIV from her husband in 2001. ""I was tested HIV+ during a routine pre-natal check-up during my first pregnancy in 2003. I must have contracted it much earlier, because my husband had been tested positive years ago. I got to know this just five years ago in 2006 during my second pregnancy,"" she narrated. ""Earlier, my husband had hidden his disease from me. He probably thought that since our son had tested negative, there was nothing to worry about. He had debarred me from breastfeeding him giving me some lame reasons, which I did not comprehend, but let go anyway,"" she said. When Sumitra was pregnant for the second time, her husband was suffering from high fever that required hospitalisation. They returned to Orissa to treat him. ""That is when he revealed to me our HIV+ status and said that he would not live long. He died two months later,"" Sumitra said. She then got worried and took another test in Kendrapada. There she tested positive. That was not all, her new-born child also tested positive a few months later. That is when she felt the world was crashing down on her. Even as she was trying to overcome the grief of her husband's death, villagers started avoiding her and almost ostracised her. ""Both the in-laws and my parents were reluctant to take me in. After much persuasion, my parents agreed to raise my elder son since he had tested negative,"" she recalls. ""I was thinking of ending my life along with my second child. But then, some HIV/AIDS volunteers counselled me,"" she said tearfully. With her month-old child in tow, Sumitra moved to Angul and started life afresh. She took a job of a maid for an NGO and in turn found shelter. Later, she moved to Bhubaneswar and joined a community centre for AIDS patients as an attendant. ""Although her profile is that of a house-keeper, she also helped counsel inmates using her own life story as a case in point,"" says Dr Dilip Samal, convenor of Medics, the NGO that runs the 10-bed indoor facility for AIDS patients. She gets Rs 3,000 a month and accommodation in return for her service. Interestingly, Sumitra has not fallen ill all these years. Nor has she undergone an anti-retroviral therapy. ""Her CD4 count (blood cell that gets affected in case of HIV) is good. She doesn't require medication,"" said Dr Samal. Besides, CD4 count of her younger son, Sivam Prakash, is improving. Sumitra gets to see her elder son Om Prakash once every three months when she travels to Kendrapada to collect her pension that she gets as a widow of an AIDS patient. "
30,2,2011,HIV+ maid had sex with 100 men: Doc,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/HIV-maid-had-sex-with-100-men-Doc/articleshow/7524415.cms," MUMBAI: A doctor treating HIV-positive patients has claimed that one of his patients has indulged in sexual relations with more than 100 partners ""to take revenge"" for her condition. Dr I S Gilada, who heads an AIDS clinic at Grant Road, told TOI that a 29-year-old woman from the Western suburbs has been visiting him since the past two months. While counselling her, the doctor learnt that she not only has multiple partners, but hunts for them with a vengeance to spread the virus she contracted through her husband. ""She was brought to us by her sister, who herself is HIV positive,"" said Gilada. ""We found out that she had learnt of her husband's HIV-positive status in 2005, and that he had transmitted the disease to her as well. Although she divorced him, she couldn't come to terms with the fact that he had knowingly passed on the virus to her,"" he said. Gilada said that during the counselling sessions, the woman, who works as a maid, claimed she has had more than 300 sexual encounters with 100 men over the past three years. ""She admitted to frequent encounters with men ranging from her employers and their relatives, to the liftman and students - all of whom have had unprotected sex with her,"" said Gilada. When asked about the case, Dr S S Kudalkar, president at the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), said the organization would investigate the matter. ""We will talk to the clinic and investigate the case. If it is true, then we will counsel the woman,"" he said. ""HIV is not just a disease of the virus, it is also a disease of human behaviour. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has mandated pre-test and post-test counselling to curb patients from forging sexual contacts with multiple partners,"" said Dr Kudalkar. "

""Will you find a permanent solution for preventing HIV/AIDS by discovering anti-HIV vaccine,"" Kalam said addressing the students, scientists and academicians of Central University of Jharkhand (CUJ) in a packed auditorium on Friday. He was speaking at a seminar on Biotechnology and National Development: Achievements and Challenges on the university campus in Brambe, around 30 km from here. Jharkhand Governor M O H Farook, chief minister Arjun Munda and CUJ vice-chancellor D T Khating were present. During the past one decade, Kalam has interacted with more than 11 million youths in India and abroad. Among other challenges thrown before the budding bio-technologists by the Missile Man was to find a viable solution for preventing highly prevalent malaria by developing a vaccine. ""Will you find a biotechnology solution to increase food grain production to 340 million tonnes in another nine years from the present production of 230 million tonnes?"" Kalam asked. This was not the end of the challenges for the scientists from the man who still inspires the youths. The scientist also asked them to find a solution to combat cardio-vascular diseases and diabetes. ""Will you be able to find a diagnosis and solution for cardio-vascular diseases which is widely prevalent among Indians at young age wherever they are? Can you friends find a permanent solution for curing the diabetics? Will young friends and biotechnologists promote research in preventive healthcare through timely life style modification?"" said Kalam leaving almost everyone present in the auditorium speechless for a few moment. The former President also dedicated the book Biotechnology for Sustainable Development: Achievement and Challenges authored by a number of biotechnologists to commemorate the contribution of Prof A B Prasad towards the development of biotechnology in Jharkhand and Bihar.

32,2,2011,HIV+ man killed Kota cop to protest 'inaction',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/HIV-man-killed-Kota-cop-to-protest-inaction/articleshow/7574297.cms," JAIPUR: The man who murdered a constable at a police outpost in Kota late Thursday night is an HIV patient who is now on the run, the police claimed on Friday. It is believed the 32-year-old man was annoyed at the police's alleged apathy in acting upon the complaint he lodged with the outpost two days before the murder. The killer is said to be a short-tempered man who shared no good relations with members of his family or the neighbours, the investigators said. His incurable disease made him an irritable person, a senior police officer said of the accused. The police zeroed in on the HIV patient on learning that the local reporters received strange calls from him shortly before and after the murder of the 50-year-old constable, Nand Lal. Minutes after killing the cop in cold blood, the accused called up local media persons. ""He claimed they would have to publish what he had done' and then switched off his mobile phone,"" SP Kota city, Prafulla Kumar told TOI. The accused had earlier approached the media persons wanting them to publish articles against the police inaction but the reporters suggested him to contact senior police officers. The accused is a resident of Kesua locality under the Kota's Prem Nagar police outpost. Preliminary police investigations have revealed that the man had a dispute with his neighbours on Tuesday and approached the Prem Nagar outpost staff, asking them to take action in the matter. ""Nand Lal accepted the complaint and assured him of appropriate action against the guilty. But the man was not satisfied and approached the local media,"" the SP said. Nand Lal was alone at the outpost when the man sneaked in and attacked him from behind with a sharp-edged weapon on Thursday night. As per the police, the man pre-planned the murder as he had packed luggage of the entire family before killing the constable. He even settled his dues with the firm where he worked as driver. "

He said asked all Congress workers in Punjab work at village level to make the masses aware protection against HIV and to stop discrimination against AIDS patients. On Punjab politics, Fernandes, who is also general secretary of Congress, said only deserving candidate will be given tickets to fight in 2012 Assembly elections. "
34,3,2011,Gurgaon to have high-tech lab to design anti-HIV vaccine,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Gurgaon-to-have-high-tech-lab-to-design-anti-HIV-vaccine/articleshow/7613978.cms," NEW DELHI: Gurgaon will now be home to the country's first state-of-the-art laboratory that will exclusively work to design an effective vaccine against the deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), an autonomous institute under the department of biotechnology (DBT), and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), have signed an agreement to jointly establish, operate and fund this HIV vaccine design programme. The programme will primarily focus on one of the greatest scientific challenges of AIDS vaccine design and development - the search of antibodies capable of neutralizing a broad spectrum of circulating HIV strains. Bringing hope to the idea of developing an effective vaccine against the deadly virus, scientists have been working on powerful new antibodies that neutralise all major forms of the virus. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus. Studies have found that antibodies target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate - a defence mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines. Experts in this Indian lab will now look at new antibodies and how they bind to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus to target with vaccines. The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection. ""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable to the fight against HIV and AIDS. A broadly effective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset to efforts to arrest the spread of HIV,"" said M K Bhan, secretary of DBT. This collaborative programme will participate in a coordinated, global effort to create replicas of virus targets in the laboratory for use as immunogens, which are the active ingredients of vaccines. The programme will have the task of developing, testing and then implementing strategies to rapidly screen large numbers of immunogens against HIV-1 (dominant strain) and to prioritize them for further evaluation in preclinical studies. ""We are very excited about the launch of this collaboration,"" said Seth Berkley, CEO of IAVI. Other institutions participating in this partnership include the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in New Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Indians, too, are being screened for such effective HIV slaying antibodies. The country has its share of ""late progressors"" or ""elite controllers"" - people infected with HIV who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). About one in 300 people with HIV is an elite controller. Meanwhile, another fascinating community - mainly comprising women - has also got scientists in India excited. Called ""exposed sero negative"" these are women who have, for years, had sex with HIV-positive, condom-refusing husbands, but never got infected. Many have also had babies who are not HIV-positive. Scientists are studying these elite controllers to see whether they carry special genes, which prevent the virus from multiplying in their bodies. The cure for AIDS may come from members of these two communities, scientists believe. "
35,3,2011,HIV+ patients protest against controversial EU-India FTA,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/HIV-patients-protest-against-controversial-EU-India-FTA/articleshow/7615868.cms," NEW DELHI: Thousands of HIV positive people from India and across Asia marched from Ramlila ground to Jantar Mantar on Wednesday to protest against the free trade agreement (FTA) between European Union (EU) and India, which has provisions that would restrict access to affordable medicines. India signing the FTA would affect not only the people of India but also the people in several other developing countries that depend on Indian manufacturers for good quality affordable medicines. Though government officials have been claiming that none of the provisions in the FTA would affect India’s ability to produce cheap and effective medicines, the fact that the government is not making the documents of the agreement public is raising suspicion about the actual nature of the contents. One of the most damaging provisions in the FTA is the grant of data exclusivity, something that the Indian Patent Law does not allow at present as Parliament did not think this would work in the interest of the Indian public’s need for affordable medicines. Data exclusivity would mean that clinical trial data filed by one company cannot be relied upon by any other company. Each company will have to produce its own clinical trial data, which would be a waste of resources as different companies subject people to repeat clinical and pre-clinical trials to prove the efficacy of the same drug. Moreover data submitted by a company will be protected for five to ten years preventing the registration of equally effective generic medicines during the time. "

Not because she's scared of studies. What dithers her is this constant fear of her friends getting to know of her HIV-affected status. ""We cannot play, eat, or sit with other students. Even if we are studying in the same class, we are treated differently all the time. None of the kids in my neighbourhood talks to me because my parents are HIV positive,"" she says. In an interactive session with the HIV-positive community organized by World Vision India on Friday, affected patients shared their side of the story, of how they fight discrimination on a day-to-day basis. Violation of child rights topped their complaints. According to Gayatri (name changed), an HIV-positive member of the Karnataka AIDS patients network, child counsellors and paediatric doctors were missing in almost all antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres. ""The HIV epidemic has been around for three decades now and children from the first group of patients have reached the age group of 18 and 19 years. They need support and understanding of how they can move ahead."" The aggrieved lot urged the government to pass the much-awaited HIV Bill. The legislation aims at ensuring equal rights for people living with HIV (PLHIV) at work, healthcare centres or in education. The bill also has provisions for a safe working environment for health workers and recognizes the rights of children to healthcare and information. The members insisted on better diagnostic facilities for kids. ""An HIV-positive network member from Bellary passed away yesterday after both his kidneys failed. This, due to side-effects from ART. He had no facilities for dialysis in Bellary. So he had no option but to come all the way to Bangalore. There's no support-system for HIV-positive persons in the districts, specially for children,"" added Neha (name changed), another HIV-positive person. "

What next? College, one would say. But these students ask: ""Who will admit children like us?'' The IT city with increasing number of schools and colleges still has no place for these HIV +ve students. Even corporation schools do little to accommodate them. The students are from Infant Jesus children's home in Kothanur, located on the way to the Bengaluru International Airport. Nishitha, Shalini, Syria and Hemalatha are the first batch of HIV positive children here to write their Class 10 exam this April through the national open school system. They are confident they will do the exams well and dream of a bright future. Nishitha wants to become a doctor to find a cure for children like her while Shalini intends to become a teacher who will love students like her. But their immediate future remains bleak. The four girls had no answer when asked where they plan to join after class 10. ""We don't know,'' they say. The home was inaugurated in March 2001. Even after a decade, it's not easy to find a proper school for these kids. The four had lost a year in between as no school would admit them. They were earlier sent to the corporation school nearby. But could not continue there for long due to the students and some teachers' indifference. According to the management here, the few who were admitted to schools came back depressed not willing to get back to any school again. Some even develop aversion to studies. As a way out, the management started a school within the campus. Now with the first batch completing class 10, their major concern is what next. ""There are many volunteers and donors willing to help us with money and even in kind. Our greatest challenge remains in finding a proper place to get these children educated without any discrimination. We hope to find a way out soon,'' says sister Pratibha DSS, co-ordinator. She recalls the early years when they had problems even getting cooks. ""Our first cook left within a few days saying her landlord refused to give house to a person working for the HIV positive. It took some years to get over such problems. However, only education remains a block,'' she explained. THE LEGAL SIDE According to legal experts, no child can be denied admission in school because he/she is HIV positive. ""The greatest challenge in monitoring such cases of discrimination is that it happens in lower strata of society. Unless somebody raises voice about it, it's difficult to find solutions,'' says state advocate general Ashok Haranahalli. The Bombay High Court on January 20, 2004 had ruled that HIV-positive people cannot be denied jobs. Doing so infringes on their constitutional right to earn a livelihood and right to equality. What about such children's right to education? "

According to the students, teachers questioned them in the school, asking them whether they were HIV positive, if they take their medicines regularly and what food they eat at the hostel. The teachers asked them to leave the school and return with their parents. Headmistress of the school P G Udikeri told TOI, ""We don't allow HIV positive children in the school as the parents of other students oppose it."" She also said there was a separate school for these children in Sadashiv Nagar. Recently, parents stopped sending their children to a government school in Sadashiv Nagar when they found that HIV positive children were studying there. Mahesh Jadhav, head of an NGO, said all seven children who were sent away from the school were not HIV positive and he had informed the headmistress of this. ""Despite this, the teachers have humiliated the children in the school, which is unfortunate,"" he said. DDPI V M Patil visited the school in the afternoon and hauled up the teachers for the incident. He warned them of stringent action if such a thing happened in the future. V B Kulkarni, district AIDS prevention control officer, said what happened in Kanabargi School was unfortunate and showed that there is a need to create awareness among teachers about HIV and AIDS. ""We will carry the (awareness) campaign shortly,"" he said. "

However, the number of countries, which have such laws, has increased from 56% to 71% between 2006 and 2010. According to a new report released by United Nations Secretary-General on Friday to commemorate 30 years of the outbreak of HIV/AIDS, less than 60% countries have a mechanism to record cases of HIV-related discrimination. Around 49 countries impose some form of restriction on the entry, stay and residence of people living with HIV. Dozens of countries criminalize HIV transmission. The report, recommendations of which will be reviewed by global leaders at the UN General Assembly high- level meeting on AIDS that will be held in New York on June 8-10, said, “The year 2011 marks 30 years of AIDS. In that time, AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives and more than 60 million people have become infected with HIV. Still, each day, more than 7,000 people are newly-infected with the virus, including 1,000 children. Stigma and discrimination continue to undermine efforts to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support.” "

According to an official release, the minister pointed out that due to consistent campaigns by various agencies the infection rate came down substantially in the state which now occupies fourth position among the six high HIV/AIDS prevalent states in the country. He informed the Unicef officials that few months back Nagaland was unfortunately placed second in the list of high prevalent states, however, with the assistance of NSACS, Legislators' Forum, Churches and NGOs the state has been brought down to fourth sloth with a prevalence rate of below one. Besides receiving assistance from NACO and other external aids, the Legislators' Forum on AIDS (LFA) contributes Rs 60 lakh annually (each MLA contributes Rs 1 lakh) to the Nagaland's battle against AIDS. The LFA fund is primarily used for creating awareness in respective legislative constituencies, the minister told the delegation. Informing about the introduction of nutritional support and reproductive health education in school curriculum, the minister for School Education Nyeiwang Konayk impressed upon the Unicef to help strengthening these efforts.

Currently, Jaisalmer is categorised as one of the low-risk areas but the rapid increase in HIV prevalence is threatening to take the desert district among the list of high-risk ones. As per official records, Jaisalmer falls under the D category in a scale where A category is for the highest risk and severely affected areas. The categorisation is done by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) after an annual surveillance of the number of cases in every district. According to officials of the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RACS), the trend and the rate of spread have not changed much in the district. However, people concerned argue that Jaisalmer may soon make it to the B category. ""From 2005 to 2007, only a few hundred tests were done at our testing centre and the number of positive cases were very few. From 2008, the number of tests run into thousands. In 2009-10, 11,000 tests were conducted, of which 61 were positive, which is 0.55%,'' a RACS official said. On the other hand, the Jaisalmer Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS started in 2009 with 10 members. Today, the number is 106 and counting. ""In the month of February, 16 new members mostly from the rural areas joint the network,'' Hairsh Khichar, president of the network, said. ""Most of the members have been tested positive recently only. Not everybody who tests positive agrees to be part of the network and the number of the actual HIV positive people in the district might be much more.'' Manager of Target Intervention Project Jugna Swami, who works with the high risk groups, said the spread of the HIV virus in the district is alarming. ""More so, given the fact that the population density of Jaisalmer is much lower compared to other districts of the state,'' she said. The migrating population of rural Jaisalmer tops the list of identified high-risk groups, closely followed by the sex workers and the camel-riders. According to Jugna, a survey in 2009 revealed that 1,140 camel owners in the district were involved in prostitution. In the kacchi-bastis of Jaisalmer, hundreds of house-wives have multiple partners and are also involved in prostitution. ""However, carriers of the virus are the hundreds of local migrant labourers, who spend months in bigger cities like Mumbai and Ahmedabad and carry back the virus with them,'' said Jugna, adding that the situation has deteriorated for the worse in the last four or five years. ""It's because of these migrants that women and children too are getting infected,"" Jugna claimed. Her NGO distributes over 70,000 condoms to the high-risk groups every month. Jaisalmer town alone has 19 condom-distributing depos. Two dispensing boxes have been fitted in Sam specially for the tourists and the camel riders. "

It is because of this migrating population that the women and children too face the risk of turning HIV positive. Though Jaisalmer is a low-risk area for now, the increase in number of HIV positive and AIDS cases has become a major concern for the district. According to experts, thousands of labourers travel to big cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and others, mainly for work. ""These laboureres spend months in big cities and often are involved in unsafe sex and and carry back the virus with them,'' said Jugna Swami, who works with the high-risk groups in the district. She claimed the situation has deteriorated in the past four or five years. ""It's because of these migrants that women and children too are getting infected,"" Jugna claimed. She adds after the migrants, it is the sex-workers in the district who fall in the high-risk group. ""It is not uncommon for housewives in the slum areas of Jaisalmer to have multiple partners and a number of them are involved in prostitution as well,'' she said. Volunteers working on the AIDS programme in the district regularly visit the high-risk groups, couselling them and ensuring they agree to a full medical check-up every three months. A recent survey conducted by NACO estimated the number of sex-workers in Jaisalmer town alone to be about 1,500. This apart, a 2009 survey revealed that 1,140 camel owners in the district were involved in prostitution. Jugna's NGO distributes over 70,000 condoms to the high-risk groups every month. Jaisalmer town alone has 19 condom-distributing depos. Two dispensing boxes have been fitted in Sam specially for the tourists and the camel riders. ""Reports suggest that even foreign tourists are involved with the camel riders, specially when they opt for long camel safaris in the desert. Over the past two years, special efforts have been made to counsel the camel-riders. Though, in most cases, foreign tourists are known to play safe and take all precautions,'' admitted Jugna. "

This matter was highlighted in Parliament recently that HIV infected children continue to face discrimination even in their schools. The government has told Lok Sabha in reply to a question that 61 students were thrown out of schools in the country over the last 3 years and of these, four HIV positive students were from Gujarat. Apart from these four, there was also one incident of discrimination reported from Ahmedabad. However, complaints and timely action by the officials prevented the students from moving out of the schools. The government quoted National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) in saying that these 61 children infected by HIV were removed from the schools in various instances during 2008-2010. The discrimination cases were reported from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The central government said that advocacy programs are conducted to sensitise principals and teachers to ensure that students with HIV/AIDS are treated with dignity and respect. National AIDS control Organization (NACO) and State AIDS Control Society along with their state and district level networks also conduct advocacy programmes with various stakeholders including school principals and teachers.

49,4,2011,'Stigma prevents access to HIV services’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Stigma-prevents-access-to-HIV-services/articleshow/8043102.cms," PUNE: The two-day state-level convention of MSM (men having sex with men), Saptarang (Rainbow), that concluded in Panhala on Wednesday had participants unanimously asserting that the stigma, discrimination and criminalisation faced by the community prevent universal access to HIV prevention services, treatment, care and support. Darshana Vyas, project director, Pathfinder International, said, ""The convention was held at Panhala (Kolhapur district) and was an attempt to re-energise the MSM community, strengthen community feeling and leverage greater leadership and involvement in project governance and implementation."" She said that community-based organisations (CBOs) formed so far, have to gradually evolve into a state-level federation acting as a constant support to the community and giving voice to their issues. ""We not only need to ensure that the community is made part of the mainstream, but also continue and scale our efforts to reach the unreached."" The convention was organised by Pathfinder International which has been implementing the Mukta project to reduce prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS among the most at risk populations such as female sex workers (FSW), MSMs and their partners. Now working in five districts of Maharashtra, the project seeks to transition the management and implementation of the HIV programme to CBOs. The convention held at Panhala brought together around 300 community members from six districts of Maharashtra, namely Kolhapur, Latur, Nasik, Beed, Pune and Yavatmal where CBOs have been formed. Various groups and institutions working with the MSM community such as Samabhavana Society, Samapathik and Udaan also attended the convention. The event included guided discussions on strengthening communication for behaviour change, raising awareness on human rights, entitlements and imparting micro-planning, leadership and team-building skills. Sameer Kumta, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that supports HIV prevention programmes in the districts, underlined the need for leadership from within the community and called upon the members to take ownership of the work and share responsibilities. ""It is only through collective efforts that we can address newer challenges, while contributing effectively towards bringing down the HIV prevalence rates,"" he said, adding that the convention was a platform to rethink the communication, leadership and management strategies for a stronger community-led HIV response. Kumar (name changed) a Kolhapur-based peer educator, said, ""Coming together proved helpful in understanding how we can collectively address issues such as adherence to ART, consistent condom use, diagnosis and treatment of STIs, voluntary HIV testing, etc. We hope to carry home learnings from this workshop and use it to reach out to the community at our level."" In the session on legal literacy, participants were informed about rights of the community and applicable legal provisions. Raju, another MSM from Latur, while sharing his learning from the session, said there are some laws that criminalise sexual acts between members of the same sex. ""We must collectively challenge such laws and policies that abuse human rights and limit fundamental freedom,"" he said. Pathfinder International has facilitated FSW and MSM CBOs in Kolhapur, Latur, Nashik, Beed, Pune and Yavatmal districts and has successfully handed over six district interventions to the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society as part of the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP III). The project has been successful in decreasing STI rates among FSWs and MSM by over 30% in the last five years. The convention, Saptarang (Rainbow), held at Panhala brought together around 300 community members from Kolhapur, Latur, Nashik, Beed, Pune. "
50,4,2011,Most HIV-hit kids lose parents to AIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Most-HIV-hit-kids-lose-parents-to-AIDS/articleshow/8095008.cms," MUMBAI: More than half the HIV-positive children in Maharashtra have lost one of their parents to the disease and a high number have lost both their parents. According to a study done by CHAHA, a care and support programme for children affected with HIV, Maharashtra ranks high in the list of states that have more than two HIV positive members in a family. Between June 2007 and March 2011, CHAHA reached out to a total of 64,056 children and families affected by HIV and AIDS in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Manipur. Out of these, 38% of families were found to be headed by women, many of who had to turn to prostitution to sustain their families. ""There were a total of 21,000 HIV positive children in the ten districts of Maharashtra, 52% of which had lost one of their parents to the disease and 17% had lost both their parents. The numbers were higher than that of the other three states,"" said Manoj Pardeshi, general secretary of Network of Maharashtra for people living with HIV. It was also found that the status of children remains unknown especially after the death of their parents. ""It is only when the child gets an infection and falls ill, that he/she is taken to a hospital and it is there that their HIV status is found out. Because of the delay in detection, most of the time, even the treatment is delayed,"" said Sonal Mehta from HIV/AIDS Alliance India. ""A total of 13,001 children were encouraged to go for HIV tests by the programme, of which about 11% were found to be positive,"" she added. The programme found that the needs of the HIV positive people were different and everything could not be provided by the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. ""For example, those children who were young are now growing up to be adolescents. Their needs are different and they have to be counselled differently from the ten-year-olds’”. In an ART centre, which provides the medicine, this kind of counselling is not available. We go from house to house and work on a personal level,"" said Shabana Patel from the National AIDS programme. The programme, which had been running on global funds, is now struggling to carry on with the work with HIV-affected families. ""The funds were given to us for five years in dollars. But since the value of dollars fell, the funds have got over in three years itself. We have asked for help from the National AIDS Control Program (NACO) and the Central government,"" Patel said. "
51,4,2011,HIV positive population on the rise in Rajasthan,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/HIV-positive-population-on-the-rise-in-Rajasthan/articleshow/8121222.cms," JAIPUR: Rajesh (name changed) had gone to donate blood to fulfil a social obligation at a camp organised here but he was completely shattered when the blood he donated was found to be HIV positive. His incident has brought to the fore the grim reality of the high prevalence of HIV positive people in the state who are not aware of their status. The recently released data of people, who donated blood in the last one financial year in the entire state, shows that among the donors as many as 819 were HIV positive. These people are not aware of the fact that they are carriers of the virus. All donated bloods are subjected to laboratory tests and if found HIV positive, are completely destroyed. Statistics show that there are 83 registered blood banks in the state, which collect blood through camps and also through replacement. In the last financial year, around 555 people went to the camps orgainsed by social organizations, hospitals and blood banks and donated blood voluntarily. Of the 4,57,304 people who donated blood from April 2010 to March 2011, 819 donors were found positive for HIV implying that one out of 558 people, who donated blood was carrying the AIDS virus. According to the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society, transfusion of HIV-infected blood is also a major reason for transmission of the virus. The society stated that one should take blood only from a licenced blood bank where it is tested for HIV. Jaipur, which has highest number of blood banks in the state, found 326 such cases registered in the last financial year. In Jodhpur, such cases were recorded at 90, Ajmer 47, Alwar 44, Bhilwara 27, Udaipur 40 and in Bikaner 25 such cases were found. In 2008, around 3,90,899 people had donated blood out of which 764 were HIV positive, and in 2009 the figure increased to 808, in the same year 3,94,917 people had donated blood. The state government is now taking the issue seriously and kick-started awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS where folk artistes were roped in to interact with people in their local dialects on the requisite precautions to be taken for the disease.

52,5,2011,HIV+ to get blood free of cost,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/HIV-to-get-blood-free-of-cost/articleshow/8130329.cms," LUCKNOW: In a major relief to HIV+ and those suffering from diseases like haemophilia, thalassemmia, sickle cell anaemia, the state government has decided that they can get blood and its components free from all government and National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) supported blood banks. Most of these blood banks are based in the government hospitals and medical colleges/institutions. A government order relating to blood and blood products was issued recently. The order mentions the category of patients who can procure blood and its components free of charges. The category also includes destitute, patients from below poverty line, pregnant women admitted under the Janani Suraksha Yojana, prisoners and disabled. ""The decision aims to cut procedural crap to save the lives of persons in need,'' Mani Prasad Mishra, special secretary, who issued the GO, said. Mishra also headed the committee which recommended changes in the government blood and component availaibility policy. ""The said order is going to be of great help to all those who need blood frequently and in large quantity,'' Vinay Manchanda of Haemophilia Society of India said. The committee comprising director generals of medical education and health, joint director, UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS), Dr Ashok Shukla, consultant blood safety, UPSACS, Dr Dheeraj Khetan, head, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Dr RS Dubey, incharge blood bank, Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University Dr Tulika Chandra also recommended slashing rates of blood and blood components for other patients. As per the revised rate, a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and whole blood would cost Rs 400. A sum of Rs 200 has been fixed for a unit of fresh frozen plasma and random donor platelets concentrate. Blood component,cryoprecipitate, would be available at Rs 100. A universal rate of Rs 850 for blood and its components was fixed by National Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) in April 2008. However, the decision invited ire, specially when seen in the context of government and NACO supported blood banks. ""The logic was that NACO was already giving funds to support the blood banks while the patients coming at these centres mainly hailed from poorer sections of the society,'' shared a member. The NBTC recommendation for universal charge said that the rates could be subsidised further after approval from its state counterpart -- SBTC. Using its power, the rates of blood in UP came down to Rs 250 for patients undergoing treatment in the hospitals while Rs 500 for other patients. The new order has slashed the rates further. Authorities, however, clarified that the new rates would not be applicable in private sector blood banks. "

They organised programmes to sensitise people. Lata Singh, programme cordinator of FXB India Suraksha, said 15 lakh children are homeless due to HIV in India. The situation is getting worse in Rajasthan despite the government's massive awareness programmes, she added. ""Jaipur has around 2,000 HIV positive children. This data is collected with the help of NGOs and hospitals. However, many of them are out of the reach of both,"" added Singh. Suraksha organised this programme at Virandavan marriage garden. They called around 20 HIV positive children along with activist working for rights of these children and government officials. During the programme some children narrated their tragic tales through songs. Sukhdev Singh (name changed) (14), a HIV positive says how his uncle abandoned him outside railway station in Solapur barely months after the death of his parents in a road accident. After living at the mercy of beggars at the station for some days, he came to Jaipur on the train and started consuming drugs. Here he was spotted by this NGO. After a medical test it was revealed that he is HIV positive. Since then, he underwent many counselling sessions and started going to school. Singh fears that people discriminate against HIV positives despite the government's massive awareness programmes. RU Professor Shashi Sahay addressed HIV positive students. She said that biggest challenge for civil society is to bring them into the mainstream. "

A home for HIV affected children, the institution is awash with pride that the four children who appeared for their HSC exam this year have all passed and two of them with distinction. ""It's a good start for them,"" said Chitra Muthupandian. ""Their circumstances usually make it difficult for them to concentrate on studies."" This was more than true for 19-year-old Kumar*, a resident of Anandha Illam, who scored 66% in the examinations. An HIV infected student who lost both his parents to the disease, Kumar had dropped out of school in 7th standard due to various ailments that plagued him. ""Kumar himself later chose to resume his studies,"" added Chitra. Today, for Kumar, his score of 730 is ticket to a better life. ""I expected better marks, still I am happy with these marks,"" said Kumar. ""I am planning to do my Bachelors in computer sciences. Hopefully, I shall be able to get into Madras University itself."" A similar sentiment was echoed by Geetha*, another resident of the institution who scored 56%. ""I could have scored more marks, but this would to do, I guess,"" she said with a shrug. Though not infected by HIV herself, Geetha lost both her parents to AIDS. Today her sole family is her younger sister, who is HIV positive. Well aware of the disease that killed her parents, Geetha tends to get upset and disturbed whenever her sister falls ill, said employees at the home. Possibly that's what prompted Geetha towards her chosen field nursing. ""I am trying for BSc Nursing,"" she said. ""Hopefully, I'll get a seat in a good college."" The toppers at the home are two sisters, the elder scoring 83% while the younger one scored 78%. Daughters of HIV infected parents, Revathi* and Raagini* live at the home with their mother who doubles up as a cook. Their father succumbed to the disease a long time ago. But even happy moments like these tend to have a hint of gloom caused by absence of families, say officials at the home. ""Happy though they are with their achievement, they do tend to feel bad that they have no family to share it with,"" said Chitra. ""It makes all the difference in the world when a parent is around to motivate you and share in your joys."" * Names changed to protect identities "
55,5,2011,A home away from home for HIV+ orphans,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/A-home-away-from-home-for-HIV-orphans/articleshow/8211828.cms," JAIPUR: It’s home away from home for the 20 children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. The double-storey house in Sector 6 of Malviya Nagar looks humble but it is a paradise for these impoverished children who themselves are carriers of the HIV and had faced social stigma after their parents succumbed to the deadly virus or abandoned them. When these children were found abandoned, Smriti Singh, who founded the AIDS care centre under the Faith Foundation, working for HIV positive orphans, adopted them. “They are my best friends. To see them grow healthier is my life’s aim,” the samaritan said. Smriti is among very few people in the city who came forward to help the HIV positive children. She is fondly called ‘Maa’ by these kids. Everyday, they ran towards the gate to receive her and she, too, doesn’t forget to bring chocolates for them. Most of the children aged between six and 16 years were found abandoned in various parts of the state. The latest inmate to join the care centre is eight-year-old Raghu. The pale and thin boy weighs only 12 kilos. He was found HIV positive after his mother was admitted to hospital in 2009. She died after a prolonged illness in 2010. His father left him alone as he left for work in Gujarat. “Most of them were subjected to discrimination in their respective areas. They were ill-treated by their close relatives after knowing their status,” Smriti said. The SMS Hospital, where they were brought initially for treatment, recommended these children to the care centre, which provided them food, shelter and treatment, apart from their schooling at a nearby institute. “In the school, they never face any problem. They mingle with other kids, play with them and exchange notes,” Smriti said. To make the children feel at home, she stuff the centre with toys, puzzles, pool table, cricket and badminton kits. The house has four rooms with each of them having colourful paintings and drawing by the children. A special study room with computers and general knowledge charts is also there where the children undergo many activities, including exercises, fun games and puzzles to sharpen their mind. On the children’s health, Smriti said, “These kids are prone to seasonal diseases and often require intense medication. Hence, I stocked all kinds of medicines in all corners of house.” Kausal, a volunteer at the foundation, said, “I monitor everyone during meals. These kids require nutritional food to help them grow and fight against diseases.” To make the life of these children exciting, the foundation plans to take them on a trip to Goa. “The kids are now very excited about their flight to Goa. Throughout the day, they make plans on how they will make most of the trip,” Kausal said. Also, volunteers both from India and abroad spend quality time with the children at the home during summer months or their pre-job breaks. “I share happiness and my time with them. It gives me immense pleasure to teach them English,” said Pauline Agache, a language student from Belgium, on her visit to the care home. The foundation generate funds by organising luncheons and dinners for the corporate houses as it does not take direct donations and grants. "

After nine months of treatment in Pingalwara, Dimpy (name changed), 19, is now a familiar face here. Dimpy learns stitching and embroidery and helps fellow patients and other inmates. ""I don`t remember how I came here. My family never tried to trace me,"" she said. Poornima (name changed), another patient from West Bengal, who is undergoing treatment for the past two years, shared similar thoughts. Others are from Uttaranchal and Punjab. ""People who discriminate against HIV patients should take a lesson from here,"" said Pingalwara administrator Darshan Singh Bawa on Monday. He said that all inmates shared food and lodging. Medical social worker Gulshan Ranjan said that before patients are admitted, they are sent for medical examination at Guru Nanak Dev Medical College. ""Regular medical checks of HIV patients are conducted to know their immunity level,"" he said. Ward in charge Promilla said that these HIV patients are otherwise healthy and could look after themselves. Foundation of Pingalwara was laid in 1934 when a spastic child was found abandoned in front of Gurdwara Dera Sahib, Lahore. Head granthi gave the custody of the child to Bhagat Puran Singh, who for 14 years, took care of the kid. After partition, Bhagat Puran Singh set up a camp at Khalsa College and then at Pingalwara, which is now a home to thousands. "
57,5,2011,Another trial for HIV vaccine fails,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Another-trial-for-HIV-vaccine-fails/articleshow/8259751.cms," NEW DELHI: The hunt for an effective vaccine against the lethal HIV remains elusive. In a phase-II double-blind, randomized test-of-concept study, another promising vaccine candidate — MRKAd5 HIV-1 — has failed to protect the subjects. Announced in the Lancet on Thursday, the paper says ""the MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine did not prevent HIV-1 infection or lower viral-load. The high incidence rates of HIV highlight the crucial need for intensified efforts to develop an efficacious vaccine."" The MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine was designed to ensure T-cells-mediated immune responses that would provide complete or partial protection from HIV-1 infection or a decrease in viral load after being administered. The study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in five sites in South Africa. The vaccine and placebo were given by intramuscular injections on a 0, 1, 6-month schedule to about 800 subjects. It concluded that ""34 participants in the vaccine group were diagnosed with HIV-1 and 28 in the placebo group. There was no evidence of vaccine efficacy. Vaccine efficacy did not differ by sex, age, herpes status or circumcision."" Now, all eyes are on two discoveries that were made in 2009. First, there were two powerful new antibodies that neutralized all major forms of the virus from the body of an African man. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. These two antibodies were also found to target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate — a defense mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines. Experts are looking at exactly where the antibodies bind to the virus. This will tell them which part of the virus to target with vaccines. Researchers believe they can create an effective vaccine if they are able to get the human body to produce such neutralizing antibodies before exposure to HIV. Scientists are looking at a trial of a Thai HIV vaccine, which in 2009 successfully had cut the risk of HIV infection in humans by 31%. In the largest human trial of an AIDS vaccine — involving more than 16,000 volunteers in Thailand — scientists found that HIV infections were prevented in over a third of the 8,000 volunteers, who received the vaccine. Since HIV was first identified in 1981, 40 millions have been infected with the virus. Annually, an estimated four million new infections occur, of which 90% are in developing countries. AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives over the past 25 years. A vaccine will be a boon for India, where 1.2 lakh new people got infected with the virus in 2009. India, saddled with with 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria as far as HIV burden is concerned. "

Police claim there at least 400 more ‘sex parlours’ operating in the city and their licenses can be cancelled once these are tracked down. Besides duping people, these parlours can trigger the spread of HIV, said a police officer officer. Delhi AIDS Control Society officials said approximately 22 per cent massage parlours in the city are potential hotbeds for HIV transmission. “We were getting frequent complaints from NGOs about such parlours and decided to investigate. We will now request National AIDS Control Organisation, Delhi police and the government to take swift action and sift fake parlours from genuine ones,’’ said a senior official. “Most victims do not lodge complaints as they fear social ostracization. Parlour owners too change their phone numbers frequently and they keep shifting shop from one rented premise to another. We will now take a more holistic approach to the problem,’’ said a police officer. The crime branch is now scanning bank details of the accused, Rajesh Singh, in the fake friendship club racket. Police are also trying to establish if similar fake clubs are being run in other parts of the country. Singh is on the run and police suspect he could be operating more such clubs and masseur centres from other areas of west Delhi like Vikaspuri. “If we find the gang was operating across the city and the country, we could charge them under MCOCA,” said a police officer. Police said this particular gang had been operating the racket for the past one year and was making over Rs 1.5 lakh every day by duping callers. The crime branch had on Saturday busted this gang in Janakpuri and arrested 25 people, including 20 women. Police said Singh was paying about Rs 75,000 rent every month for three offices in Janakpuri and had cheated people in several states, including, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In the case of friendship clubs, the caller would be asked to get himself registered by depositing Rs 1,000 in a bank account. Once the caller registers himself, he would be offered three categories of women contacts for being friends — models for Rs 7,000, college girls for Rs 5,000 and housewives for Rs 3,000. Once the amount was transferred by the caller, Singh would withdraw it using ATM cards and the women would stop taking the calls. For masseur training centres, they only entertained male callers. “They would be told that they would not only teach them how to become a masseur, but also provide a list of clients. The callers would be asked to pay Rs 1,000 as registration fee, Rs 3,750 for the massage kit and Rs 7,000 for the lady trainer,” said Chand. "

The groom, who now runs a dhaba at his village, said, ""After finding out about my HIV status I had left home fearing stigma and rejection. But then, I liked the idea of getting married. That is why I returned home and started a dhaba to support my would be wife."" KNP+ president Prabhasini Pradhan said the major focus of the support group was facilitating the marriage of HIV infected people and giving them a new lease of life. ""We have been functioning like a marriage bureau to facilitate bride and groom hunting among the positive people,"" she said. Pradhan said KNP+ had arranged a meeting between the family members of a Titilagarh youth with that of a widow in Puri recently. ""Both families are very keen about the marriage prospects though they are from different castes,"" Pradhan said. While the prospective groom is a businessman, the Puri woman was widowed four months after her marriage to a driver, she said.According to the Orissa State AIDS Control Society, Orissa has over 20,000 confirmed cases of HIV positive people, including around 1500 AIDS patients, as on March 31.The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has estimated that the prevalence of HIV in the state rose from 0.25 in 2000 to 0.29 per cent in 2009.

64,5,2011,‘Congress grass’ to help fight HIV virus,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/Congress-grass-to-help-fight-HIV-virus/articleshow/8635898.cms," ALLAHABAD: The obnoxious weed Parthenium, popularly known as Congress grass, can help in fighting the virus causing HIV-I, claims a study done at the Allahabad University. Vyom Parashar, a research scholar at AU, has developed a method to transform the extract of the weed of Congress grass into silver nanoparticles which may kill different microbes. Silver nanoparticles are the metal of choice as they hold the promise to kill microbes effectively as these microbes generally have a harder time developing resistance to silver than they do to antibiotics, said Vyom, a research scholar under Prof Avinash C Pandey. His finding has been published in Digest Journal of Nanomaterials and Biostructure besides getting a mention in 14 researches done worldwide. Further, Vyom has been asked by Elsevier, a reputed science journal, to write a book and a chapter on usage of biotechnology in the field of nanoscience. Giving more details, Vyom said, “The methodology of converting the leaf of this weed is simple. The extract of the leaf is added to a solution of silver nitrate and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles. Since, the method used for synthesis of these nanoparticles does not use any added chemicals, it is a cost effective and environmental friendly method.” Congress grass was introduced in India in 1956. It causes contact dermatitis in livestock and is reported to be poisonous to sheep. Humans too are affected by this weed with respiratory malfunction and dermatitis. He said the congress grass would make the farmers reap huge profits as the cost of synthesising one litre of silver nanoparticle is around just Rs 30 whereas the end product can fetch upto Rs 3.5 lakh in the international market. About the methodology, Vyom explained that leaves of congress grass were thoroughly washed thrice in distilled water for 15 min, dried, cut into fine pieces and were boiled with 100 ml of sterile distilled water up to 5 min and were filtered. A team of scientist from various universities of US, including the department of chemical engineering, University of Texas, have reported that silver nanoparticles interact with HIV-1 virus which inhibit the virus from binding to its host cells. Parthenium is responsible for the largest number of skin inflammation cases caused by contact with the plants surface, said Vyom. “I experimented with carrot grass as the pollen grains cause diseases like eczema, asthma and dermatitis.” he added.

65,5,2011,340 HIV positive prisoners in Tihar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/340-HIV-positive-prisoners-in-Tihar/articleshow/8650866.cms," NEW DELHI: It might come as a shock but Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) figures have revealed that there are 340 HIV positive prisoners in Tihar jail, South Asia’s biggest prison. The statistics show that most of the prisoners among these 340 HIV positive prisoners are intravenous drug users. These prisoners are getting free treatment from jail authorities under the de-addition programme called OST (Opioid Substitution Treatment). Jail sources said that prisoners did not know about their HIV status earlier and when they came to know about such programme in Tihar, they joined the centre. Officials say six to eight percent population of Tihar is HIV positive, but it is a fluctuating figure. “Presently, there are 11,800 prisoners in Tihar and this number keeps on fluctuating. So, HIV positive prisoners’ status is also variable because people come and go and they get treatment while being lodged here. All those at the centre have benefited,” said Sunil Gupta, Tihar spokesperson. In the last three years, around 5,700 prisoners, who have taken drugs at least once in life, have undergone tests at this centre. Before June 2008 Tihar jail had no mechanism to identify the HIV positive inmates and whenever any government agency of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) asked the authorities, a rough figure was provided. In June 2008, Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre was opened at Tihar with the help of NACO. Sunil Gupta said that they have been able to identify such large number of HIV positive prisoners inside only through ICTC and they all were affected with it before they came here. Officials said that out of 340 prisoners, 210 are intravenous drug users who have once in their life used injections to consume drugs and they have been repeat offenders in drug abuse. He added that medicines under the treatment of HIV positive are very costly and jail authorities provide these medicines for free to the affected inmates apart from counseling. Earlier, authorities used to send the suspected HIV positive prisoners to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital for treatment but ICTC is located in jail itself with dedicated counselors. The centre provides treatment with the help of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), NGOs and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Gupta said they are providing this treatment to all identified HIV positive inmates so that they don’t spread this disease when they are released on bail. Officials said that Tihar is also the only jail in India which is providing OST treatment to prisoners who are drug addicts and could be affected with HIV. "

The court also ordered notice to health and educational departments on the PIL filed by K Radhakrishnan of Chengalpet. In his petition, Radhakrishnan said he got information during September last year from an orphanage in Cheyyur taluk that 29 children of their home, who were studying at the Panchayat union middle school in Perunkaranai, were expelled since they were affected by HIV. Stating that he himself was an HIV-affected person, the petitioner said his inquiries revealed that the school had sent out the children due to the fear that other students could also get affected by HIV. He had approached the school authorities and explained to them that HIV-infected children cause no risk to others as HIV does not spread through sharing things, spitting or urine, the petitioner said. The school headmaster got convinced and assured that the children could attend the class after mid-term holidays. But, the children were not allowed after the holidays and hence the petitioner approached the school authorities again. They told him that they couldn't take back the students as the local panchayat and parents of the students did not want the 29 children to continue their education in the school. Radhakrishnan further said he had also approached the district education officer and the Tamil Nadu AIDS control society and urged them to take steps to enable the children continue their schooling. Stating that the children had the right to have free and compulsory education and refusal of education to them was a violation of fundamental right, Radhakrishnan said there was an immediate need to protect the aggrieved students from being discriminated and isolated and to enable them continue their education.

67,6,2011,Nursing institute for HIV patients remains a non-starter,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Nursing-institute-for-HIV-patients-remains-a-non-starter/articleshow/8685472.cms," CHENNAI: More than two years after the foundation stone was laid, the city's first post-graduate nursing institute dedicated to treating HIV+ patients in Tambaram remains a non-starter due to shortage of funds. On November 1, 2008, the then union minister for health and family welfare, Anbumani Ramdoss, laid the foundation stone for the Rs 28 crore-Indian Institute of Advanced Nursing at Tambaram Sanatorium. Little work has happened since then. ""As many organisations, both public and private, are involved, mobilisation of funds and co-ordination between different organisations have been challenges in executing the project,"" sources in the state health department told The Times Of India. The nursing institute a unique public-private partnership venture with state-of-the-art facilities was dedicated to train nurses providing healthcare to HIV+ve patients in the country. A joint venture of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS), Indian Nursing Council, William J Clinton Foundation and Yale University, the institute was slated to come up on a five-acre plot near the National Institute of Siddha at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM). The idea to set up such an institute, according to sources, was that the GHTM is not only a centre of excellence for treating HIV+ve persons in the country but is also the largest hospital in giving treatment for these patients in the country. At present, the hospital gives treatment for around 4,000 HIV+ve persons. ""The institute was also aimed to act as a national hub for nursing, research and training in HIV/AIDS-related cases,"" sources added. As per plan, the union health ministry has given Rs 5 crore as seed money for the Rs 28-crore project. The Clinton Foundation is responsible for raising the rest of the funds, and Yale University will provide expertise in training. On its part, the state government through TANSACS has given the land for the institute. The feasibility study for the project was done in 2006 by the Union health ministry through NACO. At present, the state has around 10% of the total HIV affected persons in the country and ranks fourth after Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. There is a shortage of 15 lakh nurses in the public health sector in India. During the 11th Plan, the Centre had allotted Rs. 3,900 crore to the nursing sector alone for building human resources, expanding infrastructure and creating four centres of excellence in Chennai, New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkatta. In Tamil Nadu, the state government had granted permission to the private sector for starting 50 nursing schools and colleges. "
68,6,2011,17 inmates of Manipur prison test HIV positive,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/17-inmates-of-Manipur-prison-test-HIV-positive/articleshow/8701349.cms," IMPHAL: At least 17 inmates of Central Sajiwa Jail in Imphal East have tested HIV positive, forcing the authorities concerned and NGOs to step up their campaign to combat the menace. With hardly 0.2 per cent of India's population, Manipur contributes nearly 8 per cent of the country's total HIV cases. According to the latest epidemiological study of the Manipur State Aids Control Society (Macs), there are 38,016 HIV positive people and 10,109 are women and 2578 children. Besides, 9,985 are undergoing anti-retroviral therapy (ART). A doctor, who is in-charge of therapy and counseling of jail inmates under the project, said 38 blood samples were collected for testing after carrying out counseling of prisoners. He added that tattooing inside the jail has been banned following detection of the HIV positive cases. On World AIDS Day (December 1) last year, governor Gurbachan Jagat launched an AIDS intervention programme in Sajiwa jail following which counselling, testing and awareness camps have been introduced. The project has been taken up as a joint initiative of Macs, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNO-DC) and the jail authorities with Manipur Network of Positive People (MNP+) as the implementing agency, a source said. He added that about 600 inmates are in the jail. On Thursday, a joint team of officials, including Macs project director PK Jha , UNODC regional expert Gunasekhar and SP (Jail) Themthing visited Sajiwa jail to scrutinize the progress of the programme. Of the 17 inmates who have tested HIV positive, five are undergoing anti-retroviral therapy at the state-run Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital here. The process is on for CD4 count of ten others. A source said all 17 inmates had unprotected sex prior to their entry to jail. Key functionaries of MNP+ said proper counselling of the inmates by psychiatrists is the need of the hour as majority of them are suffering from depression, anxiety and other mental health-related problems. The functionaries have been carrying out counselling in Sajiwa jail thrice a week. PK Jha said an ART link would be opened inside the jail shortly and training would be imparted to jail staff and security personnel. On Sunday, a constituency level convention on HIV/AIDS cum health camp was held in the remote Maram Bazaar in Senapati district. "
69,6,2011,Rate of new HIV infections fell by over 50% in India: UNAIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Rate-of-new-HIV-infections-fell-by-over-50-in-India-UNAIDS/articleshow/8713335.cms," NEW DELHI: The rate of new HIV infections fell by more than 50 per cent in India between 2001 and 2009, double of the average decline in the world, according to a new report released on Friday by UNAIDS which said the global response to AIDS is showing results. ""In India, the rate of new HIV infections fell by more than 50 per cent and in South Africa by more than 35 per cent; both countries have the largest number of people living with HIV on their continents,"" according to 'AIDS at 30: Nations at the Crossroads' study. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) report said the global rate of new HIV infections declined by nearly 25 per cent between 2001 and 2009. As the world marks 30 years of AIDS, UNAIDS estimates about 34 million people are living with HIV and nearly 30 million people have died of AIDS-related causes since the first case of AIDS was reported on June 5, 1981. It said about 6.6 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy in low and middle-income countries at the end of 2010, a nearly 22-fold increase since 2001. A record 1.4 million people started life-saving treatment in 2010 -- more than any year before. According to the report, at least 4,20,000 children were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of 2010, a more than 50 per cent increase since 2008. ""Access to treatment will transform the AIDS response in the next decade. We must invest in accelerating access and finding new treatment options,"" said Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS executive director. The report found that in the third decade of the epidemic, people were starting to adopt safer sexual behaviours, reflecting the impact of HIV prevention and awareness efforts. However, there are still important gaps. Young men are more likely to be informed about HIV prevention than young women. Recent demographic health surveys found that an estimated 74 per cent of young men know that condoms are effective in preventing HIV infection, compared to just 49 per cent of young women. In recent years, there has been significant progress in preventing new HIV infections among children as increasing numbers of pregnant women living with HIV have gained access to antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The number of children newly infected with HIV in 2009 was 26 per cent lower than in 2001. About 115 low and middle-income countries are providing optimal treatment regimens for pregnant women living with HIV as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The report, however, said despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy, a major treatment gap remains. At the end of 2010, nine million people who were eligible for treatment did not have access. Treatment access for children is lower than for adults. While the rate of new HIV infections has declined globally, the total number of HIV infections remains high, at about 7000 per day. The global reduction in the rate of new HIV infections hides regional variations. According to the report, above-average declines in new HIV infections were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and in South-East Asia, while Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more modest reductions of less than 25 per cent. There has been an increase in rate of new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East and North Africa. According to the report, gender inequalities remain a major barrier to effective HIV responses. HIV is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, and more than a quarter (26 per cent) of all new global HIV infections are among young women aged 15-24. "

Some 30 HIV affected students, including 13 girls, studying between class 3 and 8 in Chitamur Panchayat Union Middle School have been forced to stay away from the school since September 2010. The students had been going to the school in Perunkaranai since 2008, but their HIV status was largely unknown except to the school principal and the village panchayat president. “Some parents came to know about the children’s status through some teachers who were coming from the city last year, and raised the issue at the PTA meetings. They felt uneasy in sending their wards where some children are infected with HIV,” said K Panchanathan, head master, Chitamur Panchayat Union Middle School. The students are under the care of an NGO Arias Home of Hope. Before admitting them to the school in 2008, Arias Home had told the principal of the school about the children being HIV positive. The panchayat president also knew. The principal and the president had thought it better to not discuss the children’s health situation with others. But word got around. Rumours started spreading about HIV in the village. Some came to believe that the infection could spread through water, sharing food and urinals. “Many villagers did not want these children sharing space with other normal students. We were unable to convince them,” P S Elappan, president, Perunkkaranai village, one of the 42 villages in Chitamur Panchayat Union, in Kancheepuram, told The Times Of India. The children are undergoing free Anti Retro Viral Therapy (ART) at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM) in Tambaram Sanatorium. The NGO activists are taking classes for these students on their own under the Sarva Sisyan Abhiyan’s (SSA) Education For All scheme, which aims to provide education mainly for school dropouts. The NGO cites distance between the school and the home as a reason to withdraw the students from the panchayan union school. “Distance between the school and our home is around two kms and our children had to miss ART on many occasions as they found it difficult to come home during lunch and get ART and return to school again. I can’t say anything more as the issue is in the court,” Pannerselvam, program manager, Arias Home of Hope, told TOI. On May 30 this year, the Madras high court ordered notice to the school on a public interest litigation relating to this issue. The court also ordered notice to health and educational departments on the PIL filed by K Radhakrishnan of Chengalpet. The petitioner Radhakrishnan, who himself is an HIV-affected person, said that the children had the right to have free and compulsory education and refusal of education to them was a violation of fundamental right.

Primary investigation revealed that the sisters received the infection from their parents and took the extreme step due to the social stigma attached with the disease, police said. They further said that their father Vinubha Gohel (42) was bed-ridden and battling for life due to HIV, while their mother and brother succumbed to the disease a couple of years ago. A complaint has been registered and further investigations are on, they added. "

Despite this, only 15% of the pregnant women received HIV test in 2010-11 to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child. The rest did not undergo the test due to social reasons. A survey conducted by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) shows that around 20 lakh women become pregnant in the state but only 15% of them receive HIV test. Around 3.02 lakh pregnant women took HIV test in the state out of which 362 women were tested positive, the survey shows. The state government in cooperation with the RSACS has provided various facilities under prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT), including free HIV test for pregnant women, counseling on antenatal care and sexually transmitted disease, providing nevirapine prophylaxis to mother and child for reducing HIV transmission from mother to child. Information, education and communication (IEC) joint director Pradeep Chaudhary, said, ""We cannot force pregnant women for HIV test as it is against human rights. But we try to persuade them to go for the test as it beneficial for their children. If pregnant women tested are positive, we try to reduce the chance of transmission of HIV to her child by up to 4% by giving nevirapine prophylaxis. A dose of navirapine is given to the mother at a time of delivery to prevent HIV transmission to the child."" The state government aims that all pregnant women should undergo the test. Chaudhary said, ""There are some social reasons which desist pregnant women from undergoing the test."" The state government has taken new initiatives which include opening of community-based HIV screening of pregnant women by Auxiliary Nursing and Midwifery (ANM) at sub-centre level of A and B category districts like Ajmer, Alwar, Barmer, Ganganagar, Jaipur, Tonk and Udaipur. Also, the state government has opened 11 ICTCs which provide HIV DNA PCR test for early diagnosis of HIV infection in a child. But the positive sign is that pregnant women going for HIV test are increasing every year. In 2005-06 the figure was 2,771, in 2006-07 it increased to 19,037, in 2007-08 it was 89,150, in 2008-09 it was 1,40,429 and it was 2,52,591 in 2009-10. "

Fernandes narrated the story of a young son of a judge in Delhi, who was affected with HIV and had come to his house for his support as his parents had expelled him from their house. The public representatives spoke on dignity, support and acceptance of people living with AIDS. Member of Parliament and Representative from the Parliamentary Forum for HIV/AIDS, J D Seelam, said, “I don’t want to debate whether pre-marital sex is right or wrong but it is true that it is increasing. Elders must talk about AIDS and should not shy away.” The number of people living with AIDS has increased in the state to over 76,000. Rajasthan State Legislatures' Forum on HIV/AIDS president and MLA Alauddin Azad, said, “Youths are the future of the country. They should be educated properly on AIDS and public representatives should spread the message in their constituencies.” He gave figures of people living with AIDS in South Africa. He said, “In South Africa, the situation is grim as 30% of the population is affected with AIDS. Also, figures in America are not encouraging.” The public representatives said around 25,000 truckers pass through the state daily and which is also one of the biggest reason for the spread of the disease. Besides, there are 5 lakh labourers in the state. Vidhan Sabha speaker Deependra Singh Shekhawat, who constituted the Rajasthan legislators forum on HIV/AIDS, said, “We are responsible for spread of AIDS as it is not a disease caused by food. It spreads because of our carelessness.” Health minister A A Khan said the Janani Suraksha Yojna (JSY) plays a key role in reducing the number of people living with AIDS. “JSY encourage institutional deliveries. When a pregnant woman comes to hospital for institutional delivery, the hospital conducts a test for HIV/AIDS. If the woman is tested positive, the hospital administer medicines which reduces the chances of transmission of HIV from mother to child.” The officials of the medical and health department gave figures of people living with AIDS, challenges in uprooting the disease, precautions and reasons for its spread.

77,6,2011,Man kills 'HIV positive' wife,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/Man-kills-HIV-positive-wife/articleshow/8753737.cms," IMPHAL: Amid contradictory claims, a woman in Imphal was killed by her husband for not disclosing to him that she was HIV positive. A large number of NGOs strongly reacted against the unprecedented homicide. This comes at a time when government agencies and NGOs have intensified their ongoing awareness programme on HIV/AIDS. Truck driver M Ibomcha confessed that he, in a fit of rage, had strangulated his wife, Rasheshori (33), on Thursday night, after coming to know that she was living with HIV/AIDS. A resident of Yainganagpokpi, Ibomcha has been living at his wife's native village, Saijang in Imphal East, for the last few years. He said Rasheshori was married to another man before him and she had two children from her first marriage. He added her first husband died of AIDS. Notwithstanding Ibomcha's allegations, there has been no official confirmation that the deceased woman had contracted the dreaded virus. Incidentally, Rasheshori was Ibomcha's second wife as he was separated from his first wife; he has five children from his first marriage. Despite Ibomcha's confession, Sagang locals strongly feel Rasheshori was killed by her own brother, Milan, over a land issue. Ibomcha is currently lodged in the custody of the Lamlai police station. He said his wife never disclosed that she was HIV positive though they were married for four years. He added she had a child in the marriage, but it died when it was just four months old, driving Ibomcha to become suspicious about his wife's health condition. Ibomcha said he recently found Rasheshori's medical reports and as he can't read, he asked a local person to go through them and got to know that his wife was HIV positive. Since his discovery, he was living with the dreaded apprehension that he, too, must have contracted the deadly virus from her, Ibomcha added. He revealed he had a heated argument on the matter with Rasheshori on Thursday night. Ibomcha claimed his pent-up anger gave way to violence and he strangulated her; he also disclosed he was drunk at the time. The local 'meira paibis' (women's vigil groups) and clubs, however, alleged that Rasheshori was killed by her brother Milan due to his greed for the plot of land occupied by his brother-in-law and sister. They said they'd frequently witnessed Milan bashing up his sister for the same. "
78,6,2011,Study reveals state in HIV grip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Study-reveals-state-in-HIV-grip/articleshow/8795058.cms," KOLKATA: Unicef, in association with Bengal Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (BNP), has conducted a mapping of HIV positive children in the state. According to the study, a whopping 83% of the children covered inherited the deadly disease from their mothers while the rest were infected through blood transfusion. ""There is a need to prevent transmission of HIV from mother with appropriate intervention. Our focus should be to reach out to the unreachable so that the follow up is universal,"" said Dr Ivonne Camaroni of Unicef India's chief HIV section. The two-year study covered 18 districts across the state and mapped 1,639 children from 995 families where either of the parents or both are HIV positive. Of them, 857 children were found infected with the virus. North 24-Parganas topped the list with 124 infected children, followed by South 24-Parganas, with 78 children, while 72 were traced in Kolkata. As many as 65% of the mothers covered in the study did not receive prevention on parent-to-child transmission services during their late stages of pregnancy. Only 16% of the infected children are on anti-retroviral treatment while 75% of them live in areas from where they have to travel at least 100 kilometres to access healthcare facilities. Since about 72% of the families fall under the below poverty line category, most are unable to travel that far to avail the facilities. ""The report's findings give us a glimpse into the harsh reality faced by children and families living with HIV/AIDS,"" said Lori Calvo, Unicef West Bengal chief. The mapping, however, covered only children of parents who are members of HIV positive network. According to West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS), the state has about 1500 HIV positive children. ""This is only an estimate and does not reflect the exact figure. Despite efforts to eliminate new infection to children, there have been challenges,"" said WBSACPS project director Dr RK Vats. The report of the study was released during a state consultation on children living with HIV, organized by Unicef in association with WBSACPS. "
79,6,2011,HIV menace in Hazaribag,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/HIV-menace-in-Hazaribag/articleshow/8880074.cms," HAZARIBAG: Since 2001, the Hazaribag circle, which includes the districts of Koderma, Chatra, Palamu and Giridih, has witnessed 229 HIV deaths and the state has recorded 435 deaths caused by this deadly virus during the same period, according to Aradhna Patnaik, mission director, National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and project director of the Jharkhand State AIDS Control Society (JSACS). A technical team from the JSACS took samples from the people of 5,480 families of the Bishnugarh block of Hazaribag between April 2008 and May 2011, and found as many as 266 people were infected with the virus. Patnaik said under the annual surveillance conducted by the Union health ministry, Bishungarh block of Hazaribag was identified as a high risk group site and widespread survey was conducted by the society. Given the startling figures, the JSACS has opened a special cell on the block hospital premises to test blood samples and also to create awareness among people against HIV and its prevention. A large number of residents of this block, mostly drivers and labourers, migrate to big cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad and its surrounding areas in search of employment. Normally, the labourers keep their families in their native places and develop unprotected sexual relationship with women suffering from HIV. When they come home during festivals and cultivation time, infect their wives vis-a-vis families with the virus. Residents said the number of deaths were higher than the official figures as the JSACS team has not visited many remote and Maoistprone areas like Kargalo, Purnata, Telanidah Saapmar More in Narki Panchayat. ""Out of over 5,000 samples collected from the Bishnugarh block, as many as 266 were found positive, responding to which a cell has been established in which counsellors and technical staff have been deputed,"" she added. However, the appointment of a woman counsellor remains on paper only. Though a counselling centre was opened here in 2008, till now not a single counsellor has remained on the post for the past three years. Since the counsellors are sent from Ranchi, the post continues to be vacant. ""There is a need to appoint a local counsellor who can spread awareness in villages,"" said Dr A P Singh at the Hazaribagh Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre. "
80,6,2011,Cop bid to tackle HIV/AIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Cop-bid-to-tackle-HIV/AIDS/articleshow/8919977.cms," JAIPUR: The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) has started a programme to sensitise policemen against taking punitive action against sex workers as it would result in them moving to more places, further spreading the disease. If the sex workers are scattered to more places, it would become difficult for RSACS to trace them and provide treatment for HIV/AIDS. Hence, the RSACS has sought the help of the state police in fighting HIV/AIDS. The NGO has started training 1,400 state police officials to spread the message to 80,000 policemen. The state police have decided to include the programme in their training curriculum. Additional director general of police (training) Sudhir Pratap Singh said, “We want our policemen well informed about HIV/AIDS. Such training would not only educate our policemen but would also make others aware of it. So we have decided to include it in our curriculum.” The society has been training police instructors for the past two months. It has plans to initiate trainint at all the seven police training centres which include Rajasthan Police Academy in Jaipur, Police Motor Driving School in Bikaner, police training schools in Kherwara (Udaipur), Kishangarh and Jhalawar. Also, they would provide training at Rajasthan Police Training Centre and police training school in Jodhpur. Director, AIDS project Dr Pradeep Kumar Sarda said, “The female sex workers are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Due to strict police action, the sex workers move to other places. This increases the risk of spreading of virus to other places. So now we have got the support of the police and we are jointly trying to uproot HIV/AIDS in the state.” This is for the first time that the police of the state are being sensitised about HIV/AIDS in such a large scale. RSACS project officer Ashish Verma said, “So far, we have provided training to more than 400 policemen. By August, we plan to train 1,400. They will train 80,000 policemen of the state.” He said the Centre has directed that the National AIDS control programme should not only be the responsibility of the health department but that of all government departments.

Durga, a native of Baddhaiya area of Sultanpur got HIV infection after she administered infected blood, the source of which could not be ascertained so far. Taking a note of this, chief medical officer (CMO), Dr J L Mishra constituted a probe in the case. The committee however could not scan the records of government blood bank, the only blood bank in Sultanpur. “The team was busy checking details and records of the nursing homes in question,” said Dr Mishra adding that the final report is expected by Wednesday. The officer agreed that there was no other source for blood units in the city. So, why is the probe team focusing on nursing homes and not the blood bank? Answering this he said, “We are trying to get details from all the ends and nursing homes are a crucial link.” Meanwhile, show cause notices were issued to private nursing homes, where Durga was admitted. Citing preliminary report, he said that the nursing homes were not keeping proper records. Besides this, name of doctors mentioned on admission ticket were not present. They also found that Durga was not attended by a female doctor which is another violation of the laid down rules. “Procedural irregularities at the nursing homes have made it difficult to trace the source of blood transfused to the patient.” The CMO has also written to the anti retroviral therapy centre at Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU) to find out the possibilities of getting HIV infection from contaminated blood or blood products. Head of the ART centre, Prof AK Tripathi in this regard said, “Transfusing contaminated blood means 100 % chances of getting the infection. Presence of the virus can be confirmed from the lymph nodes with 4-5 hours and from the blood stream in 3-4 days.” Durga was first admitted to Vandana nursing home on June 2, where doctors told her husband to arrange two units of blood. She was then given three units of blood at Allied Nursing Home on June 6. HIV infection was confirmed at Astha Nursing Home, which referred her to government women’s hospital. Doctors at government women hospital confirmed that Durga had HIV. "
82,6,2011,HIV study reveals double jeopardy,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/HIV-study-reveals-double-jeopardy/articleshow/8970924.cms," MUMBAI: The clever HIV virus could be present in drastically different variants in the bodily fluids—blood and semen—of the same individual. This was recently established by a study of 12 HIV-infected men whose blood and semen samples were analyzed by Parel's National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH). The finding is significant, said scientists of NIRRH, as it negates the notion that an infected person can go slow on treatment or think of starting a family once the viral load in the bloodstream becomes undetectable . The study clearly established that the type and behaviour of the HIV virus present in the bloodstream of an infected individual could be drastically different from the type and behaviour of the virus present in the same individual's semen. In certain cases, it could look as if the individual is infected with two different types of virus altogether. The pathbreaking HIV study, carried out by NIRRH in collaboration with the JJ Hospital's medicine department, was recently published in the Journal of Medical Virology. Principal investigator Dr A H Bandivadekar told TOI that the study proves that the virus could disappear from the blood stream due to anti-retroviral therapy but still be very much present in the semen . ""This difference in the virus nature influences the transmission of HIV, the progression of the ailment , the virus' response to the host defence and also treatment,"" he added. Further, Bandivadekar added that the study pointed out that sperm-associated virus too is a huge risk factor for HIV transmission and possibly for parent child transmission. ""Therefore, assisted reproductive technology where sperm washing is used may not be termed as a completely safe procedure for maternal or fetal transmission of HIV,"" he said. The study further adds to the intriguing nature of the virus as it adds to the unpredictability, given its nature of constant mutation. In several of the individuals studied, the viral count in the blood differed vastly from the count in semen. For instance, while the blood plasma in one individual had 11,284 copies of the virus, the viral presence in his semen was around 5,432 copies. Also ,in two individuals, the virus load in the blood had gone below detectable levels, but there were significant quantities of the virus present in the semen. Simply put, the virus in the blood and semen infect the same individual in different ways. Head of JJ Hospital's ART centre and one of the investigators, Dr Alka Deshpande, said the study also means that those on anti-retroviral medication should not think that it could keep the virus in both the compartments, blood and semen, under control. ""It is now clear that there could be genetic differences in virus even if they are present in the same individual's body,"" she added. ""It only means that whenever a vaccine or drug is created, the variant nature of the virus has to be kept in mind so that it can attack all compartments,"" she added. "

On Monday, Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh officially called for linking the country's HIV programmes and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme to help HIV patients get employment. In India, social stigma against HIV patients is tremendous, making it hard for the afflicted to get work. Urging ministries to have a ""HIV sensitive"" policy and programmes so that the marginalized populations infected and affected by HIV/AIDS are not denied the benefits of these schemes, Singh, while inaugurating the national convention of zilla parishad and mayors on HIV/AIDS, said, ""We have to ensure that there is no stigma and discrimination towards HIV infected and affected persons. No child should be denied admission in schools and colleges because he or she is afflicted with HIV or because his or her parents are afflicted with this disease."" He added, ""We must ensure that no person loses his or her employment because of HIV. We must see that there is no social ostracization. We should ensure that women are not doubly stigmatized."" Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad too stressed on ending stigma against HIV patients. Azad said ""stigma associated with HIV/AIDS is a barrier for accessing services and also pushes the epidemic underground. We are committed to fight this stigma so that people living with HIV can live lives of dignity and get access to education, employment as well as health care without discrimination."" Azad said the government recently adopted a national policy to ensure a stigma-free environment in workplaces and enhance linkages to services. India is estimated to have nearly 24 lakh HIV patients. Though the adult prevalence is just 0.31%, the nation has the third highest burden of HIV, next to South Africa and Nigeria in terms of the number of people infected. The number of new HIV infections in India has come down to 1.2 lakhs annually as compared to 2.7 lakhs in 2000. ""This means that in the last decade we have brought down the new infections by half,"" the minister added. One area of concern, according to Azad, is the prevention of transmission of HIV infection from infected mother to child. ""Since this is a preventable phenomenon, we have to work towards elimination of this mode of transmission. However, there are major challenges in reaching out to all pregnant women for ensuring institutional deliveries for all the 27 million pregnancies that happen annually,"" he said. He added, ""To meet this challenge, on June 1, 2011, a new initiative called Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) was launched to promote institutional deliveries. Over and above the cash incentives paid for institutional deliveries at government health facilities, this scheme includes free hospitalization, free medicines, free consumables, free diagnostics, free diet (up-to three days in the case of normal delivery and seven days in the case of Caesarean section), free provision of blood and free transport to &amp; fro from home to all pregnant women and their new born."" The minister exuded confidence that the scheme would encourage women to volunteer for HIV testing. "

Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, while meeting a delegation of protestors seeking an early introduction of the HIV/AIDS Bill, refused to make any commitment on when the government would finalize and introduce it in Parliament. According to the delegates, the minister stated that the Bill should not have provisions for free treatment for all HIV patients. The chapter of treatment in the Bill provides for the provision of free of cost treatment to people living with HIV including second-line treatment, opportunistic infections and important diagnostic tests like viral load tests, which continue to be a huge problem. ""The chapter is vital and the government's refusal to include it in the Bill comes as a huge disappointment to people living with HIV,"" the delegates said. Around 200 HIV patients staged a protest in the capital on Monday, demanding that a Bill to protect the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament. At present, the Bill is with the health ministry. In August 2007, the HIV/AIDS Bill, prepared by the health ministry, was sent to the law ministry. In March 2010, the law ministry cleared the Bill. ""Since then, the Bill is pending with the health ministry,"" the protestors said. According to Ram Lakhan of Jagriti Network, ""It seems that the government is sleeping on it. It has been half a decade since the Bill was finalized by the health ministry. However, till date, the Bill has not been tabled in Parliament."" Under the present HIV programme, though government is providing first-line and second-line antiretroviral treatment (ARVs) to people infected with HIV, treatment for opportunistic infections and important diagnostic tests like viral load tests are not available at the government centres. ""The Bill is very important as it puts an obligation on the state to provide complete treatment including ARVs, diagnostics and nutritional supplements to all HIV positive people. However, it seems that this legislation is no more a priority for the government and they are not bothered about the problems faced by the people living with HIV in this country"" said Sahil from Om Prakash Network of Positive People. Jyoti, of the Delhi Positive Women's Network and Mundrika of Delhi Mahila Samiti, said, ""Women are specifically vulnerable to HIV due to their socio-economic status. The Bill aims to tackle this vulnerability by providing special provisions like protocols for sexual assault and right to residence. The Bill needs to be passed in the Parliament without any further delay."" "

It was alleged that she was killed by her trucker husband, M Ibomcha, for keeping her HIV status concealed. On the basis of the allegation, police arrested Ibomcha, a resident of Yainganagpokpi. However, the incident took a new twist with the locals of Sagang claiming that Rasheshori was killed by her brother, Milan, owing to some disputes over land. Following this, activists of NGOs such as MNP+, Women Action for Development and SAATHI on Saturday staged a demonstration at Singjamei Bazaar in the heart of the city, seeking reinvestigation into Rasheshori's murder. They also claimed that Ibomcha had not murdered his wife. tnnThe NGO leaders also said they were mulling to move court to find out who killed Rasheshori's. Holding placards with messages like ""Don't discriminate HIV+ve women and children,"" "" Reinvestigate the murder of Rasheshori"", "" Save the life of HIV-affected orphans"" and ""Ensure the right to health education and shelter to all children infected and affected by HIV/Aids"", the NGO activists said the government must take certain measures for the welfare of Ibomcha's two children. Manipur is among six states in the country which have high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. According to Manipur State AIDS Control Society statistics, Manipur has 38,016 HIV-positive people. Of them, 10,109 are women and 2,578 children. "

As per data released by the Haryana Aids Control Society, people suffering from STD, including women, who tested positive for HIV are largely from Bhiwani, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Ambala districts. People are falling prey to the HIV largely due to drug addiction, multiple use of needles and sexually transmitted disease (STD) infection. However, more cases of HIV positive due to multiple use of needle have been detected in the districts neighboring Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. This has not only exposed the tall claims of the health authorities but also of the state aids control society of having spent crores of rupees on intensified awareness campaigns against HIV. It has also raised questions over the claim of drug control department and police tightening noose around chemists involved in selling of injectable drugs to addicts in Sirsa, Fatehabad, Hisar, Kurukshetra and Ambala belts. “Of course, this is an alarming trend. We are doing our best to bring this under control. As far as HIV positive cases are concerned, drug abuse is the main cause of concern. We are in touch with police to nab errant chemists. At the same time, we have written to food and drug control department to intensify strikes on drug stores to check illegal sale of drugs,’’ said Dr Narveer Singh, director general of health services (DGHS) Haryana, who also holds the charge of project director of Haryana Aids Control Society (HACS). He said for STD cases, they have already roped in an NGO, adding that otherwise, the cities have shown a downward trend in urban areas. When contacted, some of the headmen in rural belts admitted to the loss due to drug addiction and assured of strict measures. “Panchayats do take initiatives. We do not have any such case in our village so far. We are also taking additional measures to prevent HIV from spreading,’’ Jai Singh, former sarpanch of a village in Naraingarh sub-division, Ambala, said. "

OSACS additional project director Dr R K Nath on Tuesday said injecting drug users will get 'buprenorphine,' an oral drug, under medical supervision. This will reduce the risk of HIV transmission through needle-syringe route as those taking the shots tend to share needle and syringe, Dr Nath told TOI. To start with, the AIDS control body will open three opiod substitution therapy (OST) centres, meant to give the oral drugs, in SCB Medical College, Cuttack besides Puri and Bargarh district headquarters hospitals. A doctor, a nurse and an outreach worker will be stationed in each of these centres. The OST centres will also counsel the users to reduce intake of drugs so they can quit gradually. It is easier to quit buprenorphine, a tablet which the users keep below their tongue, Dr Nath said. The three areas were selected in the first phase because of a sizeable number of injecting drug users in these towns, the doctor said. Over 300 persons have been found to habitually inject drugs in Cuttack, 250 in Puri and 250 in Bargarh. The three centres should open by September-October, Nath said. The infrastructure is almost ready except for the Bargarh centre and the OSACS has sent the project proposal to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) for its final approval, the project director said. OSCAS initiated the project after a pilot study in Bhubaneswar though an NGO. Over 75 people have tried the oral alternative in the state capital in the past one year. Currently, OSCAS has also been supplying single-use disposable needle and syringes to around 2,200 drug users in Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Jajpur, Sambalpur, Bargarh and Deogarh to avoid needle sharing among drug addicts. Sources said about 3 % drug users in the injecting category in the state were HIV positive, while among the general population the estimated prevalence of HIV in the state is 0.29 %. As per government figures, the state has 3,117 AIDS patients at present. As many as 3,665 persons tested HIV positive in 2010 compared to 3,819 in 2009. "
90,7,2011,Scientists report breakthrough in reducing risk of acquiring HIV infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Scientists-report-breakthrough-in-reducing-risk-of-acquiring-HIV-infection/articleshow/9218341.cms," NEW DELHI: A single tablet, taken daily by people who do not have HIV infection, can reduce their risk of acquiring HIV by up to 73%. In a major medical breakthrough, scientists from two separate studies conducted in three African countries, on Wednesday reported that anti retroviral pills tenofovir and tenofovir/emtricitabine taken as a prophylactic can prevent heterosexual transmission of HIV from men to women and from women to men. At present, ART is a treatment option for those infected with HIV. Now, the fresh results show that ART could also be used as a preventive tool. The Partners PrEP trial, conducted by the University of Washington's International Clinical Research Center, followed 4,758 sero-discordant couples (in which one person had HIV infection and the other did not) in Kenya and Uganda. Couples received counselling and free male and female condoms. The uninfected partner took a once-daily tenofovir tablet or a tenofovir/emtricitabine tablet or a placebo pill. There were 62% fewer HIV infections in the group receiving tenofovir and 73% fewer HIV infections in the group that took tenofovir/emtricitabine than in the group receiving the placebo. The TDF2 trial, on the other hand, conducted by the United States' Centers for Disease Control, followed 1,200 men and women in Botswana who received either a once-daily tenofovir/emtricitabine tablet or a placebo pill. The ART tablet reduced the risk of acquiring HIV infection by roughly 63% overall in the study population of uninfected heterosexual men and women. UNAIDS chief Michel Sidibé called it a major scientific breakthrough. WHO director-general Dr Margaret Chan, on the other hand, said these studies could have enormous impact in preventing heterosexual transmission. In November 2010, the iPrEx trial among men who have sex with men in six countries reported a 44% reduction in HIV transmission among those who took a daily tenofovir/emtricitabine tablet. Scientists have for long been looking at options of pre-exposure prophylaxis in HIV prevention. ""This news will encourage more people to get tested for HIV, discuss HIV prevention options with their partners and access essential HIV services,"" experts said. WHO and UNAIDS say the medicines used in the trials are available generically in many countries at prices as low as $ 0.25 per tablet. Dr Chan added, ""WHO will be working with countries to use the new findings to protect more men and women from HIV infection."" "

WVI, a Christian humanitarian organization working to bring about changes in the lives of children, families and communities living in poverty, said such people have a very alarming prevalence of Hep-C co-infection with HIV. It said non-prevalence of specific components for women and children till date in the National AIDS Control programme were raised and discussed as a major challenge. WVI's advocacy associate Daisy David added that the rate of Hep-C co-infection with HIV is more than 90 per cent in the northeastern states. During an interactive session with PLHIV and reporters held in Imphal on Wednesday, David said, ""People Living with AIDS are dying of liver complications caused by this co-infection and the side effects of ART. This needs to be addressed by the state offering free PCR testing and treatment for Hep-C co-infection."" The PLHIV activists, during the session, urged the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) to remove the second line ART eligibility procedure from the control of state AIDS clinical expert panel. tnnThey also requested the government to immediately phase out Stavudine (d4T) from the first line regimen and include (TDF) instead in tune with the WHO recommendations. Both WVI and PLHIV batted for children and women-specific diagnosis and easy access to quality care, support and treatment under various social schemes of the government. "

Flanked by a large royal contingent including his mother, who rules alongside him, four of his 13 wives and several children, Africa's last absolute monarch said men and boys needed to get circumcised to help fight the ""terrorist"" virus, which infects one in four adults in the kingdom of nearly 1.2 million. Studies have found men without a foreskin are 60% less likely to get HIV, the virus that can lead to AIDS. ""It seems fitting that our men and young boys should be given an initiative that will help them fight this disease,"" Mswati told a gathering of thousands in the southern town of Mankayane, where he gave his official endorsement to the campaign. ""This virus I shall liken to a terrorist. It is here to finish off our people."" Mswati was entertained by bare-breasted teenage girls, troops of warrior regiments and a military brass band. Urging his nation to ""take care of your lives - stay away from activities that could give you the disease,"" the king struck a very different note from his pronouncement to parliament a decade ago that HIV-positive people should be ""branded and sterilized"". The US-funded circumcision campaign aims to snip 80% of Swazi males aged 14 to 49 within a year. Officials hope to avert 90,000 new infections and save the health system millions of dollars over the next decade. Circumcision used to be widespread in Swaziland, but was abandoned in the 19th century. The king likened the return of the practice to other traditions he revived in 2001 as a solution to the rampant epidemic: requiring young girls to wear tassels to display their virginity and banning men from having sex with girls under 18. When the king broke his own ban by taking a 17-year-old wife, he fined himself a cow. Since the project started six months ago, results have not been encouraging. Only 3,000 have braved the scalpel despite a massive advertising campaign. Organizers are pinning their hopes on Mswati, known to his people as ""the mouth that speaks no lies"", to breathe life into the campaign. "

The sky came crashing down on the couple when on Thursday they applied for the ration card at their native Raghunathpura village under Asind tehsil of Bhilwara district . Not only were they denied the card but they had to leave the village after their HIV status was made public by members of the gram panchayat's card issuing committee. Soon after learning their status, the residents chased them out and asked to stay away from the village. ""The 25-year-old man and his wife were fighting with the disease for the last couple of years, but they faced no problems earlier since not many in their village knew about the HIV status. But on July 21, the secretary of the gram panchayat, after knowing about the health of this family disclosed the fact to the villagers,"" said Bhanwar Lal Jaat, coordinator of Bhilwara Network for Positive People. Jaat said the victims have faxed a letter to the chief ministers ' office seeking intervention into their plight. ""Anyone who discloses the identity of an HIV/AIDS patient is liable to pay a fine up to Rs 1 lakh,"" Jaat said. Facing a social boycott, the family has now moved to Beawar, Ajmer district and is planning to permanently leave the native village. ""The man who earns his livelihood as a cook in weddings and other ceremonies was so disturbed that he with his family moved out of the village. He told us that people including his neighbours have stopped talking to them,"" Jaat said. The youth told TOI, ""I was living happily with my family but somebody advised me to apply for the ration card and I did. For the first time, I experienced what is the meaning of being HIV positive."" "

With participants registering from far off places, including Delhi, the event promises to be much bigger than last year. Though people living with HIV can live a full and healthy life with the help of ART medications, they often have trouble finding partners. As Wake Up Pune coordinator Kassie Dantzler explained, ""not many resources are available to help people with HIV find a spouse. At times, even finding friends or community can be difficult. Wake Up Pune hopes to facilitate new and meaningful relationships for such people."" Based in a belief that all people have the right to get married if they choose to and that people living with HIV need to be supported rather than stigmatised, Meleva+ provides a platform for such people to find a life partner, community, love and happiness. Tackling HIV related stigma and discrimination by supporting the universal right to marriage and happiness, the event provides an opportunity for PLHIV to meet people they can relate to and to build lasting relationships built on mutual care and support. New friendships and relationships will help them become mainstreamed in society and even start thinking about starting a family. The last year's event had 150 candidates and their families from Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat. Twelve couples got engaged at the event. Several of these couples are now expecting babies. One of participants in the last year's event said, ""I was ostracised by society. I just could not think of marriage. However, thanks to this meeting, I found my life partner. The event will be held from 9 am to 5 pm on August 7 at Maulana Abdul Kalam memorial hall in Koregaon Park. Woman participants can be accompanied by two relatives while male participants may bring only one. Travel costs of woman participants will be sponsored as long as proof of travel (for example, a bus or train ticket) is provided. Registrations will be accepted till August 2.

He was said to be depressed over his illness. Doctors said the deceased, a resident of Ghaziabad, was suffering from various diseases, including tuberculosis, meningitis and coughing, and was recently diagnosed with HIV.. In the wee hours of Sunday, he reportedly walked out of his ward under the pretext of going to the restroom and jumped off the seventh floor of Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital.

99,8,2011,"HIV-infected, recycled syringes sting Kolkata",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-infected-recycled-syringes-sting-Kolkata/articleshow/9450716.cms," KOLKATA: It is wobbly with a crooked needle and a depressed piston. The tip looks blunt, the cap is loose and the tube has a pale exterior. ‘For single use only’, says the instruction printed on the syringe but it looks far from a fresh one, safe enough for use. And it is not the only one which doctors at SSKM Hospital in Kolkata suspect to have been recycled from clinical wastes that are routinely dumped in the hospital backyard. Hundreds of syringes, saline bottles, blood bags, slides and other medical equipment — all recycled — are believed to have infiltrated SSKM through a network that has been active for some years. The result could be disastrous and might have started taking effect already, fear doctors. TOI got hold of a syringe bearing lot number 11071 bought by the hospital in June. Tightly wrapped in a transparent packet, it looks like any other syringe. But, the piston is unsteady and loose while the needle is blunt. “It is clear that this is a recycled product and could be carrying deadly germs. Hepatitis B is the most common virus that recycled instruments like these could be carrying. Even HIV can’t be ruled out,” said Rezaul Karim, a senior faculty at the hospital. The recycled syringes are mixed up with new ones in a batch. “It’s a fifty-fifty mix so you don’t know what you are going to get,” said a doctor. Ironically, the genuine ones were priced lower — at Rs 7 per piece — as against the recycled variety that cost Rs 7.10. It’s not just syringes that are being recycled. Slides for collecting blood samples are regularly found to have been used before. The stains on recycled slides are a giveaway but they are not easy to spot. But doctors don’t fail to notice them. “Blood reports are likely to be inaccurate if these slides are used. We often advise patients to get slides from College Street instead of buying them from shops around the hospital,” said Karim. SSKM authorities admit to an inefficient disposal system. The waste is dumped in an open space behind the superintendent’s office and remains uncollected till 11am. “We do try and put them into three separate bags as per the norm. The agency which collects the waste is at fault as well. They don’t collect the waste in time,” said Provash Chakrabarty, medical superintendent of the hospital. The waste is taken to Dhapa where they are sold at slums on the city’s Basanti Expressway and Tangra-Topsia Road, off EM Bypass. Here, the reusable parts are segregated and sent to fringe areas like Mahishbathan, Dum Dum and Garia for cleaning. From there, the recycled wastes make their way to the “manufacturing” units at Burrabazar where they are repackaged and sold back to retailers. "

""We have written to director general police, Punjab to release funds to the tune of Rs 2 lakh per persons infected with hepatitis for their treatment,"" said Dr Sandeep Kakkar, medical officer, Police Lines, Tarn Taran while talking to TOI on Friday. Drug addiction, multiple sexual relations, unsafe sex, quackery and illiteracy were main reason for the spread of the deadly disease among policemen, especially in the low ranks, said Kakkar. Earlier the department had paid for the treatment of 80 policemen infected with hepatitis and they have successfully recovered, he said. Refusing to divulge identity of the infected, he said many policemen never turn up for medical examination due to the social stigma attached to the disease. ""The situation is serious and there is a need for thorough scrutiny so that necessary steps could be taken for prevention as well as cure,"" he said. A Hepatitis C infected cop, on condition of anonymity, revealed that drug abuse was rampant among low ranks of police and many a times a single needle was reused for injecting intoxicants. ""Being an expensive treatment, none of the infected policemen are willing to get medically examined,"" he said. Kakkar said, ""Hepatitis C patients having high viral load were required to take immediate treatment of subcutaneous injections of Viraferon peg 80mg weekly, for six months. The therapy should be supported by capsule Rebavarin 200mg three times daily for six months. This treatment is monitored by series of blood testing and costs approximately Rs 2 lakh."" "

Hospitals, which are supposed to hand them out free, say they don’t have adequate stocks of these medicines. Officials of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), the country’s nodal agency for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, said the sudden increase in the number of patients receiving second-line of treatment has caused the countrywide shortage of these drugs. Healthcare experts and NGOs fear this would increase the number of patients dropping out of the drug regimen, causing more cases of drug resistance. ART is a combination of highly advanced drugs meant to fight HIV infection and increase life expectancy of HIV-AIDS patients. If the first-line of treatment is not adequate to bring down the viral load, patients are given the second-line of drugs. Both these regimens are provided free of cost by NACO. Patients advised to take higher dosage of pediatric drugsIn Tamil Nadu, only two ART centres provide second line of drugs. They are located in Tambaram in Chennai and in Salem city. At least 150 patients from Salem, Krishnagiri, Erode, Namakkal, Karur, Ooty and Coimbatore visit the Salem centre to collect a month’s dosage. For the past one month, patients have been asked to take higher dosage of pediatric drugs or purchase them from the retail market. Second-line ART regimen consists of tenofovir, lamivudin, atazanavir and ritonovir. But ART centre managers say that the NACO has not supplied them with ritonovir. Krishnagiri-based G Karunanidhi, member of Tamilnadu Networking People with HIV/AIDS, is among those prescribed the second line ART medicine. He visits the ART centre every month to collect his monthly quota of drugs. On July 18, the centre gave him medicines for only four days though his usual dosage is for a month. “They asked me to come back to Salem after four days to collect the remaining drugs. I went back on July 25 and I was told they had not received the stock,” he said. P Nagaraj of Salem Network of PLWHA wasn’t as lucky. He was asked to take the pediatric ART drugs. “They told me that I could take double the child’s dose. I avoided it as I feared side effects,” he said. Experts say the drugs may not produce the desired effect unless they are taken at the right time and dosage. Dr Sentha Krishnan, who is in charge of Salem ART centre, said there were no stocks of ritonovir tablets. “We have not received supply of the drugs from NACO since mid-July. We ask patients to take a combination of lopinavir-ritonovir tablets. It has no side effects. NACO has told us the stocks will be replenished in a few days,” she said. NACO's regional co-ordinator SThennarasu said the situation was the same all over the country. NACO's national programme officer (ART) BB Rewari confirmed that the number of persons taking second line ART has increased. “We have added five more centres to give the second line of ART drugs. We are doing our best to give everyone the medicines. Instead of buying from international companies, we are now planning to go in for local pharmaceutical companies,” he said. "

Developed by scientists at the University of Columbia in New York, the mChip, which costs $1 and looks like a credit card, has proved almost 100% accurate in Rwanda. Hundreds of tests using a prototype were carried out in the town of Kigali and returned a 95% accuracy for HIV and 76% for syphilis , the Daily Mail reported. “The idea is to make a large class of diagnostic tests accessible to patients in any setting in the world, rather than forcing them to go to a clinic to draw blood and then wait days for their results,” said professor Samuel Sia, who led the team that developed the device. The mChip uses optics to read fluids by taking a single pin-prick of blood. It contains 10 detection zones which the blood passes through and then returns a positive or negative result in about 15 minutes. The result is presented in a simple colour-coded manner like pregnancy test, making it easy to use and understand "

""We provide the drugs free of cost to around 55 to 60 patients on designated two days in a week. Patients need to take these drugs every day,"" said a staff at the ART centre at BJMC. The hospital had to supply 3,000 tablets of retonovir, a second line ART drug, to a government medical college in Bangalore a few days ago and the supplied number of tablets were not replenished in time, resulting in short-supply, said the staff. As a result, patients visiting the centre have been going empty-handed. ""The shortage has forced us to buy the medicine in the open market. These drugs are very expensive.

104,8,2011,San Francisco slashes HIV prevention budget for Asian Americans,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//nri/us-canada-news/San-Francisco-slashes-HIV-prevention-budget-for-Asian-Americans/articleshow/9541092.cms," SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. : The San Francisco Department of Public Health is drastically cutting funding for HIV treatment and prevention in the Asian American Pacific Islander community and has allocated no money to stem the spread of the virus in Asian American women whose rates of HIV infections are on the rise. Over the past four years, Asian Americans have had the highest increase in new HIV infections, going up from six percent to 10.3 percent. ""Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the HIV infection rate in A&amp;PI communities will surpass that of Latinos by 2015 and of African Americans by 2020 if left unchecked,"" said Tri Do, an assistant adjunct professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, in an earlier story. Only 10 percent of API men and less than one percent of Asian American women have been tested for the HIV virus. San Francisco annually awards $9.7 million in funding to organizations within the city that work on HIV treatment and prevention. But the city is rolling out a new plan for prevention – known as New Directions – which primarily funds organizations working with Caucasian, African American and Latino gay men, according to API community advocates. ""Trikone is saddened by the San Francisco Public Health Department's decision to slash funding for HIV/AIDS programs affecting the API community,"" Harsha Mallajosyula, advocacy director for Trikone – an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people – said. ""Surveys have consistently shown that the API community is one of the most vulnerable communities to new HIV infections and these budget cuts will only curtail the testing and awareness efforts taking place in earnest,"" he added. ""Allocating resources should correlate with consistent data that places API community in high risk category and not on how visible our community is. The department's decision clearly implies that our struggles - as the API community - do not matter,"" stated Mallajosyula. The SFDPH has cut its entire annual allocation of $350,000 to the Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center, which claims to be the only organization in San Francisco working on HIV prevention with the API community. ""We've been funded by the City for 25 years,"" Lina Sheth, director of community development and external affairs at the A&amp;PI Wellness Center, told India-West, adding that the organization would have to cut out its youth programs and drastically reduce its services to gay and bisexual men. The Wellness Center operates on an annual budget of $3.5 million, from federal funding and private grants and donations. The organization also does not have funding to provide direct HIV prevention to Asian American women in San Francisco. ""In the New Directions program, women are completely excluded,"" stated Sheth, noting that API women tend to get tested at very late stages, when they already have AIDS. ""As a community, we are very family-oriented, and the stigma of having AIDS is so deep, we wouldn't want to dishonor our family by saying we have it,"" said Sheth, explaining why more APIs do not get tested for the virus. The Indian American community needs ""culturally competent"" organizations to provide HIV prevention services. But Grant Colfax, director of the HIV Prevention and Research Section in the San Francisco Department of Public Health AIDS Office, said the City would ensure that APIs received HIV prevention. ""They have not been cut out of the budget,"" he told India-West. The New Directions program has allocated funds proportionately within ethnicities, dedicating the biggest allotment to high-risk groups, said Colfax. According to data from the SFDPH, Caucasian, African American and Latino gay males are at the highest risk for acquiring new HIV infections, along with transgendered men and intravenous drug users. Asian Americans represented 11 percent of all new HIV infections in 2010, and 8.7 percent of people living with AIDS. Colfax said his budget was based on AIDS data for 2010, and added that 8.7 percent of funding – roughly $844,000 – would be allocated to organizations working on HIV prevention in the API community. Asked to name such organizations, Colfax pointed to Magnet, an organization for gay men which offers free sexual health services, including HIV testing. Magnet, however, has no APIs on its staff or advisory board and its Web site featured no Asian American men. There is no evidence of an increase in HIV infections among Asian American women in San Francisco, stated Colfax, adding that the SFDPH is working to make HIV testing a routine part of health care screenings.

105,8,2011,HIV care centres face closure as NACO stops funds,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/HIV-care-centres-face-closure-as-NACO-stops-funds/articleshow/9547392.cms," NAGPUR: Community care centres (CCCs) meant to serve People Living with HIV (PLHIV) across Maharashtra and Karnataka are facing a huge shortage of funds that has even forced a couple of them to close down. Others may well be on their way. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) is supposed to fund these centres. In the two states, this is done by routing the money through Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT). Since April though, no money has come from NACO and despite many efforts, officials have not responded to NGOs and social workers associated with the centres. This has put a question mark on the future of 66 centres in both states. Many organizations running the CCCs have been spending their own money since the last few months and are no longer in a position to continue doing so. The centres provide anti-retroviral therapy to patients with provision for attending to in-patients as well as out-patients along with counselling. The first centre to provide these services in Pune's Sai Sneha Hospital has closed down. ""Ours is not a very big NGO so not much funds are available with us. We pulled on for about four months without NACO funds, but could not do it anymore so we decided to shut it,"" said Dr Sunil Jagtap from the hospital. Bhagwan Maske, who looks after the only CCC in Bhandara, is also facing similar difficulties. ""We need Rs 1.5 lakh every month. We have not paid our employees for half a year now and they say they want to leave. It would be impossible to run the centres if this situation continues,"" he said adding he was thinking of closing down the centre. KHPT officials said they have helped their partner institutions and tried resolving the issue to the best of their ability. ""Despite not getting any money from NACO, we have given Rs 50 lakh from to the centres that are in dire need to prevent them from shutting. We don't have enough funds with us for all as each centre needs at least Rs 1 lakh per month,"" Dr Mrunal Shetye, project director of KHPT in Maharashtra, said. ""We are in constant touch with NACO and are trying to resolve the issue at the earliest to prevent more centres from closing down,"" he added. He did not elaborate on what the issue holding back the funds was. He said his organization had approached NACO several times. ""KHPT was assigned to give funds for the last financial year. When the contract ended, there was no communication from NACO about discontinuing the arrangement, but the contract has not been renewed,"" informed Datta Patil, executive director of Youth for Unity &amp; Voluntary Action (YUVA), that runs one such centre in the city. ""The money spent on the upkeep of the centres exceeds the funds provided most months. We bridge the gaps ourselves and have never raised the issue, but if no money is to be given at all, it would be difficult for us to run the centres,"" said Amruta Joshi of Bharatiya Aadim Jati Sevak Sangh. ""The money is donated by trusting people in the Global Fund against AIDS, TB &amp; Malaria (GFATM) with the government being only a facilitator. I do not understand how they can stop the funds abruptly without any communication,"" said Deepesh Charles who takes care of the PHLIVs at Mure Memorial Hospital's CCC. The district programme officers of district AIDS prevention and control unit Ganesh Parihar from Nagpur and Sandeep Dhawale from Pune, though aware of the problem, said they were helpless as it was not under their jurisdiction. Efforts to contact NACO headquarters in Delhi were not successful. "

A team of researchers at the the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US created the drug, known by the acronym DRACO, which homes in on infected cells and makes them self-destructive . Its hit list includes human rhinoviruses - the bugs that causes colds in adults and in children - flu, polio, a stomach bug and deadly dengue fever. But DRACO is also expected to zap measles and German measles, cold sores, rabies and even HIV - and could be on pharmacy shelves in a decade, the Daily Mail reported. Lead researcher Mike Rider said, ""It's certainly possible that there's some virus that we aren't able to treat but we haven't found it yet."" In lab tests, DRACO killed 15 viruses. It also saved the lives of mice given a dose of flu that would have killed them. "

A petition filed by K Radhakrishnan, a person living with HIV-AIDS and a resident of Chengalpet, said he received an email in September, 2010 from Arias Home of Hope, an orphanage in Perunkaranai village, informing him that 29 of their children were asked to discontinue their studies at the Panchayat Union Middle School at Perunkaranai. Despite explaining to the school authorities that other students could not contract the illness through small cuts, sharing things, spitting or through urine, they were not convinced enough to let the students return. Radhakrishnan subsequently approached the district elementary education officer and the project director of Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS), but no action was taken. He submitted that the students of different classes were being taught together by one instructor at the orphanage. Pointing out that HIV-positive children needed ""a social environment to secure their rights,"" the petition said discrimination and segregation could create ""an irreparable and permanent stigma"" . Counsel for the petitioner, P Uma of the Human Rights Law Network, said seven children of the group of 29 were in class VIII when they were asked to leave the school last year. ""Since they are out of the elementary education system now, the petitioner plans to follow-up on how they can be taken back to school,"" she said. Passing orders, the bench comprising Chief Justice M Y Eqbal and Justice T S Sivagnanam said the district elementary education officer made a submission in court that 22 children affected with HIV-AIDS were admitted in the Panchayat Union Middle School, Perunkaranai. 29 children were asked to dicontinue their studies at the panchayat school in Kancheepuram district last year "
108,8,2011,Govt asked to pay 3 lakh for HIV infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/Govt-asked-to-pay-3-lakh-for-HIV-infection/articleshow/9633137.cms," CUTTACK: The Orissa High Court has directed the state health department and Red Cross blood bank to pay a compensation amount of Rs three lakh to a four-year-old HIV infected child, who allegedly contracted the virus due to transfusion of infected blood. The infected blood was reportedly provided by the Red Cross blood bank. In a recent direction, the high court bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mohapatra has directed the health department and Red Cross blood bank to share the compensation amount equally. The court's order came in response to a petition filed by the child's father, Pratap Nayak. The petitioner, of Badabarsingh village in Badamba, had alleged that his son had contracted the virus after a blood transfusion. After seven years of marriage, Pratap's first child was born at Kalapathar PHC on October 21, 2007, but it was found that the baby did not have an anal canal. The child underwent an operation at the private nursing home in Bhubaneswar when he was barely four-days-old. A second operation followed and in both cases blood transfusion was warranted. A final surgery was scheduled on February 2009. Prior to it, various tests were conducted and HIV virus was found in the child's blood. On finding this, doctors of the private hospital refused to treat the child. Later Pratap and his wife's blood samples were also tested but both of them were found negative. Pratap works in a chemical factory. At last he approached the high court in 2009 seeking proper treatment for his son and demanded a compensation of Rs 20 lakh. The petitioner alleged that his baby was infected following a post-operative blood transfusion in a private nursing home. ""The high court ordered the health department and the director of Red Cross blood bank to pay compensation of Rs three lakh jointly to the child for the trauma caused and provide free treatment to him,"" said petitioner's counsel Sujata Jena.

109,8,2011,"Scientists move closer to HIV vaccine, isolate antibodies",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Scientists-move-closer-to-HIV-vaccine-isolate-antibodies/articleshow/9654127.cms," NEW DELHI: Scientists have isolated the most powerful broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV so far — a major step towards finding an effective vaccine against the deadly virus. Capable of fighting a broad spectrum of variants of HIV — the virus that causes AIDS — some of the 17 antibodies discovered jointly by The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and The Scripps Research Institute blocked HIV infection of cells as much as 10 to 100 times as potently as the previously discovered bNAbs. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. These HIV neutralizing antibodies are produced naturally by a minority infected with HIV, but who show no symptoms. The new antibodies that target the CD4 binding site on HIV — the site where the virus engages the T cells to initiate its infection — was isolated from blood serum samples across the world. Dr Rajat Goyal, IAVI's India head said, ""This cocktail of bNAbs will help us design the most effective immunogens, the active ingredients of vaccines, which will then help us find the elusive HIV vaccine. Only a minority, who are HIV-positive, begin to produce bNAbs after several years of infection. Animal studies suggest that such antibodies could block HIV infection if they were elicited by a preventive vaccine."" The 17 new bNAbs were isolated from four HIV-positive individuals that are mostly of African descent. Earlier in 2009, this same research team had found two potent bNAbs, PG9 and PG16. Dennis Burton, director of the IAVI Neutralizing Antibody Center, said, ""Most antiviral vaccines depend on stimulating the antibody response to work effectively. Because of HIV's remarkable variability, an effective HIV vaccine will probably have to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. This is why we expect that these new antibodies will prove to be valuable assets in the field of AIDS vaccine research."" Experts say a vaccine against HIV is a must with 7,000 new HIV infections occurring daily and 9 million HIV-infected individuals unable to access life-saving antiretroviral medication. The new bNAbs are encouraging. Many of them bind to unknown molecular structures on the surface of HIV. This means that they could significantly broaden the target options researchers have in designing vaccines to elicit similar antibodies. Since HIV was first identified in 1981, 40 millions have been infected with the virus. Annually, an estimated four million new infections occur, of which 90% are in developing countries. Over the last 25 years, AIDS has claimed more than 25 million lives. It is widely believed that to prevent HIV infection, an AIDS vaccine would need to teach the body to produce these powerful antibodies before exposure to the virus. "

Its concluding programme was held at Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 10. In all, 10 government schools participated in quizzes, declamation contests and ex tempore speech competitions. National Service Scheme’s state liaison officer Bikram Singh Rana said that 13,000 students in various colleges and schools were enrolled in the NSS and they participated in the campaign. Project director of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society, Dr Vanita Gupta, said almost 30% of the world’s HIV/AIDS affected were below 29 years of age and it was important to tell youths about how to avoid this deadly disease.

111,9,2011,HIV+ve undertrial was killed in prison: Probe,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/HIVve-undertrial-was-killed-in-prison-Probe/articleshow/9890868.cms," CHENNAI: Two years after an HIV-positive undertrial’s death in the Cuddalore Central Prison was recorded as a suicide, an inquiry by the revenue divisional officer has found that he was murdered. Twelve prison staff now face criminal and departmental action. Amulbabu was arrested by the Pulianthope police in 2008 on charges of wrongful restraint, causing hurt with weapons, robbery and criminal intimidation. After being lodged in the Vellore Central Prison, he was shifted to Cuddalore prison on July 14, 2009. The prison authorities claimed on August 4, 2009 Amulbabu dashed against a prison wall and inflicted injuries on himself. The same day he was declared dead. The government then ordered an RDO probe. Meanwhile, Amulbabu’s father T Palani, a resident of Patalam near Chennai, approached the Madras high court through his counsel P Pugalenthi, seeking compensation from the state besides registration of murder case against the prison officers. On Tuesday, when the matter came up before Justice D Hariparanthaman, details of the inquiry report as also the government order initiating criminal as well as departmental proceedings against the delinquent personnel were submitted. As per the GO dated August 5, 2011, the prison’s version of Amulbabu’s death was strongly disbelieved by the RDO, who concluded that there was little possibility that a person could inflict such serious injuries on himself while committing suicide. It also pointed out that the death must have occurred at least 12 to 24 hours before the postmortem. Passing strictures against the personnel on duty between 12 and 24 hours before the incident, the RDO also recommended criminal as well as departmental proceedings against 12 persons – eight prison warders, of whom one is no more; deputy jailor Sekar, assistant jailor Jayaraman and two members of the search party. The GO directed the district collector to initiate criminal proceedings and asked the additional DGP (prison) to initiate departmental proceedings against them. According to prison officers, of all these prison personnel, only one prison warder – Gopal – was on duty at the block where the incident occurred. He, however, died on October 1, 2009. Other personnel were on security duty at different parts of the prison premises, they claimed. The RDO report and the subsequent GO will now play a crucial role in the disposal of the petition pending in the HC. "
112,9,2011,Risk of HIV transmission high in Rajasthan: WHO,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Risk-of-HIV-transmission-high-in-Rajasthan-WHO/articleshow/9917317.cms," JAIPUR: Rajasthan is at a higher risk of HIV transmission due to geographical and occupational reasons such as tourism, according to World Health Organisation. WHO officials threw light on Rajasthan’s status relating to HIV/AIDS at a press briefing on the second day of WHO’s South East Asia Region’s 64th session of the Regional Committee meeting here on Thursday. Rajasthan’s Sriganganagar is in category A, while Alwar, Ajmer, Tonk, Udaipur and Barmer are in the category B in terms of risks and prevalence. Category A districts are those which have more than 1% pregnant women suffering HIV/AIDS. Category B stands for districts which have less than 1% prevalence and with more than 5% prevalence in any high risk groups (such as truckers and mine workers). The high risk groups include female sex workers, homosexuals and injection drug users. These districts require priority attention. WHO’s regional advisor Dr Iyanthi Abeywicrame said, “There are many factors which makes Rajasthan a high risk state. The reasons include, people from Rajasthan migrate to high prevalence states like Maharashtra and Gujarat and return with the disease. Another reason is that there are 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh workers, most of them migrants. Also, every day 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan. The truckers have high prevalence of HIV.” She said the state is also important on the map of tourism. “A lot of tourists come to Rajasthan from foreign or from other parts of the country. Also, given the large population of Rajasthan, 68 million, even a small increase in HIV would translate into a large number of cases. Illiteracy is another reason of high risk.” "
113,9,2011,WHO’s HIV strategy endorsed,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/WHOs-HIV-strategy-endorsed/articleshow/9917328.cms," JAIPUR: Expressing concern over the figures that two out of three HIV patients in South-East Asia do not get life-saving drugs, the 11 member states of the region endorsed WHO’s “Regional Health Sector Strategy on HIV (2011-2015)” here on Thursday. Through this regional strategy, WHO urged member countries to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care and to contribute to health- related millennium development goals (MDGs), particularly MDG 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases). To ensure this, primary healthcare needs to be revitalised, and health services integrated to strengthen links between HIV, TB, sexual, reproductive health and maternal and child health. The goals are guided by principles that include tackling the social determinants of health that drive the epidemic and also hinder the response; protecting human rights and promoting gender equality; and integrating HIV and other health services. A WHO official said countries must prioritise advocacy for reducing drug prices, train and sensitise health workers and minimise HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings. HIV testing and counselling needs to be decentralised to enable people to know their HIV status. The goals of the regional strategy are to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care. The second goal is to contribute to the achievement of millennium development goal 6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases) and other health-related goals (MDGs 3, 4, 5 and 8) and associated targets. WHO has four strategic directions to achieve the goals, one is to optimise HIV prevention, care and treatment. This includes preventing sexual transmission of HIV, eliminating congenital syphilis, access to safe blood transfusion, comprehensive and integrated services for sex workers, homosexuals, people who use drugs, young, displaced, mobile and migrant populations. The second direction is to strengthen strategic information systems for HIV research, as information on the various aspects of the issue is crucial in guiding policy and decision-making. The third is to strengthening health systems so that HIV services are part of other essential services that are available, accessible and affordable. The fourth direction is creating a supportive environment to ensure that everyone has equitable access to HIV services. "
114,9,2011,20 thalassemic kids test HIV +ve,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/20-thalassemic-kids-test-HIV-ve/articleshow/9939558.cms," RAJKOT: Twenty thalassemic children from Junagadh have tested HIV positive in the last one year, thanks to the transfusion of infected blood. They are among 100 thalassemic children from Junagadh district who have been coming to the civil hospital there for blood transfusion regularly. The patients arrange for the blood and the hospital merely does the transfusion. Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The disorder results in excessive destruction of red blood cells, which leads to anaemia. Hence, thalassemics need regular blood transfusions to stay alive. There about more than 4,500 thalassemic children in the state. “For the last one year, we have been conducting various medical tests on children who visit our centre for blood transfusion and 20 of them have turned out to be HIV positive,’’ said paediatrician Nilesh Baraiya. Doctors at Junagadh civil hospital say that relatives of thalassemic patients bring blood from blood banks and the transfusion is done at the hospital. “Blood banks screen for HIV but many times, if the blood donor is in the ‘window period’, it is difficult to detect the HIV virus and the risk remains,’’ said a doctor. However, the state does not have Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) for screening of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV 1), Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) virus in donated blood, said Chaitanya Vora of Indian Red-Cross Society, Ahmedabad. “Now, we have to take care of other thalassemic children who are not infected,’’ he added.

Though the prison authorities had referred the death of Amulbabu as a suicide, an inquiry by the revenue divisional officer (RDO) concluded it was a case of murder. The RDO had also recommended criminal as well as departmental action against all the prison personnel who were on duty 12 to two hours before the murder. Taking the RDO report as well as a consequent government order into account, Justice D Hariparanthaman directed the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 5.4 lakh within eight weeks. The state government had earlier expressed its unwillingness to pay anything beyond Rs 1 lakh, which had been paid as solatium to the victim's family. The Pulianthope police arrested Amulbabu in 2008 in connection with a criminal case. Initially lodged at Vellore Central Prison, he was shifted to Cuddalore Central Prison on July 14, 2009. On August 4, 2009, the jail authorities claimed that Amulbabu had sustained grievous injuries after hitting himself against the prison wall. However, a statutory probe by the RDO revealed that it was a case of murder. The present matter relates to a writ petition filed by Amulbabu's father T Palani of Patalam. His counsel, P Pugalenthi, sought adequate compensation for the victim's family in view of the findings of the magisterial probe. According to his plea, Justice Hariparanthaman said: ""In my view, Rs 1 lakh as granted by the state government is general in nature paid for all victims of police torture as provided under the relevant government order. The said amount could be adjusted against the amount payable as per law to Palani for the custodial death of his son"". For the purpose of arriving at a reasonable quantum of compensation, the judge resorted to the multiplier formula as per the Supreme Court rulings as well as provisions of Schedule II of the Motor Vehicle Act. He then directed the government to pay Rs 4.4 lakh to Amulbabu's family, as they had been paid Rs 1 lakh as solatium on August 10, 2011 itself."
116,9,2011,"Give HIV+ve insurance cover, says IRDA",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Give-HIVve-insurance-cover-says-IRDA/articleshow/10000696.cms," NEW DELHI: HIV positive (AIDS) patients should not be denied insurance cover for other diseases they have, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) chief, J Hari Narayan said on Thursday. “Insurance cover will not be given for HIV disease but for other ailments, which are not directly related to that disease and this inclusion of HIV patients in insurance cover will happen,” Narayan said. He urged insurance companies to reconsider the reasons for excluding of HIV+ patients from getting cover. The IRDA on Tuesday had announced guidelines giving insurance companies directions on portability. According to the new guidelines, any customer, dissatisfied with the services of his insurance company, has the option to switch to another company and carry his track record. “There are no issues considering health insurance portability with the insurance companies and we have got assurances from all of them. It will surely come into effect from October 1,” Narayan said on the sidelines of a health insurance summit organized by the CII. Elaborating on the health portability scheme, Narayan said that only two things would be allowed to be carried forward. One, the time already spent in covering the pre-existing disease in one policy would be given credit and a policy holder will have the right to transfer no-claim bonus. However, the premium of the scheme will not be carried forward and would be decided by the new company. The new company would decide the coverage details of the scheme. The regulator is also looking into the issue of allowing banks to sell insurance products of more than one player. “The committee on bancassurance has recommended that banks be permitted with two insurance companies. Right now they can tie up with only one. But the issue is that there are certain weaknesses in current bank insurance companies. We are looking into whether the recommendations of the committee will check these gaps,” said Narayan. "

Maharashtra, which comes next to Andhra Pradesh in HIV -AIDS prevalence -- accounting for 18 per cent of the afflicted population in India -- has launched a multi-pronged drive to curb the menace, initiating various steps under the National Aids Control programme, said Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director, Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS). ""The high prevalence districts in Maharashtra besides Mumbai, include Sangli, Latur, Pune, Satara and Kolhapur. Efforts are on to curb transmission of the infection from high risk groups (HRGs), which consist of sex workers, truckers migrant labourers and drug users, to the common population,"" he told PTI. Deshmukh said HIV positive people are now coming out of the closet to register themselves with government agencies and NGOs to avail the ART, which is being provided free of cost at various government and civil hospitals throughout the state. The widespread network of the affected people was proving to be effective in fighting the stigma attached to their status in society, he said. ""Another challenge the health officials are facing is of ending discrimination in rural schools against children with HIV positive status. The health directorate has launched a drive to sensitise health care providers, workers, NGOs operating at village level. Parents and teachers are being involved in this exercise."" "
118,9,2011,Govt leaves kids with HIV in the lurch: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Govt-leaves-kids-with-HIV-in-the-lurch-Study/articleshow/10024833.cms," NEW DELHI: They live the nightmare everyday, suffering the stigma of being HIV carriers. Little hearts, but sunk by an overwhelming thought that death may strike early. They live in the shadows and prefer anonymity for fear of discrimination. And those who go to school are often ostracized. Nor do they get specialized treatment despite massive funds being pumped for HIV care. What’s shocking is that their numbers are in thousands in Delhi. The city has at least 11,333 children infected with HIV. Most of them, nearly 2000, are concentrated in south Delhi and around 1,700 in the New Delhi area. Others are scattered across the city. The plight of these children has been highlighted in a study commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR). The report states that the nine anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres are not wellequipped and HIV-infected kids are yet to receive benefits of any government scheme. DCPCR has now sent its recommendations to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children. A potent anti-retroviral regimen helps suppress the HIV virus and preserves normal immune response in children. The study was carried out by ARADHYA (Action for Resource Development in Health-Education by Youth Association) over a period of four months — starting March this year. The objective was to map children infected by HIV. Volunteers collected data from the Delhi State AIDS Control Society, ART centres, integrated counseling centres, blood banks, private doctors, counsellors and related agencies to find out the number of HIV patients in the city. Since many cases go unreported, the actual number may be much higher. The report also mentions there are 68,369 HIV-infected persons in the age-group of 14-24 . “We received complaints about discrimination of HIVinfected children in schools. It was then that we decided to collect data on these children. There are at least 77,000 kids below 14 years of age in the country who are HIV-infected . Over 11,000 are in Delhi alone,” said M M Vidyarthi, member, DCPCR. He also said most kids contract HIV from their mothers. Many of those registered for treatment hail from migrant families. Since many of them don’t have identity or residential proofs, they lose out on welfare schemes. HIV-infected kids orphaned by AIDS do not even have a means of livelihood. “Though most parents are sensitive towards their children , they don’t put them through institutional medical care for fear of discrimination ,” he said. The study also states “there are no proper shelters for these kids and they also miss out on schemes for specialized care. Also, the schools are not sensitized enough to provide psychological support to combat trauma .” The focus group carrying out the study also met various families and found that the fare concession while travelling to ART centres promised to HIV-infected by National AIDS Control Organisation in 2008 are difficult to avail because of government red-tape . DCPCR chairperson Amod Kanth said, “We have sent our recommendations and plan of action to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children.” These recommendations include setting up more state-run sponsorship programmes for HIV-positive children for primary and higher education, hostel facilities for infected children, separate schemes for HIV-positive widows, better access to welfare schemes and effective implementation of schemes.

119,9,2011,HIV+ve dumped outside LNJP,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/HIVve-dumped-outside-LNJP/articleshow/10024940.cms," NEW DELHI: Painful shrieks ring out from under a white sheet in the Neurosurgery Emergency ward of LNJP Hospital . It’s a destitute woman crying out for help. HIV-positive , disoriented, and bearing a gaping wound infested with maggots, the 40-year-old woman was found on a street outside the hospital last Monday. The case has again highlighted the plight of mentally unstable destitutes left on the capital’s streets to fend for themselves. When TOI visited the hospital on Saturday, the woman was lying on a bed with a sheet draped over her head. Records show she was earlier treated at the hospital’s ENT department for a severe ear infection and then taken away by an NGO. But this time, she was found dumped outside the hospital, disoriented and sick, with maggots digging into a severely infected wound behind her ear. Sources said the woman had been put through neurological tests and will need regular dressing for her wounds till all the maggots are cleared. Till then, a question mark will hang over her nutrition. Since she is admitted to the emergency ward, there is no arrangement for meals, and her nutritional requirements are not being met as per her physical status, sources said. “She is surviving on intravenous fluids. The staff members have been buying food to feed her off and on,” the source added. LNJP medical superintendent Dr Richa Dewan denied any negligence in the treatment of the destitute woman. “We found her outside our hospital on September 12. She was very sick. But we have admitted her and have managed to give her every possible treatment . But till the maggots are cleared we cannot think of any other kind of intervention. After this problem is solved, we will start her on anti-retro viral treatment (for HIV) and look into her psychiatric needs. She is being kept in the emergency, as it a place where she can be looked after better,” Dewan said. On what the government proposes to do for the growing number of destitutes on the streets, minister for health and family welfare, Kiran Walia, said she was concerned. With no ready solution to offer, the minister said her department was planning to set up two halfway homes for the homeless who are in need of long-term care, and also a hospice for elderly destitutes.

Foundation for Integrated Research in Mental Health, a voluntary health organization based at Thiruvananthapuram, has taken up the case of an HIV positive patient who was denied treatment by a private hospital at Thiruvananthapuram and is moving a petition before the high court challenging the stances taken by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS) towards the treatment denial. Ashok Nair, who is HIV positive, was denied treatment when he was taken to Cosmopolitan hospital at Thiruvananthapuram after he suffered multiple fractures in a traffic accident. He was advised of the need for urgent surgery as he had suffered multiple fractures and was taken to the trauma care wing of the hospital. Ashok told the hospital staff that he was HIV positive. Upon learning that he was HIV positive, the hospital authorities denied to provide treatment to him and referred him to the Medical College Hospital of Thiruvananthapuram. Ashok approached the human rights commission questioning the hospital's denial of treatment. KSACS enquired into the incident and submitted a report that accepted the hospital's stance that the patient was sent back as he was in need of surgery for which the hospital didn't have facilities. When the petition by Ashok was considered by NHRC, it accepted KSACS' report and dismissed allegations of treatment denial.The petitioner alleges that the explanation by the hospital is not credible as their website boasts of a specialty clinic for orthopaedic and trauma care."

While growing need for spreading awareness among high risk groups like commercial sex workers and migrant populations was highlighted during the one-day visit of director general (DG) of NACO, Aradhana Jauhari, to various ART centres in the city on Tuesday, the changing dynamics of HV/AIDS in east UP and Bihar regions of the country also attracted attention on the occasion. ""Awareness holds the key for curbing the menace of HIV in eastern UP region and parts of Bihar that have now become the high priority areas for National AIDS Control Organisation NACO,"" said Jauhari while talking to TOI after visiting the ART centre at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Tuesday. Saying that the invisible killer has continued to spread its tentacles in the Hindi speaking states like UP, Bihar, MP and Rajasthan, she stressed that the selected pockets of east UP and Bihar with high migrant population remain high risk zones in the country. Apart from Varanasi, Jaunpur and Ghazipur, other pockets like Azamgarh-Bhiwandi-Mau and Patna-Muzaffarpur in Bihar have a good number of migrating people who are infecting their family members and local population with the HIV virus. There is an urgent need to spread awareness among the high risk groups of migrant population and devise a strategy to effectively address the issue, she said. It may be mentioned here that the DG of NACO visited ART centres of BHU, SPG Divisional Hospital and DDU Hospital besides holding a meeting of UP NACO officials and other senior district health officials in the day. Stressing the fact that prevention is the only cure in this case, the DG said that eastern UP and Bihar states could learn from the experiences of Tamil Nadu and other southern states that have shown reversal in the trend with receding cases in the last few years. Similarly, advocating for establishment of more ART centres in east UP and Bihar, she also maintained that counselling, support and care services offered through ART centres including integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) and voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTC) need to play pro-active role in spreading awareness. The overall prevalence rate of HIV infection has reduced to 50% in the last one decade, but still the figure is high particularly in the Hindi speaking states. A prevalence rate of 0.3% is far from satisfactory and much work is yet to be done to bring it further down, she added."

An alert was sounded in the state after a counsellor attached with an ICTC in Ichalkaranji was recently nabbed selling the kit, which is given free by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to government-run testing and counselling centres across the country. ""Any kind of illegal activity in respect of HIV testing kit will not be tolerated. We have asked all officials involved in testing and counselling work to be wary of such an activity happening on their premises. The counselor, who was nabbed selling the kit in Inchalkaranji has been dismissed from service,"" said Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society. The case of illegal sale of HIV testing kits came to light in Kolhapur district on September 19, Deshmukh said. ""I received a tip that one person in Ichalkaranji is selling the kits to private laboratories. After checking the information from other sources, we laid a trap. Some of our officials were sent to Ichalkaranji. They approached the person and expressed willingness to purchase the kit. The person, in turn, called up another man who would procure the kits for sale. The man came there and asked for Rs 5,000 for 100 kits. The officials negotiated and purchased 100 kits for Rs 4,000. The culprit turned out to be a counsellor who worked with an ICTC centre in Ichalkaranji."" ""We have dismissed the counsellor from service from September 20. A complaint has been registered with the police,"" Deshmukh added. An ICTC is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical provider. There are now more than 4,000 counselling and testing centres in India, mainly at government hospitals. In Maharashtra, there are 578 ICTCs where testing and counselling is provided free. The main functions of an ICTC are conducting HIV diagnostic tests, providing basic information on the modes of HIV transmission, promoting behavioural change to reduce vulnerability, and link people with other HIV prevention, care and treatment services. ""The Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society receives the HIV testing kits from NACO. From there the kits are distributed to civil surgeons of 33 districts who, in turn, supply them to the ICTC centres in their jurisdictions,"" Deshmukh said."

""We have appealed to public to come forward to help the families of these 23 kids. Within two days, we got an overwhelming response from the public and received Rs 11 lakh. We have organized an event on October 2 at A G School campus where the funds will be distributed among the victims' families,'' deputy mayor, Junagadh Municipal Corporation (JMC), Girish Kotecha said. JMC is the only municipal corporation where the Congress is in power. ""We are hopeful that we would be able to give Rs 1 lakh to each of the 23 kids' families,'' Kotecha said. Interestingly, JMC recently passed a resolution announcing Rs 21,000 support to each of these kids. ""Most of them (kids) come from economically weak backgrounds and we demand that the state government give them Rs 5 lakh as compensation as they contracted HIV due to the government's negligence,'' Kotecha said. The incident came into light three weeks ago from Junagadh Civil Hospital where around 100 children from nearby area get regular blood transfusion. Parents have alleged that their children were infected with HIV positive during blood transfusion at the hospital. But the government denied it saying children may have got infected elsewhere. After the incident came to light, Government sent a team to probe into this matter. ""We are awaiting the report of the team. We will take this issue before the central government. Victims' family members have formally lodged complaints in police station and police have taken them as applications and not as an FIR.'' said Kotecha."
125,10,2011,State AIDS counsellor caught for trying to sell free HIV test kits,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/State-AIDS-counsellor-caught-for-trying-to-sell-free-HIV-test-kits/articleshow/10212125.cms," MUMBAI: In an incident that has shocked the agencies fighting HIV/AIDS in the state, the facilitators themselves were caught indulging in malpractice and trying to make a fast buck by selling HIV testing kits that are supposed to be given free of cost to counselling centres. A corrupt counseller was arrested last week and both he and a lab technician, also involved in the alleged racket, have been dismissed from their job. The incident came to light when Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) officials in Mumbai were informed that outreach workers of an NGO in Kolhapur were trying to sell HIV testing kits. The rapid testing kits, which can reveal an individual's HIV status in less than 30 minutes, is provided to the MSACS by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for free. The MSACS later distributes the kits to its 578 integrated centre for counselling and testing (ICTC) centres across the state. On getting the information, the MSACS officials decided to nab the culprits. Once the investigation started, the officials found that one of their own counsellors, Raghunath Kamble, and lab technician Hemlata Patil were the masterminds and the NGO workers were mere mediators. Additional project director Dr Dilip Deshmukh, who helped nab the culprits with the help of MSACS officials from Kolhapur, told TOI that the incident was shocking and something that the agency had never witnessed. ""The culprit has been handed over to the police and a case has been registered. We are now checking if such a racket exists in other parts of the state,"" he said. District superviser of Kolhapur Niranjan Deshpande was the first one to learn about the racket. Subsequently, on finding that Naagsen Kamble, an outreach worker from Lotus Medical Foundation, was trying to sell the testing kits to private labs, Deshmukh sent some officials as decoy customers. These officials contacted Naagsen, who on September 19 called them to say the deal would be sealed in a hotel at Jaysinghpur, a small town in Kolhapur. ""As our officials, posing as customers, reached the hotel, they found that it was one of our counsellors, Raghunath, who was trying to sell the kits,"" said Deshmukh, adding that he offered Rs 5,000 for two kits, which can conduct up to 100 tests. Deshmukh then contacted the police who arrested Raghunath. During his interrogation, the counsellor told the police that lab technician Hemlata also had some testing kits at her home. ""Hemlata's house was searched and around 30 kits were recovered from her refrigerator,"" added Deshmukh. He said both Raghunath and Hemlata had been dismissed from MSACS. ""We have asked other agencies to be extra cautious,"" he added. A Mumbai District Aids Control Society official said following the latest ""bust-up"", they have given out stricter orders on the already stringent protocols about the distribution and use of the kits to curb any such incident in future."

We have sanctioned financial aid of Rs 600-Rs 800 to around 550 people from the scheme for the destitute,” Jarad said on Friday. During his routine camps in rural Thane, Jarad found that most of the HIV-positive people were facing a financial crisis and owing to the stigma, they were unable to take up physical work. Subsequently, in collaboration with the public health department, Jarad personally conducted a survey of the district. However, HIV-positive people were reluctant to come forward to accept financial assistance. As a special measure, teams were sent to the homes of 550 persons to complete the formalities for the scheme. “We sent out teams to 15 tehsils and identified the beneficiaries, provided them proof of residence, income certificate and civil surgeon’s certificate. Later, we submitted the papers to a high-level committee, which quickly approved the financial assistance,” Jarad said. In Thane district alone, there are 12,000 persons undergoing treatment for HIV, but not all, are eligible. At the state level, a senior public health department official said, there were 4.2 lakh HIV-positive cases. “Of these, over one lakh are below the poverty line. The government should extend the Thane exercise to the entire state,” he said. Of the 4.2 lakh HIV+ve cases in Maharashtra, over a lakh are below the poverty line. The government should extend this exercise to the entire state. "
127,10,2011,HIV positive rate lowest ever,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/HIV-positive-rate-lowest-ever/articleshow/10299228.cms," PANAJI: Over the last four years, 4,453 HIV/AIDS cases have been reported in Goa, and 453 fatalities due to the disease have been recorded during the same period. The HIV/AIDS positive rate in the state, however, is at an all time low, even as the number of people testing for HIV/AIDS is the highest ever. Between 1986 and 2011, over three lakh persons have undergone the test to check for their HIV status in Goa. Of these, 13,913 individuals have tested HIV positive and 1,453 have resulted in AIDS cases to date. The number of male AIDS patients in Goa, between 1986 and 2011, has been more than double at 1,009 of the 444 females detected with the ailment. The highest number of HIV positive cases were reported in Goa in 2007. The number of cases came down to 1,019 in the following year and to 959 in 2009. Last year, the HIV positive cases came further down to 821 and to 459 this year till August. The positivity rate has also come down from 13.41% in the late '90s to 4.77% in 2007 and just 1.86% in 2011 so far. The number of persons testing for HIV, however, has grown exponentially from just 2,279 in 1995 to as much as 18,380 by 2006. The number went up further to 26,737 in 2008 and touched an all time high in the following year to 33,473. In the present year, already 24,691 persons have tested for HIV up to August. This increase in numbers can be attributed to increased awareness of the ailment brought about through state and central government efforts. Over the years, the Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) has set up Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTCs) in three private hospitals in addition to 14 ICTCs operational in government hospitals. An ICTC is where a person goes for counseling and testing for HIV. The person comes entirely of his/her own will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The ICTCs provide HIV testing with pre-test and post-test counseling, drugs for opportunistic infections, free distribution of condoms and follow-up counseling for HIV positive cases through field visits. The centres also provide testing, pre-test and post-test counseling to pregnant mothers who come for ante-natal check ups. Those who test positive are provided psycho-social support and linked to treatment and care."
128,10,2011,Government project prevents 1 lakh fresh HIV cases in five years,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Government-project-prevents-1-lakh-fresh-HIV-cases-in-five-years/articleshow/10308234.cms,"NEW DELHI: About 100, 000 fresh HIV cases among the general population were averted in India in five years by targeting the most vulnerable section. A study — conducted jointly by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, University of Hong Kong and the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) — has found that Avahan successfully slowed the transmission of HIV among the general population by raising the coverage of prevention interventions in high-risk groups like female sex workers, their clients and partners, men who have sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users and truck drivers. Launched in 2003, Avahan received $258 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and complemented the government’s own efforts on HIV prevention. The programme was implemented in four large states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu — and two small northeastern states of Manipur and Nagaland. These six states were estimated to have the highest HIV prevalence in India in 2003, and a total population of 300 million. The study, “Assessment of population-level effect of Avahan, an HIV-prevention initiative in India,” published in the British Medical Journal, The Lancet, says interventions like safe-sex counselling by peers, clinical services like treatment for sexually transmitted infections, distribution of free condoms and needle and syringe exchange programmes among the most-at-risk population prevented the virus from spreading among the general population. Lead author of the study Professor Lalit Dandona from the PHFI told TOI that HIV mainly spread in India through sexual intercourse. He said, “High-risk population like sex workers would infect their clients who would then spread it to other female partners like their wives. Similarly, MSMs infected each other and then spread it within the general population through unprotected sex. Avahan showed us that by targeting high-risk groups, the virus spread among the general population can be controlled.” He added, “HIV prevalence among the general population saw a significant reduction in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra due to Avahan. There wasn’t a very high difference in Tamil Nadu, while there was no significant change in the two northeastern states.” India has an estimated 2.4 million living with HIV, making it one of the largest infected populations in the world.

This is all thanks to a Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation -funded US dollars 338 million project, called Avahan, which was launched in six Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur and Nagaland in 2003. Avahan was launched for the purpose of reducing the spread of HIV in India and developing a model prevention system to encourage others worldwide to adapt and adopt it. The project serves the groups that are most vulnerable to HIV infection, including sex workers, their clients, high-risk men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users in the six Indian states with an estimated population of 300 million. All these six states had the highest prevalences of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in India in 2003, according to the study conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, University of Hong Kong and the Public Health Foundation of India. The study says interventions like safe-sex counselling by peers, treatment for sexually transmitted infections, distribution of free condoms and needle and syringe exchange programmes among the most-at-risk population prevented the virus from spreading among the general population.

On Saturday, two HIV positive women narrated their sordid tales in a media workshop organized by the Rajasthan Network for People Living With HIV/AIDS (RNP+) in Jaipur. They said that the attitude of their inlaws changed when they came to know that they were detected HIV positive. One of them, Manju, said: ""The brother of my husband badly behaved with me when my husband died of AIDS. They expelled me from the house."" Manju's inlaws live in Tonk district. She has two daughters - one is 11-years-old and the other is 8-years-old. Both of them were tested HIV negative. Another woman, Sita from Dholpur, had the same story to tell. She said her husband thrashed him badly when he came to know that she is infected with HIV virus. She was also expelled from the house along with her 7-year-old HIV positive daughter. The RNP+ (women's wing) president Mona said, ""These are not the only two HIV positive women who are expelled by their inlaws. There are so many such cases which have come to light in the past."" She said that such women have to face criticism and they also get stigmatized. ""If the husband and wife both are HIV positive and wife gets tested positive for HIV before husband, then she has to face a lot of criticism and also her husband put a blot on her character. There are so many such cases,"" Mona said. ""The state government can do a lot for such women and their children. We have already submitted a draft of policy to the state government last year on December 1. But, the government has not taken it up. The main points of the policy was single window approach for integrated health services, insurance, legal support, access to economic resources, right to property, right to livelihood, nutrition and educational benefits,"" programme manager, John Samuels, RNP+ said. He alleged that the government has not even constituted a committee to look into the draft policy. Now the organization has decided to take out a rally on children's day on November 14 in support of the policy. They claimed that this would benefit around 25,000 persons and over 80,000 families affected by HIV in the state."

The 200-page notebook has details of her treatment from the day she tested HIV positive. Five years ago, when her husband Raman, a rabbit-hunter, died due to AIDS-related illness what he left was a ruined house and five children. Muniyammal somehow managed to get a loan from the bank and renovated the house. Adding fuel to the fire, she was tested positive two years after her husband's death. The couple's sons left their mother once they got to know about her status. Now, with bouts of TB attack, Muniyammal has to take care of her two daughters, Pachammal (13) and Meenammal (11). Muniyammal's is not a lone case, there are many like her in the Achapatti Street in Kariapatti, a panchayat town near Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district. Kariapatti has a population of 1.65 lakh. The number of HIV cases is increasing in this village due to various reasons. In 2008, there were only 17 HIV cases recorded, but in 2009 it rose to 55 and in 2010, it went to 58. There are 22 discordant couples in Kariapatti area alone. At least 45 people have been tested positive so far this year. There are three main reasons for the increased rate of HIV incidents in Kariapatti, according to Mercy Annapurni of the Blossom Trust, an NGO based in Virudhunagar. ""There is a sizable population of masons who go to Mumbai, Tirupur and Coimbatore for temporary works and return with the virus. Since Kariapatti is the town for all the other villages, transgenders from other places come in groups and camp in the town for commercial sex. The drivers of trucks passing by this area during night halt near Ramu Seethai Polytechnic in Manthiriodai for sex. The place has become a high-risk area now,"" says Annapurni. Vadivammal Kamala, another villager says she knew about her status only after her husband's death. Living alone in an old house without any proper income, none of her four children visit their mother. Frustrated, the 49-year-old even skips her medicine. And this, according to health-worker Muthulakshmy, is a serious problem. ""Social stigma prevents many from having medicines on time. If the patients are aged, then the level of frustration they are undergoing will be high. Many even skip their medicines due to this. We have to monitor each and every one,"" says Muthulakshmy, who has been working for the welfare of the villagers for 10 years. Even though none of the children of Muniyammal and Kamala Meenakshi did not test HIV positive for HIV as both the mothers contracted the disease from their husbands, in the later stages of their life, Rajam was unlucky. She was not aware of her status until she gave birth to her daughter. Staying in a rented house, she struggles to meet the day's end. ""I don't have a regular income. My daughter is studying. I don't know how to survive,"" she says. Despite being a high-risk area, the village also suffers from several a lot of civic issues. Drinking water, according to the villagers, reaches them once in a week. ""We get drinking water only once in a week. Our drainage is choked. Even though the previous government promised us houses, it has not been materialized so far,"" says Munisamy, a villager. However, talking to TOI, a panchayat official said, ""We are conducing regular health-check up for the HIV positive people in all the villages in Kariapatti. Free medicines are given to them. We will definitely look into the civic issues,"" says the official, who didn't want to be named. (Names of the victims have been changed to protect their identity)"

According to the UNAIDS World Aids Day report 2011, the number of new HIV infections has been falling significantly in Asia, with India leading the pack. It said new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths have fallen by 21% from the peak of the epidemic around world. The number of people dying of AIDS-related causes fell to 1.8 million in 2010, down from a peak of 2.2 million in the mid-2000s, while a total of 2.5 million deaths have been averted in low- and middle-income countries since 1995 due to antiretroviral therapy being introduced. ""In South and South-East Asia, the estimated 270,000 new HIV infections in 2010 was 40 per cent less than at the epidemic's peak in 1996,"" said the report. ""In India, the country with the largest number of people living with HIV in the region, new HIV infections fell by 56 per cent,"" it added. Releasing the report here, executive director of UNAIDS Michel Sidibe said the results are satisfactory, but stressed that shared responsibility is needed to combat the epidemic more effectively. ""Even in a very difficult financial crisis, countries are delivering results in the AIDS response. We have seen a massive scale up in access to HIV treatment which has had a dramatic effect on the lives of people everywhere,"" Sidibe said in a release. "
137,11,2011,India not to allow home testing for HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/India-not-to-allow-home-testing-for-HIV/articleshow/10822816.cms," NEW DELHI: India will not allow home testing for HIV. The country’s National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) is against allowing finger pricks or mouth swabs to be used by individuals to know their HIV status. A variety of tests are now available which can produce results in 1–20 minutes. The cost of these tests are also low. However, NACO says its policy is clear – testing will have to accompany pre-testing and post-result counselling. “Self-testing is against Indian national treatment guidelines. We don’t allow it,” a NACO official said. A UNAIDS report on Monday said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is, therefore, a huge barrier to treatment scale up. In India, 40% of the 2.3 million people living with HIV don’t know that they are infected with the deadly virus. A senior health ministry official said, “We don’t want people to self-test and then commit suicide or self harm because they are HIV positive. Also, the quality of such tests are under scrutiny. What if the person harms himself after finding himself HIV positive but he is actually HIV negative?” Around 8,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2010, an estimated 6 million people got tested for HIV. “Counselling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus. In case they are found negative, they are counselled on how to stay that way and about safe sex,” the official said. However, the UNAIDS report 2011 talks about self-testing. “Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing,” the report said. “A recent national study in Kenya showed only 16% of HIV-infected adults knew that they were infected. A variety of tests, from finger pricks to mouth swabs, can now produce results in 1–20 minutes. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,” the report added. One model, according to UNAIDS, has estimated that up to half of new HIV infections among children are caused by stigma, because women refuse to take tests or fail to collect their results. “One option to radically shift test access is self-testing at home. Information and support could be provided remotely. Most importantly, those who tested positive would need a clear access path to health care, starting with a confirmatory test. In September 2011, the United Kingdom’s House of Lords’ select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing,” the report said."
138,11,2011,HIV infections fall 56% in 4 years,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-infections-fall-56-in-4-years/articleshow/10823031.cms," NEW DELHI: In India, new HIV infections fell by 56% between 2006-10. India says it has overshot treatment targets for 2012 — with 4.48 lakh HIV positive patients on the lifesaving anti-retroviral therapy at present, against the target of 3.4 lakh. The UNAIDS HIV AIDS report 2011 released on Monday said that in India, 20-40% of the eligible HIV population was actually receiving ART — one of the lowest HIV treatment coverage in the world. It added that less than 40% of pregnant women had access to ART to prevent new HIV infections among children. “In India, 40% people don’t even know their HIV status. So how can we put them on treatment? UNAIDS estimates include these 40%. “In fact, against a target of putting 3.4 lakh HIV positive people on ART by end of 2012, we expect to cross the five lakh mark by that time,” a health ministry official said. According to the new estimates, 47% (6.6 million) of the estimated 14.2 million people eligible for treatment in low- and middle-income countries were accessing ART in 2010, an increase of 1.35 million since 2009. The year 2010 saw 2.7 million new HIV infections while 1.8 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses. Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, said, “We’ve seen a massive scale up in access to HIV treatment which has had a dramatic effect on the lives of people everywhere.” The report said new HIV infections had been significantly reduced or had stabilized in most parts of the world. The number of new HIV infections in south and south-east Asia dropped by more than 40% between 2006-10. In India, new infections fell. The report said the number of new HIV infections continued to rise in eastern Europe and central Asia, west Asia and North Africa, while it remained stable in other regions."

Global Fund, one of India’s biggest financers of its drive against the three killer diseases — AIDS, TB and malaria — has run out of money to pay for new programes for the next two years due to global economic downturn. India, which has received over $1.7 billion from the Global Fund to run several of its HIV, malaria and TB projects, has no choice but to look at its domestic budget to finance the initiatives. The Geneva-based organization has said it is cancelling its next fundraising round, and the group will focus only on essential services for programmes that end before 2014. This round was the last time that India could have received “free money to fund its health projects. That’s because earlier the Global Fund categorized us as a low-income country. Now, we are entering the bracket as a middle-income country and will no more be eligible for funding from them,” a senior health ministry official said. He added, “What will be worst affected is the HIV programme. We spent most of our funds on prevention (70%) and the rest (30%) on treatment. But if we don’t receive money from Global Fund, we will have to cut down on our prevention strategies. We won’t be able to bring down new HIV cases,” the official added. However Dr R R Rewari from NACO said, “We have a commitment from the Global Fund for treatment of HIV patients till 2015. It might not suffice and we might have to dig into our domestic budget.” Altogether, $22.4 billion has been approved by Global Fund for programmes in 150 nations since 2002. The official said, ""We’re not cutting back, we’re not expanding.” This step takes place even as the recently released UNAIDS World AIDS Report 2011 outlined steadily declining rates of HIV infections. In India, new HIV infections fell by 56% between 1996 and 2010. John Mathai, country director, Global Health Advocates India, said, “This funding gap will affect TB programmes in Orissa, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh, where large successful drives have been run using this mechanism.” "

It is even difficult for those who have been disconnected from the society and do not know about welfare schemes, treatment and related information. But now, they do not have to worry about their problems and queries. Adhar, an NGO here, has decided to provide a helping hand to HIV patients in search of help. Adhar has decided to support HIV positive patients who struggle everyday for tackling even small problems due to fear of people and sometimes due to ignorance. Advocacy group run by Adhar would help HIV patients in creating awareness among them. Talking to TOI, Vidya Tayde, founder of Adhar, said that HIV patients face many problems. From financial problem to fear of social stigma and ignorance about various welfare projects meant for them and treatments, these people are found struggling. Hence, to redress their problems, Alliance, an NGO, has formed advocacy groups to help HIV patients for improving their life at every stage. Alliance has started this project in Amravati, Nagpur, Ahmednagar, Thane and Kolhapur. In Amravati, Alliance has selected Adhar for implementation of this programme, said Tayde. This project will prove to be a boon for HIV positive people. Adhar, under its PACT (promoting access care and treatment project), has already started advocacy. But under this project, the advocacy work will gain momentum and more and more people can be given information which is important for them. Tayde said that the project started from November 1. Presently, analysis and work planning is done as the staff required for the purpose is insufficient, she said. When asked what are the major issues which HIV positive patients have to deal with, Tayde said HIV positive patients face problem during surgery. It is observed that many doctors dodge surgery when the HIV patients are in need, she said. Many patients at the taluka place need to come to Amravati for CD4 which is not convenient for them and burdens their pockets, she said."

Statistics for recent years show that 75% of the state’s HIV-positive pregnant women are under 25 and 50% are detected with the virus only at the time of their first delivery. At present, national policy allows only voluntary testing. “It is more than evident that the women are getting the infection from their husbands, ” said Ramesh D ev k a r, MSACS project director. Lending credibility to this is a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 1997 by a researcher from Pune’s National Aids Research Institute, which put the percentage of women getting HIV from their husbands at 92. “We have to work towards a societal norm where couples insist on testing before tying the knot. Of course, making testing legal is not an option,” Devkar said. This year, 2,027 pregnant women in the rest of Maharashtra and 385 in Mumbai tested positive for HIV. Over the years, the number in the state has gone down: from 4,783 in 2006, to 4,552, 4,162, 3,724 and 3,361 in subsequent years. This year, the number is 2,412 (till October). But the number is still around 3,000. “That means the birth of at least 2,000 HIV-positive children. That is how high the probability of a child getting the infection from the mother is,” said Devkar. “The debate is between discrimination and the possibility of saving two lives.” Many infected women support premarital HIV testing. Kurla resident Ananda (38; name changed) said: “I have faced the stigma of living with HIV for 11 years. My husband passed away a few years ago. I was ostracized by my in-laws to the extent that they did not allow me to meet my son for two years. I got his custody only after my mother-in-law died. Both I and my child would have been spared such a horrible life had pre-marital testing been mandatory.” "

Activists say this leads to underreporting of HIV positive cases, severely impacting prevention drives. The 6 lakh women deliver in private hospitals, which, activists say, are not very cooperative about HIV testing. In contrast, public sector hospitals conduct HIV tests on the 14 lakh pregnant women who are admitted there for delivery. The total number of pregnant women who deliver in the state each year is 21 lakh. The state says achieving HIV testing for 100% of pregnant woman is a distant possibility. This is because over 1,150 primary health centres and sub-centres still do not have any testing facilities. Such centres witness 7 lakh deliveries, but manage to test only about 50,000 women. Mumbai fares better than the rest of the state as the testing percentage is over 80. The state has been thinking of using the network of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) to reach out to more pregnant women. “All we need is a lab technician and a counsellor. We are also willing to train them further,” said Ramesh Devkar, project director, Maharashtra State Aids Control Society."

In Gujarat, 6,170 people were screened between January 2010 and September 2011 wherein 180 people tested positive. Of those who tested positive, 47.22% were below 30 years of age. In addition, 23% people were in 30-40 years of age group. Only 16% were between 40-50 years while 12.77% were above 50 years of age. Highest frequency was predictably in men as 64.44% of those who tasted positive were males while 34.44% were women. Only 1.12% of those detected positive were children. Chief of lab services of Metropolis Healthcare Dr Jatinder Bhatia said, ""Globally, the incidence of HIV that was rapidly increasing between 1990 and1996 has slowly declined between 1996 and 2010. Various treatment methods and awareness programs helped in controlling the disease by creating mass awareness, educating people about safe sex and ill effects of HIV infection. As per the recent data, the incidence of HIV is maximum in younger age groups i.e. 20-30 years which is a major concern.""

""Many positive developments have taken place in the last one decade and they have bolstered our confidence to fight against social stigma and lack of awareness about HIV infection in the region.

Highlighting the change in attitude and approach of HIV positive people in the last one decade, he said that while HIV infected people were not ready to even talk about the infection a decade back, now, they have started to open up and look curious to know about the facilities and treatments available. The taboo attached with the infection is slowly diminishing and even the people from rural background are coming forward to share their problems and experiences, added the man, who waged a battle against the lack of awareness and social stigma along with a group of HIV positive people in the region in 2002. The organisation provides care and support services to HIV positive people who come for screening and treatment at the ART centre, BHU. It has also come up with training and community care counselling to sensitise people in the region. How HIV positive people are opening up could be also gauged from the fact that around 700 HIV positive people have already joined the network to spread awareness in the region. Manoj Singh is living with ART treatment for the last 12 years. The network has also initiated efforts like education support to orphans (losing parents due to HIV infection) and HIV infected children (5-14 years of age).

According to latest statistics, 1563 persons are infected with AIDS and 5694 are HIV positive, compared to 1145(AIDS cases) and 4829 (HIV positive cases) in 2010, revealed project director of state AIDS control society (SACS) Dr M K Pathak. “The graph of HIV positive cases has declined significantly due to awareness amongst people and strong advocacy and sensitization programmes in four years,” he claimed. “During this period, 3,29,900 persons have been screened for HIV, including 1,17,179 pregnant women. It is hard to estimate how many full blown AIDS and HIV positive cases are there in the state, as the screenings undertaken are on those who volunteer as well for pregnant women to avoid infections to the child,” Dr Pathak said. Significantly, the district of Lahaul &amp; Spiti has not reported AIDS cases in the four-year period and districts Kangra, Hamirpur, Mandi and Bilaspur reporting most number of cases, followed by Solan, Shimla, Chamba, Kullu and Sirmaur. The number of integrated counselling centres (ICTC) has gone up from 21 in 2007 to 49 in 2011. At present 1571 patients are undergoing treatments in the state at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers including those in Tanda, Hamirpur and Shimla.“The predominant cause of HIV infections in the state remains unsafe sexual relations and the incidence of infections due to contaminated syringes and blood is quite low,” he said.

There's precious little in them, barring a few unstable beds, some fitted with saline stands, and rickety chairs that cover less than half the dusty floors. The rest is frightfully bare even for a rural hospital. Here, in a cubby-hole, unsanitized chamber, where breathing takes an effort, a team of two doctors, with help from a couple of nurses, helped two HIV-positive women deliver babies this week. There was no hitch and no one refused to attend to the women or humiliated them. On the contrary, the mothers have been assured that the gates of Khanakul Rural Hospital, 120 km from Kolkata - where the feat was pulled off on Monday-Tuesday - will remain open to them for treatment and counselling. Prosenjit Pal, the lone gynaecologist at the hospital, had general physician Susanta Pal for company during the deliveries, one of which was a complicated C-section. They had an anaesthetist and nurses Amita Batabyal and Swati Pal helping them. Both women, aged about 25, are healthy and the newborns - a boy and a girl - are doing fine. Their HIV status, however, is still not clear. The team is proud of its achievement but believes they have just done their duty. ""We were just keen to help these poor women deliver safely. Without our support they would have been helpless, probably even ostracized by the community and left to die without treatment. Ever since they sought our help nine months ago, we were determined to shield them from all adversities and make sure they delivered safely. It was not easy but we managed to do our job,"" said Prosenjit Pal. The women, who probably contracted the deadly virus from their husbands, visited the ramshackle hospital for a pregnancy test earlier this year. To their horror, doctors found that both had HIV. They were immediately taken to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and briefed. ""There were a hundred odds. Touts at the hospital, neighbours and the stigma of an incurable disease with its sexual connotation. But we were determined not to let these affect the women. We took it on as a challenge and kept monitoring them regularly till they got admitted for their delivery,"" said Susanta Pal. Regular checks, counselling and advice through their pregnancy helped the women gain confidence. The doctors and the hospital counsellor Abhijit Maity even counselled their families, convincing them that the disease, though incurable, was not as contagious as it is made out to be. And that they needed their support. It worked. The families stood by the women and made sure no one got to know about their illness. Prosenjit Pal then got about preparing his team for the delivery. Some hospital staff initially refused to cooperate but block medical officer Sabyasachi Saha moved in and made it clear that no one would be allowed to shirk responsibility. ""I told each staff member that they would be thrown out if they refused to work for the patients. There was no murmur after that,"" said Saha. As the delivery date approached, doctors tried to gather all the meagre resources that they had at their disposal. The OT was disinfected and the floors cleaned painstakingly. ""We knew it was not enough and that the babies were still at risk. But we left no stone unturned,"" said Susanta Pal. Last week, it was detected that one of the women had a complication that would necessitate a C-section. So, we had to be on our toes and called for a last-minute meeting to make sure things were in order. We were tense and excited at the same time,"" said Prosenjit Pal. The team camped at the hospital on Sunday night and readied for the first delivery on Monday - the normal one. It went off smoothly with the woman delivering a healthy boy. The next day was the real test. ""Our OT does not have the basic facilities for a Caesarean, which is why such surgeries are not done here. In this case, we couldn't refer her to another hospital, for she would certainly have been refused. Also, neither woman could afford the cost of a sustained treatment,"" said Saha. The surgery was a success with the woman giving birth to a girl. The umbilical cord had got entangled around the baby's neck, but it was successfully negotiated by Pal. ""It was a huge relief for all of us. For nine months, we had been waiting for this day,"" he said. ""The biggest satisfaction is that we have broken the myth and set aside all the obstacles, practically doing the surgery out of nothing,"" said Susanta Pal. Lab technician Saradindu Manna was moved to see the tears in the women's eyes after delivery. ""It reminded us that HIV-infected people have a right to live,"" he said. For 72 hours, the entire team, including the doctors and counsellor Maity stayed put at the hospital, making sure nothing went wrong. No special precautions were taken by doctors other than gloves, an extra gown and glasses. The mothers and their babies were given Neviropine to try and make sure the newborns didn't contract the virus. ""It's still too early to know that. We are keeping our fingers crossed,"" said Prosenjit Pal."

Savio Falleiro, associate professor, Rosary College, Navelim, awarded a PhD for the thesis, found that the disease has made household members above 60 years and below 16 years, both often HIV positive themselves, take up paid employment to make up for the shortfall in income. ""Whether in terms of number of households managing to save or amounts saved, savings are conspicuously extremely poor in case of HIV/AIDS households,"" said Falleiro. He held that close to 40% of households studied also experienced deaths of AIDS members aged between 18-40 years and often employed. ""Many families depend on borrowings and are forced to sell land, jewellery, household items to survive. 75% of HIV/AIDS households made no provision for their children's futures,"" said Falleiro. He felt the state should come up with a mechanism to give equal opportunities to all, irrespective of HIV status, while firms should not fire employees if they can work and if colleagues are not subjected to any risk."
149,12,2011,Early detection can prevent HIV infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Early-detection-can-prevent-HIV-infection/articleshow/10942036.cms," LUCKNOW: Chances of children inheriting HIV infection from their mothers are generally slim, as the disease could be identified only when the baby is about 18 months. However, by this time, nearly 50% of the children born to HIV positive mother die. However, a new technique called dry blood sample testing helps in early detection of the disease and saving lives. Under the new technique a child's blood sample is taken from the heel when the baby is about six-week-old. The blood sample is dropped over a filter paper, dried and sent to the National Centre for Disease Control (formerly known as National Institute for Prevention of Communicable Diseases). Microbiologists examine the sample using polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of HIV virus. In case the virus is found, the referral centre is asked to send the patient to the nearest Anti-Retroviral Therapy centre for a repeat test using whole blood samples. Prof AK Tripathi, head of ART centre at Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University, which offers this testing, said, ""More than 90% of children born with HIV get virus from their parents. The test would help in saving lives or at least improving the quality of life led by them."" Keeping the same in mind, early infant diagnosis services were scaled up in the state. The dried blood testing facility is available at 32 integrated counselling and testing centres in various government hospitals and medical colleges. Medical reports shows 33% of infected mothers would transmit the virus to their babies in the absence of preventive treatment. This happens in three different conditions. First is pregnancy in which the infection is transmitted through the mother's blood. Experts say that the baby is more at the risk if the mother has been recently infected or is at a later stage of AIDS when the viral load is higher. The second risk period is at the time of birth when the baby is exposed to the infected mother's vaginal secretions ad blood. The infant is at the risk of disease during the period of breast-feeding as well. The virus has been found in breast milk in low concentrations and studies have shown that children of HIV infected mother can get HIV infection through breast milk."

This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections. # How it spreads: HIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, handshakes, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person. In India, migrant population, truck drivers, sex workers and IV drug abusers are the worst affected. They in turn spread the disease to their wives, children and clients. # How to get tested: Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) provides free testing and counselling. ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. Those who test positive are referred to the nearest Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre. # Treatment: Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available which can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be put on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment to prevent failure of the drug regimen. # Who To Approach: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies, and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at MLN Medical College provides HIV testing, treatment, counseling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients. # Protection &amp; Support To Children affected with AIDS: In the short term, National Aids Control Programme is reaching out to as many children living with HIV as possible to provide them with the treatment and the care and support services that they need. # In the long term, NACP aims to ensure that every child has access to the same comprehensive set of basic health, education and social protection services, regardless of their HIV status or that of any member of their family.

151,12,2011,AU faculty to patent six compounds against HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/AU-faculty-to-patent-six-compounds-against-HIV/articleshow/10942867.cms," ALLAHABAD: In a major breakthrough against the dreaded AIDS virus, a young faculty from department of Chemistry, Allahabad University along with scientists from National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune, would soon be patenting six new compounds that have proved patent against the dreaded AIDS spreading HIV. Remarkably, these six compounds have shown zero toxicity in fighting against HIV. The pioneering work, developed by Dr R K Singh of AU along with his research scholars and scientists from NARI, for synthesising theses six compounds is the efforts of four years of research work under the project titled 'designing and development of antiviral compound as inhibits of HIV replication' funded by department of Bio-technology (DBT) and Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR). The funding agencies had pumped in a whopping amount of around Rs 11 crores which was distributed among nine institutions of the country, Singh and NARI been given Rs 60 lakhs. ""The achievement is incredible as it has the potential to revolutionise the fight against AIDS as the available drugs against AIDS, including AZT (Azido Thymidine), causes side effect by harming bone marrows whereas all these six compounds are zero toxic"", said Dr Singh. Moreover, since the compounds have been indigenously developed it would help India take a huge leap forward in combating AIDS, he adds. The compounds have been tested on the cell line of HIV at the labs of National Institute of Immunology (NAII), Delhi and NARI, Pune, he added. The achievement of the team is the tedious research work spanning from late 2006 to 2010. ""After computational study of the structure of RT (reverse transcriptase) provided by Crystallographers, we synthesized 40 compounds out of which 12 showed perfect docking-a process which provide information about the interaction between HIV enzymes and possible drug molecule. Out of these dozen compounds, which were positive against HIV, six showed no toxicity whereas the rest had little toxicity, explained Dr Singh. The associated findings of the project have been accepted in 'European journal of medicinal chemistry'. ""The lead compounds synthesized by us have successfully cleared the scanning by the experts in this field after which we have applied for the patenting of the Six compounds and the process of the same is in its final stage"", said Singh."

The Class 11 student, who bagged the second place in her SSLC exams this year, scoring 439 out of 500, dreams of being a doctor so that she can treat others like herself – people who are HIV positive. Though studious and determined, Kamala’s biggest fear is that her classmates and school in Dindigul district will come to know of her condition. She tries her best to keep herself healthy by gorging on food served in the hostel. “She is positive that she can serve children like herself by becoming a doctor. The only thing she asks of me is that I eat well and maintain my health,” says her mother Mangali, who is also HIV positive. Mangali and her children were asked to test themselves when it was discovered that her husband who worked in a hotel in Madurai died of AIDS in 2004. “I didn’t know why he fell ill, and was shocked to discover that both my five-year-old daughter and I were infected,” she said. Her only relief is that her son tested negative. Mother and daughter were taking anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs in 2005. After her husband’s death, Mangali moved in with her sister. As she does not have a house of her own, Mangali was forced to put her children in a hostel with help from the Tamil Nadu Trust for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS. Mangali visits her daughter on every second Sunday of the month and says her daughter never blames anyone for her condition. Kamala’s educational needs are supported by the trust, which is part of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. The trust has provided a corpus fund of Rs 5 crore for educational, medical and nutritional support for children with HIV/AIDS. Ayyappan, president of the Vaigai Network of Positive People, Madurai, said 190 infected children from the area were studying in various schools without revealing their condition. “In spite of all the awareness that is being created, the stigma is still strong. If someone even suspects that a child is infected, he or she will be sent out of school under some claim in no time,” he said. (Names have been changed on request to protect identities) "

That's the moral of the story of Heera and Rani, both HIV positive. They are happily married and blessed with two daughters, one of whom has been confirmed as HIV negative while the other is yet to attain the age to undergo the medical test. Heeralal Rajak, now 36, hails from Garahara village in Begusarai district, 150km from Patna. He was detected HIV positive in 2000. The government would not offer any medical help to people with AIDS in Bihar then. Things became worse for Heera when his Patna-based doctor left Bihar for good in 2004. Heera would then travel to Varanasi to take free medicines from the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at BHU. He also joined Bihar Network for People Living with HIV-AIDS Society (BNP+) and started helping people with HIV. It was in 2007 when Heera had taken two HIV positive persons to a hospital at nearby Mokama that he spotted Rani, a native of Saran district. A widow, now 27, she was all alone after her husband with AIDS died in 2005. Rani's late husband was a daily wage earner in Delhi. ""I inquired about her and came to know she was HIV positive and ostracized by her society. Anything and everything done by her, including food cooked by her, was a no-no for her family and neighbours,"" Heera told TOI over phone from his village on Thursday. Heera fell for Rani. ""I would often make telephone calls to her and inquire about her health,"" he said and added they tied the knot in March 2008 with the consent of their families. The couple's joy knew no bounds when their first daughter, Deepali, tested HIV negative. ""She was born in December 2008. We strictly followed the prescriptions of doctors during the pregnancy of Rani,"" he said. The couple was blessed with a second child in June 2010. ""She is 17 months old. I cannot get her tested for HIV till she attains the age of 18 months,"" Heera said and added she, however, looks like a healthy baby. Heera used to run a grocery shop before his health complications arose. Now, the only source of income for Heera's nine-member joint family is the pension his father draws from the railways as its retired loco pilot. ""We spent thousands of rupees on medicines every month as the government provides only first-line ART drugs free of cost in Bihar,"" Heera said and added he often shudders at the thought of what would be the fate of his family the day the railways stopped paying pension. BNP+ president Gyan Ranjan recalled Heera was hopeless personified when he met him in 2006. ""It's heartening to see he is living a happy life now,"" he said and hoped Heera's happiness would continue for long."

From December 15, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) will assist Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) to launch a campaign in these two districts to create awareness about theme of World AIDS Day ‘Getting to Zero’ -- zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths. The central government has sent a report to the medical, health and family welfare department informing that since these two districts receive high migration of labourers and truckers due to the presence of mines and other mining related industries, the risk of HIV infection remains at an elevated level. Recently, WHO’s regional advisor Dr Iyanthi Abeywicrame, who was in Jaipur, had pointed out that there are many factors for this high risk status. He had said that people from Rajasthan migrate to high prevalence states like Maharashtra and Gujarat and some of them come home infected. Another reason is that the state is home to 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh migrant workers. Also, everyday 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan. The prevalence of HIV is very high among the truckers. Health minister A A Khan said, ""Our efforts are to bring the numbers to zero by 2015 and we are working on to achieve the target."" In Jaipur and Udaipur, NRHM would assist the RSACS to spread the awareness by launching a campaign with Red Ribbon buses from December 15. Joint director of information education and communication Pradeep Choudhary said, ""We will hold camps in the interior areas of the districts where primary health centres are quite far away."" Ajmer chief medical and health officer Dr Laxman Harchandani said, ""In Ajmer there are 1,650 people living with HIV. Since, there are large numbers of truckers and labourers coming to the district, there is always a risk of HIV infection spread. So, the National Aids Control Society has selected Ajmer for Red Ribbon buses."" "

Triomune-30 is a combination of three drugs commonly used in the management of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. A bench of Justices C Nagappan and T Sudanthiram adjourned the matter to Wednesday for further hearing. Additional public prosecutor (APP) S Maharaja took notice for authorities. C Thamilmani has been in jail for 10 years after being sentenced to life for a murder. The petition said he was infected with HIV in 2005 and began treatment from 2007. Though he was taking the drug made available by Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society, it was stopped after he was shifted to the Salem Central prison from Coimbatore Prison about five months ago. His advocate P Pugalenthi said he was not being given the prescribed food for AIDS patient despite the medical officer at Coimbatore prison prescribing it. On May 9, 2011, he sent a representation to the secretary, department of home, prohibition and excise as well as the additional director general of prisons, Salem but no assistance was extended to him, the petition said. When his case came up for hearing, the judges orally mentioned to the APP to instruct the jail superintendent to check the availability of the particular drug at Salem prison. "

So far, there is little clinical experience or treatment knowledge about the other type of HIV. In the absence of clear protocols from the National Aids Control Organization (Naco), most clinicians are groping in the dark about the treatment regime to be followed. There is an equal amount of confusion in diagnosis for want of appropriate testing kits. While both HIV- 1 and 2 have similar modes of transmission and could cause similar opportunistic infections, the latter takes longer to manifest. Studies abroad have shown how people have lived near normal lives for decades without showing any symptoms of illness . However, mothers infected with pure HIV-2 can pass on the infection to their newborns. ""Presently, we have nothing very effective to deal with that,"" said a Naco official who did not wish to be named. In Mumbai, the Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre at JJ Hospital, earlier headed by Dr Alaka Deshpande, was the first to detect HIV-2 infections, document and treat the cases in the city. ""In the last one year, we have diagnosed around 140 patients with HIV-2 ,"" said Deshpande . She insisted that it was high time the government took cognizance of HIV-2 and start actively studying and monitoring it. ""We are facing a situation where patients could develop resistance ,"" she added. A study undertaken by doctors at BYL Nair Hospital between January 2007 and December 2009 showed that 140 out of 42,961 patients had HIV-2 infection . Of these, 90 were exclusively HIV-2 infected, whereas the remaining 59 clients were co-infected with HIV- 1 and 2. The Naco official said efforts to understand HIV-2 have begun . ""Protocols on how to test samples, study viral loads, etc are being worked upon,"" said the Naco officer. Currently, there are no standalone kits widely available to test HIV-2 . Head of the microbiology department at JJ Hospital Dr Ameeta Joshi said that for over a year they have been sending data and samples to the laboratory at the National Institute of Immunohaematology (NII) at Parel.

Although official statistics say that out of a total of over 17,664 samples screened till date, only about 80 cases were positive, a little more than 10 were full-blown AIDS cases and a few deaths wer e reported, this could be the tip of the iceberg. In fact, there is also a feeling that the state government is still denying that AIDS is an ‘issue’ in the state. Only the families of people who have suffered from AIDS and felt the pain and trauma related to the disease seem to understand that the disease poses a big threat. A rapid assessment survey conducted by the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) a few years ago suggested that out of some 320 sample of drug users interviewed in Shillong, 11%, i.e. 36 were female. Only a small number out of those surveyed indicated that they were at risk of acquiring and transmitting the HIV virus, the survey report said, adding the majority perceived no possibility of contacting HIV. Senior officials at the Indian Red Cross Association, Shillong branch, said the campaign hoped to encourage people to address the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV. “Equality for women helps fight AIDS, it needs to be asserted,” said an official. Moreover, lack of economic alternatives where women are forced into flesh trade, lower literacy rate, limited access to information and appropriate health care services places women at greater risk, health officials pointed out. “In fact, to protect themselves from HIV infection, women must not only rely on their own skills, attitudes and behaviour regarding use of condoms, but also on their ability to convince their partners to use them,” an official emphasized. “Prevention strategies must address gender norms and other crucial issues in sexual decision-making, otherwise, campaigns, sensitization programmes etc would be futile,” she underscored. Meanwhile, the department of social work, Martin Luther Christian University, observed the World AIDS Day here today by organizing a poster competition. The participants were from various colleges. The students spread awareness about HIV/AIDS through role plays in Police Bazar and Motphran areas and also distributed pamphlets in several localities of the city. "

The woman had told the society members that her husband left her 20 years ago after infecting her with the disease. The couple had a daughter, who was married off last year. However, the woman, who was employed as a sweeper in a private nursing home in Vadipatti near Madurai, hid her HIV condition from her daughter’s in-laws. In the meantime, the woman applied for the Rs 1000 assistance given by the government to women who had been abandoned by their husbands. She had sought Babu’s help for obtaining the same. After filing up her application, he asked her to meet him in his office. “When she came on Tuesday, I was surprised to see her being accompanied by the four-year-old child,” he said. When Babu inquired with the woman who the girl was, she told him that it was her daughter. “Immediately, I questioned her how she could have such a daughter of that age when her husband had left her 20 years ago. I even asked her angrily if she had an affair,” he said. That was when the woman broke down and narrated the story of the girl. She told him that the child was abandoned by her biological mother in the hospital where she worked and the authorities entrusted her with the duty of putting the child in the cradle baby scheme. “I did not have the heart to abandon the child and decided to bring her up as my own as she would be of support to me,” she said. Babu said that he found the woman’s claims to be genuine and explained to her that what she had done in her ignorance was a grave mistake. She was told that the child would have to pursue a good education to become self-sustained in future. “My only fear is that I will lose this daughter if I have to educate her with the help of officials,” Jaya told TOI. Madurai district social welfare officer M Jayalakshmi told TOI that the woman was not justified in bringing up the child illegally. The child would immediately be handed over to the child welfare committee in Muthupatti and if there are no claimants, then the girl would be produced in court and her foster mother would have to make a claim from there. “If the court deems her unfit to bring up the child, she would come under our care and we will take care of its proper adoption,” she said.

Most of the children are under 14 years of age. 	“The idea of opening an orphanage for children came to my mind when I was working with Spandana network for the welfare of HIV positive people. Then I decided to open a hostel for such children and work for them,” Mahesh told The Times of India. 	Mahesh was recently awarded the ‘Belgaumite of the year’ by AllaboutBelgaum.com “We are giving spiritual education to the children to deal with mental stress, along with school education, medical treatment and nutritious food. Besides, we are trying to provide a social grounding by organizing various social and cultural programmes,” said Nagaratna, an office-bearer of Mahesh Foundation.

Twenty-three thalassaemic children were tested HIV positive in last one year in Junagadh. This raised an alarm over the issue. Those tested HIV positive are among 100 thalassaemic children from across the district who have been coming to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly. The patients arrange for blood, whereas the hospital does the transfusion. A criminal application has come to be filed through advocate Rajesh Dewal, in which it has been contended that following the incident, the parents filed a complaint with local police station. There was a specific demand that the cases should be investigated and the culprits should be booked under sections 308, 328 and 338 of IPC for attempt to culpable homicide and causing injury by administering stupefying drug or poison with intent to cause harm. The lawyer said that police authority was sitting tight over the complaint, and the parents were forced to approach the superintendent of police. But when nothing happened, a petition was filed in the high court seeking directions to police authority to investigate the case after registering an FIR. When this petition came up for hearing before Justice J C Upadhyay, it was pointed out that a PIL was filed by advocate Girish Das, in which similar relief was sought besides demanding compensation of Rs 5 lakh in each of the 23 cases. Acting on the PIL, a division bench had already sought explanation on the issue from various authorities including the state government, Centre and the National Aids Control Organization and director of Gujarat State Council for Blood Transfusion. The court decided to hear the petition filed by parents along with the PIL on next Thursday."

The woman’s family members blamed the Red Cross blood bank for supplying the infected blood. Her enraged relatives ransacked the Red Cross society on Monday and the cops had to intervene to pacify the angry protesters. The 20-year-old woman (name withheld) from Venkateswara colony in Nellore had married a daily wage earner about a year ago. Upon getting pregnant, she was consulting doctors of a private hospital and got admitted to the hospital on November 2. The doctors asked her husband to get three units of blood from the Red Cross society as she was anemic. She was going to be subjected to caesarean section operation and would have needed blood transfusion. Her husband bought three units of blood from Red Cross society, which the doctors used for the operation. She was discharged from hospital a week later with mild fever. However, the woman did not get relief from fever even 15 days after being discharged. Her family members again took her to the hospital where she was subjected to tests. To their utter shock, the blood test report said she had tested positive for HIV. With all the blood tests done before the delivery clearly indicating that she was HIV negative, the doctors suspected that the blood infused during the delivery could have been infected. The family members rushed to the Red Cross society from where they had got the blood but to their surprise, the officials denied that they had sold any blood to them. “They should be arrested and sent to jail for their negligence,” said Nissar Ahmed, the woman’s husband. However, no case has been lodged so far. "

Parents of the infected children had approached the high court demanding directions to the cops to investigate negligence by the Junagadh Civil Hospital authorities. Advocate Girish Das has also filed a PIL demanding investigation and Rs 5 lakh compensation for the affected children and their families. The 23 children came to know that they had been infected with HIV about six months ago when they went for routine check-ups. They were part of a group of 100 children from across Junagadh district, who came to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly. The state government filed an affidavit before the court on Thursday, stating the children might have contracted the infection at non-licensed laboratories where they may have gone for blood transfusion. Acting chief justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya disagreed with the government’s contention and asked its lawyers to file another affidavit with the documents to support the claim. The kids have been infected with a serious disease and the matter needs to be investigated, the court said. The parents have demanded that the accused be booked for culpable homicide and causing injury by administering stupefy-ing drug or poison with intent to cause harm. “We have told the court that the police has not even registered an FIR despite complaints by the parents,” said advocate Rajesh Dewal, representing the parents. The petitioners also demanded that the state government should cancel the licence of the blood bank from where the infected blood was sourced. The court, however, said it will decide on the issue only after the government files its final report. The angry parents joined the Congress’ Satkarma fast against chief minister Narendra Modi’s Sadbhavana mission fast at Junagadh on Thursday. “If the CM really wants to show some sadbhavana, these kids are waiting for it. They have been demanding compensation from the state government but no one had the time for them. Finally, their parents had to move the high court for justice,’’ said Girish Kotecha, Congress leader and deputy mayor of Junagadh. The 23 children came to know that they had been infected with HIV six months ago when they went for routine check-ups. They were part of a group of 100 children who came to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly. "

A team of doctors from a Bangalore hospital came to his rescue: they treated him by transplanting his mother’s kidney into him, despite his HIV status. John and Mohamed Sayeed (name changed), a nurse from Ethiopia, both HIV positive, underwent successful kidney transplantation and are recovering. “The transplants, the first such in Karnataka, are considered path-breaking for two reasons: one, nephrologists are seeing a growing number of patients who need kidney transplants because of associated conditions found in HIV+ patients; second, for the HIV+, it is a fight to even find a place that accepts them for dialysis ,” said Dr Lloyd Vincent, senior consultant nephrologist with Narayana Hrudayalaya. Both John and Mohamed contacted doctors of the hospital through email, after several countries denied them treatment because of their HIV status. After getting positive response from the doctors, they flew down to Bangalore. The doctors put them on pre-transplantation treatment for about four months. “It is not the surgical process, but medical management of these patients that is complicated. The patients need to be trained about side-effects of multiple medications ,” said Dr Vincent. RISKS INVOLVED Although prevalence of HIV is coming down in India, 5% of HIV+ patients are at risk of developing failure of organs like kidney and liver. “This is because the affected blood flows through these two vital organs and makes them weak,” said Dr Ishthiaque Ahmed, nephrologist.

The survey studied the response of 700 persons in the age group of 21 to 60 years and was conducted in corporate firms mainly in south Mumbai. The study, done by two second year BSc students from KC College, Abhishek Kulkarni and Manasi Agarwal, as part of their science honours programme, shows an acute lack of awareness. Dr Suvarna Sharma was the guide. Responding to a question whether HIV/AIDS tests should be made compulsory for every one before marriage, 83% of the respondents had said yes, while the remaining 17% had said no. The study also considered the overall awareness about the disease among men and women in categories like—well aware, fairly aware, moderately aware, less aware and unaware—and the findings indicate that males have a greater degree of overall awareness about knowledge of the disease. About 19.79 % of the men were fairly aware of the disease and its mode of transmission while only 1.25% women had a basic knowledge. The study also showed that arts graduates showed a higher degree of awareness about HIV/AIDS, followed by science graduates, commerce graduates, MBAs and lastly BTech grads. Around 21% of the respondents felt that the whole thing about HIV/AIDS was hype created by the media. The findings are all the more shocking when seen in light of the World Health Organization findings, which state that of the 4.8 million HIV affected people in Asia, 49% are in India. The students’ survey is to be presented at Mumbai university’s Avishkar Research Convention at the Kalina campus. "

""It is difficult to contract HIV, as the virus does not survive outside human body for long. Virus dies as soon as blood dries. HIV contaminated blood, supposedly used for pricks like the ones described, doesn't pose any real risk of transmission,"" Dr Ishwar S Gilada, Secretary General of the AIDS Society of India, said. Delhi Police had recently received a letter that threatened to infect Hazare and his followers with HIV virus contaminated needles, if they remained adamant on Lokpal agitation. The anonymous letter stated that ""a needle team, which has prepared 500 HIV positive needles, would inject the virus in at least 1,000 people at the demonstration"". ""Ironically, such stories arise from the national capital and have a potential to create major panic among the people, particularly among those associated with Hazare's campaign,"" Gilada said. Unfounded theories of HIV spread through casual contacts, needles, eatables and water make panic-stricken people run for help and testing, he remarked."
