0,1,2013,A jab that can halt HIV growth briefly,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/A-jab-that-can-halt-HIV-growth-briefly/articleshow/17881146.cms,"MADRID: A team of Spanish researchers say they have developed a therapeutic vaccine that can temporarily brake growth of the HIV virus in infected patients. The vaccine, based on immune cells exposed to HIV that had been inactivated with heat, was tested on a group of 36 people carrying the virus and the results were the best yet recorded for such a treatment , the team said. “What we did was give instructions to the immune system so it could learn to destroy the virus, which it does not do naturally,” said Felipe Garcia, one of the scientists in the team at Barcelona University’s Hospital Clinic. The therapeutic vaccine, a shot that treats an existing disease rather than preventing it, was safe and led to a dramatic drop in the amount of HIV virus detected in some patients. After 12 weeks of the trial, the HIV viral load dropped by over 90% among 12 of the 22 patients who received the vaccine. Only one among the 11 patients in the control group experienced a similar result. After 24 weeks, the effectiveness had begun to decline with seven of the 20 remaining patients receiving the vaccine enjoying a similar 90% slump in viral load. "
1,1,2013,"Soon, 2nd line of treatment for HIV-affected",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Soon-2nd-line-of-treatment-for-HIV-affected/articleshow/17893944.cms," PANAJI: The Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) has sent a proposal to the regional head of the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) to start a second line of treatment for HIV-infected patients at its Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) center at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim. The ART centre at GMC refers HIV patients who develop resistance to drugs given under the first line of treatment to the J J Hospital in Mumbai. Dr Vanda Viegas, a senior medical officer with the ART center, said that the proposal has been sent to the regional head of NACO in Mahararshtra, and a reply is awaited. ""If a patient does not take medicines properly, he/she develops resistance to the treatment. He/she starts getting an infection and his CD4 blood count starts dopping,"" Viegas said, adding that patients in such a situation are referred to the J J Hospital. ""I send an email to the JJ hospital authorities about the patients, and they are then called for an examination and later, treatment,"" Viegas said. ""We have received a lot of requests from patients to make a second line of treatment available here,"" Viegas said. About 5,000 HIV-infected patients are registered with the ART centre at GMC, which was started in 2005. Of this, 2,500 are on ART. The ART can prolong and improve patients' lives, and potentially reduce the risk of them infecting others. ""At least we can dispense medicines from here and patients would be spared from going to Mumbai for medicines,"" she added. tnn"

The South West District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum ticked off Paramount Diagnostic Centre saying that it was “not only negligent but also rash” in declaring Delhi resident Mohd Dilshad unfit instead of confirming its report through fresh tests.s 	“If the test conducted by the opposite party (Paramount) had to be rerun after four to six weeks to confirm it then the lab could not have reported him unfit on the basis of their (initial) findings... Their haste in declaring him unfit immediately after the test is not only negligent but also rash on their part,” the bench presided by Narendra Kumar said. 	The forum also noted that Paramount's report had been proved “false” by all subsequent tests including one by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) which was conducted within two weeks of the “faulty” report. 	“This faulty report resulted in deprivation of employment to complainant who was a young job seeker of 25 years of age,” the consumer forum said and directed the clinic to pay Dilshad Rs 2 lakh as compensation for loss of job and reputation along with Rs 5,000 as litigation cost. 	Dilshad in his plea had said that he was required to undergo a fitness test after clearing his interview for the job of electrician in a Saudi Arabian company and as per his employer's directions he had visited the diagnostic centre on October 4, 2010 for undergoing the fitness test. 	The clinic in its report said he had tested positive for HIV I and II and declared him unfit for the job, Dilshad said adding that when he got his blood tested at four other labs, including AIIMS, the results came back negative for HIV. 	The lab in its defence has said it was going to hold the tests again after four to six weeks to confirm the results and had followed the proper procedures for conducting such tests. 	The forum, however, rejected the contention saying the defence taken does not mitigate the lab's liability. "

Most of them are orphans even before the age of five. Keeping them alive despite availability of good medicines is quite a task that usually falls on the grandparents. Even with their own health dwindling and no financial support, they are still determined to do their best until they are alive. Big question, however, is what after them? Mamta Godghate, 70, and grandmother of 13-year-old Satyajeet (all names changed), whose parents died when he was just three, narrates the spine chilling story of she working day in and out as a daily wager breaking stones for road making to earn daily bread for her grandson and her sick husband. Tears roll down her cheeks but her words are full of determination. ""I know I am old but I will strive for my grandson till my last breath. It is my duty. I will make him strong enough to take life in his stride before I die,"" she says. There were many grandparents sharing similar stories at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Tuesday during a programme organized by the medicine department's ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre to felicitate children living with HIV/AIDS and encourage them to continue taking medicines and bring a feeling of belongingness in them. Sushma Kathare, grandmother of Kumar who works as farm labourer in Waddhamna, brings her grandson religiously to GMCH once a month. ""Medicines are free but sometimes I don't have money for even the bus ride. I have to borrow but I don't let him miss medicine,"" she said. Aunt of 10-year-old Natisha was thrown out of her own house by her sons for bringing up a HIV positive child but is determined to give him good education. Though their caretakers may be worried, the children are mostly unaware of the gravity of their own disease. They are aware they are HIV-positive and need medication regularly to survive. ""I did not take medicines regularly. My parents died, so I lived for sometime with my uncles. They didn't take me to hospital and said I deserved to die. I am now living in an orphanage. Now I am on second line of ART only because I discontinued the medicines,"" said 13-year-old Kshitij who came alone for the programme. There were two other boys who also had come alone but were being brought up by their grandparents. GMCH dean Dr Rajaram Powar, medicine head Dr Y B Bansod, ART Centre senior medical officer Dr Megha Navade, centre counsellor Preeti Kadu, and the chief guest Raje Sangram Singh Bhosale, city businessman Kishor Rathi and Tanuja Sheware felicitated the children and gave them blankets, books, balls and toys."

She wants to join them but knows that their parents will shoo her away or take away their wards. This HIV positive girl lost her parents some years ago and lives in a special home in the eastern part of the city. Namrata is not the only girl silently tolerating discrimination due to her disease. There are 32 HIV and orphaned girls, aged between 2 and 16, living in this special home, who want to desperately move out of their present home to save themselves from the daily trauma. “We have not disclosed their illness to anyone but locals are still opposing their existence in the apartment. They keep telling that we should leave the place,” said Daksha Patel, vice-president and founder of GSNP+. Gujarat State Network for Positive People (GSNP+), a community-based organization, takes care of such children. “We are trying to help these girls get education and lead a normal life. But the discrimination by people living around reminds them about their illness,” said Patel. GSNP+ was also awaiting government’s response to a request for land so that they can accommodate more girls. “Their request has been forwarded to senior officials in Gandhinagar. It is under consideration,” said Gita Vyas, in-charge, social justice office. The monthly expense of Rs 1,000 per child given by the government is also meager to meet their daily needs. “We are forced to collect money through donations which help us spend Rs 2,000 per girl,” said a GNSP+ office bearer. Businessman comes to girls’ rescue A local businessman, Mahesh Savani, has offered to provide accommodation to the orphaned girls. “The place I have offered them is safe and they will not face any discrimination here,” said Savani. The girls will shift to the new place in a few days. "

Counsellor at Integrated Counselling Testing Centre, sadar hospital Satyajit Kumar Sinha said: ""Earlier people used to be hesitant while bringing up issues related to AIDS. The society has seen a huge transformation and now people especially the youth are open to discussing such crucial matters openly. Many come to my clinic to get tested before marriage. It is a question of someone's life and can even cause relationships to break. It is a good thing that awareness has increased. This will save lives."" According to youths an HIV test is the most important thing before getting into a marital bond. Horoscope matching has taken a backseat nowadays. ""As today's generation takes a relationship to the next level faster than it used to be before sexually transmitted diseases are common. So my father has decided that before my marriage the groom will have to undergo an HIV test. Matching horoscopes is not that essential as compared to this,"" said Anita Shukla, who is going to tie the knot in the coming month. On similar lines Amit Aggrawal, an engineer who will soon get married said: ""I don't believe much on the planetary stars which may impact our future life. I believe in health check up which should be the priority and that too when it comes to a deadly disease like HIV/AIDS. With the test the couple can lead a healthy life and will also have a beautiful relationship for the rest of their life."""

He attends regular school and aspires to be an engineer one day. Yet, he can't be counted among those millions of children who on completing their education, will go into the profession of their choice, become parents and grow old. Varun's case is different because he is HIV positive. At his age and oblivious of his life threatening condition Varun wants to excel in his studies brushing aside the occasional bout of illness. ""I'm studying in class IV,"" he told TOI. His mother Radha corrected him saying, ""He is in class I studying in the English medium."" Radha came to Goa from Karwar with her two sons to avail of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Varun who had studied up to class IV in the Kannada medium was admitted to class I in a boarding school in Goa where the medium of instruction is English. ""He didn't know English when he came last year but he is catching up fast,"" his proud mother said. Varun might not understand what afflicts him, but thanks to his monthly trips to the ART centre he has sensed that ""something is very wrong with him"". His eyes turn moist and he tries to hide behind his mother when asked ""whether he is sick or if he feels sick"". The ART center at Goa medical college and hospital (GMC) provides ART to about 2,000 HIV persons, including 250-300 children. Dr Vanda Viegas of the ART centre said HIV infected children are also put on ART to protect them from opportunistic infections. ""With good care and intake of nutritional food they can lead a normal life,"" Viegas said. Viegas said that in the absence of any concrete study it is difficult to tell how long a person on ART will live. ""There are no studies done here,"" Viegas said. During the last seven years since the ART centre was started in GMC, at least four children that were on ART have died. Radha tested positive for HIV during her first pregnancy. She knows she got the infection from her husband who died two years ago but accepted it with equanimity. She stays in Margao in a tiny rented premises paying a monthly rent of Rs 600, and takes up odd jobs to support herself and her two sons.

It was celebration time at Nevta village in Jaipur district, as the trio – Elyse Oldroyd and Bec Doyle from Australia and Anu Karjalainen from Finland laid the foundation stone for their dream home 10 days ago. Around the land, where the home would be constructed, is a vast stretch of land for agriculture purpose. There is not a single house constructed in the nearby area. But, on Sunday, the place was full of life. A large number of children were present in the village, a pundit was also called for the rituals and well-wishers participated in the ceremony. The children were happy as they were on the verge of getting a new permanent house. The home will be known as Gandhigram — Aashray Care Home, a rehabilitation centre for children in need. Elyse and Bec collected funds for the house from their friends and their relatives in Australia. It is not the first time that Elyse and Bec have come to Jaipur; they had been here in 2011 as travellers. Twenty-one-year-old Elyse Oldroyd, who lives in Sydney said, “I am a student studying Bachelor of Arts (sociology) and Master of nursing at University of Sydney. I also work as a caretaker of children, and as a shop assistant in between my studies. I graduated from high when I was 18 in 2009. Later I decided to take out two years to travel before beginning university studies. I spent 2010 in Europe and in 2011, with Bec, worked in America and volunteered in Asia. This is where I first came into contact with Aashray Care Home.” Like Elyse, Bec also took a break from her studies and decided to travel. Both of them enjoy surfing, sports, reading and travelling. But, when they come in contact with Aashray Care Home, it became their dream to build a permanent house for the children. Bec (21), too lives in Sydney like Elyse. She said, “I am studying bachelors of social work at the University of Sydney. I work as a carer for young children part time and also as a retail assistant at a shop. I graduated from high school in 2009 at the age of 18. I felt I was not ready to continue my studies and wanted to explore the world, so I took two years off and travelled, spending a portion of 2010 in Europe, and 2011 with Elyse, I explored USA and Asia. Somehow, we came to Jaipur and met the children in Aashray Care Home living in the rented accommodation.” She said, “We were only supposed to be staying with them for a week. However, we fell in love with all the children, and stayed here for a month.” “Right now it is summer holidays in Australia. Since we were missing all the children at Aashray we had to come back to spend time with them. Prior to our second visit here , we were able to raise some funds.” The girls thanked their friends and family back home for the funds. Twenty-seven-year-old, Anu Karjalainen, who lives in Helsinki, Finland, is a public health nurse. "

But as he awaits discharge from Jaslok Hospital, his positive feelings are tinged with bitterness. Although his mother, Kamala (name changed) donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son in operations held on February 1, the family had to wait for seven months to complete the paperwork needed for the transplant. ""I live in Mumbai while my mother lives in Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh. We went back and forth several times in this period to get the paperwork done,'' he said. The delay was caused mainly due to the stringent transplant rules. ""Here, a mother has given a kidney to her son. As per the transplant Act, this is a familial transplant and doesn't require any no-objection certificate,'' said Dr Rushi Deshpande, who is Singh's nephrologist. But Maharashtra government rules require an NOC even in case of families when the donor is from outside the state. In fact, the matter is being heard by the Bombay high court following a petition filed by a nephrologist protesting against this rule. ""The hospital had told us five months back that my husband is healthy enough to undergo a transplant, but the paperwork delayed us immensely,'' said Singh's wife. She was particularly worried about his counts falling due to his HIV status. ""Even though his HIV specialist Dr J K Maniar managed to keep his counts well, it was difficult for us to find a hospital that was willing to conduct his dialysis. We were charged extra for each session because of his condition,'' she added. On February 1, after 17 days of preparation and a seven-month wait, the operation was carried out. ""The most difficult aspect of a transplant for an HIV-positive patient is the tightrope walk between avoiding rejection and complex infections (due to HIV). So it took us 17 days to work out the right combination for Singh,'' said Dr Deshpande, adding that Singh would be discharged on Wednesday with a normal kidney function showing serum creatnine of 1. Singh is the third HIV-positive patient to get a kidney in Mumbai. When contacted, a senior government official said the government was, on directions from the high court, reworking the NoC clause."

HC gave the direction while accepting the report filed by standing counsel Pawan Sharma stating that the medical examination of the victim and the three other juveniles, whom he had accused of sexual abuse, found that except the victim no other juvenile is HIV positive. 	A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Indermeet Kaur then asked the counsel to file a fresh status report by March 13, 2013, saying ""an endeavor be made to find out as to the reason why the victim is making allegations against other children and as to who is actually responsible for abuse of the victim."" 	HC took notice of the case on the basis of a TOI report highlighting the allegations leveled by the child against three others. The bench had directed the authorities to conduct a medical examination of the victim and the other boys he had accused of sexual abuse. It had also asked the police to verify and investigate. 	In its report, the police further informed HC that the three boys accused by the child have been shifted to another boys' home as directed by the court. The victim is presently lodged in government's Ashiana Home for Boys in Alipur in Rohini area and had alleged repeated sexual abuse by older boys. 	According to the TOI report, the victim's mother died of AIDS while his stepfather is lodged in Tihar Jail for raping his daughter, and is also an HIV patient. 	While the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) decided to keep the child out of the home and place him in the custody of NGO Child Survival India, which reported the matter on February 4, the Committee is reportedly yet to take action against the staff and officials running the institution. 	In a letter to the CWC, the NGO has mentioned that the child told counsellors that children at the home use to sexually abuse and harass him daily and he did not want to return to the home. 	The NGO has expressed concern that other children may also be subject to such abuse and has urged the CWC to take further action. "

After approving same sex marriage, UK in a string of landmark decisions has cleared the way for women aged 40 to 42 to be allowed one cycle of IVF so long as it is their first attempt. Previously the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) only recommended treatment up to the age of 39. In its updated guidelines for NHS that will fund these IVF procedures, lesbian couples will also qualify for IVF so long as they have been diagnosed with infertility problem. Women suffering from infectious diseases like Hepatitis and HIV or those who suffer from physical disabilities that hinder them from having intercourse will also be eligible. The updated NICE guidelines released on Wednesday says, “More women can receive appropriate and timely fertility treatment such as IVF. Infertility is a common medical condition which can have devastating and painful. It is caused by various reasons, with a quarter of cases unexplained, a further quarter caused by ovulatory disorders, and 30% cases due to factors affecting male fertility.” NICE says women aged between 40 and 42 years should be offered one full cycle of IVF if they have not conceived after two years of regular unprotected intercourse, or 12 cycles of artificial insemination where six or more are by intrauterine insemination.

14,3,2013,Team of US doctors claims to have cured infant of HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Team-of-US-doctors-claims-to-have-cured-infant-of-HIV/articleshow/18804049.cms,"LONDON: American researchers claimed to have cured an infant of HIV infection in a medical breakthrough that raises hopes for thousands of babies across the world who contract the deadly virus in their mother’s wombs. This is the first child — and only the second HIV-infected person — to have been cured of the disease, if the claim announced on Sunday by a research team from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center (JHCC) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School is found to be true. The team hoped that the success could be replicated in other children born with HIV which would pave the way for eliminating the disease among children. HIV-related breakthroughs are rare and finding a vaccine has been a daunting challenge thanks to the ability of the virus to slip through. The researchers put a Mississippi-born infant, whose mother is HIV-positive, to antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 hours of birth. The prompt administration led to the cure by halting the formation of hard-to-treat viral reservoirs — dormant cells responsible for reigniting the infection in most HIV patients within weeks of stopping the therapy. A series of tests showed progressively diminishing viral presence in the infant's blood, until it reached undetectable levels 29 days after birth. The infant remained on antivirals till 18 months of age. Ten months after the treatment was discontinued, the child underwent repeated blood tests, none of which detected HIV. Test for HIV-specific antibodies — the infection’s standard clinical indicator — also remained negative throughout. “Prompt ART in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long-term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place,” said JHCC virologist Deborah Persaud. “Our next step is to find out if this is a highly unusual response to very early antiretroviral therapy or something we can actually replicate in other high-risk newborns,” Persaud added. Will it work for adults? The only other HIV-positive person to be cured was Timothy Brown, a middle-aged man with leukemia who got cured after receiving a bone-marrow transplant from a donor genetically resistant to HIV infection. In the current case, the New York Times cited experts saying they needed convincing that the baby had truly been infected in the first place. “If not, this would be a case of prevention, something already done for babies born to infected mothers,” it reported. Other experts were quoted as saying that the findings in the baby would probably not be relevant to adults. The researchers said they did not have enough data at the moment to recommend changes to the current practice of using preventive rather than therapeutic treatment for high-risk infants. They said complete viral eradication on a large scale was their long-term goal. “But, for now, (it) remains out of reach, and our best chance may come from aggressive, timely and precisely targeted use of antiviral therapies in high-risk newborns as a way to achieve functional cure,” the researchers said in their report. Functional cure allows a patient to be free of the HIV virus without lifelong treatment, besides preventing HIV replication in the blood. In this case, viral presence is so minimal that it remains undetectable by standard clinical tests. It is discernible only through ultrasensitive methods. “Prevention really is the best cure, and we already have proven strategies that can prevent 98% of newborn infections by identifying and treating HIV-positive pregnant women,” the report said. The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world. In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011. A latest UNAIDS Global HIV Epidemic Report revealed that 72% HIV-infected children in India and South East Asia do not have access to treatment. In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children. "

16,3,2013,Village girls work for HIV+ awareness,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Village-girls-work-for-HIV-awareness/articleshow/18872448.cms,"PATNA: They are the harbingers of hope, peace and development in this small hamlet Majhaulia of Muzaffarpur district. They fought against ignorance, myths, and socio-cultural taboos and broke through the wall of silence to lend voice to the voiceless. Inevitably, they ran into barriers. But determined to fight and overcome all odds, these young Muslim activists of Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (RRC) have today ushered in a silent revolution in this village. This includes an outreach strategy to address HIV+ prevention, care and support and treatment in this vulnerable district. Talking about sex was virtually taboo in this village, so for young Muslim girls, mostly in their teens, initiating any discussion on the issue was to invite controversy. But that is what Amina Khatoon, a 17-year-old girl, has done ever since she was made president of the 70-member RRC. She comes from a poor family and also works as a part-time dressmaker. April 14, 2009, was a memorable day for Amina when Nirdesh (an NGO) link worker Kumkum Kumari, formed the Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (KRRC) at the village with 21 girls. Prior to this, these girls had never come out in the open without ‘purdah’ and mingled with each other freely. The most sensitive and important issue about which they learnt was the disastrous effect of HIV/AIDS. “I had to make a huge effort to make these girls understand the challenge of HIV/AIDS, particularly in rural areas, as here it becomes more pronounced in view of stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV, resulting in poor access to health care, and, above all, infections going undetected or treated by unqualified practitioners,” said Kumkum. Soon these girls started spreading awareness about prevention and protection from HIV/AIDS among the rural community. They were also imparted training at various places, which changed their outlook and provided them a broader vision. The effort made by these girls was soon recognized by Unicef too. The girls were then provided a sewing machine and a ceiling fan. Today these girls, apart from generating social awareness are also learning skills like stitching, puppet-making, hosiery making etc to make their life better. KRRC is constantly expanding its base and now has 70 members, of which 20 are young boys. Sajda, Naznin, Momina, Shaba, Ruksana, Raksa, Mohd Raja, Aftab… all are enthusiastically involved in their assignments. The slogan on the walls of Majhaulia reads, “Hum sabka hai yehi sapna, AIDS-mukt ho Bihar apna.” "

The finding is an important step towards developing a vaginal gel that may prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis said. “Our hope is that in places where HIV is running rampant, people could use this gel as a preventive measure to stop the initial infection,” said researcher Joshua L Hood. Bee venom contains a potent toxin called melittin that can poke holes in the protective envelope that surrounds HIV, and other viruses. Large amounts of free melittin can cause a lot of damage. The new study shows that melittin loaded onto these nanoparticles does not harm normal cells because Hood added protective bumpers to the nanoparticle surface. When the nanoparticles come into contact with normal cells, which are much larger in size, the particles simply bounce off. "

In 1998 when the Arunachal Pradesh Aids Control Society was set up, only two HIV positive cases were reported in the entire state, but the figure rose to 202 as per the latest count made in December, 2012. ""People are still very casual in approach to the disease,"" deputy director of Arunachal Pradesh Aids Control Society (APSACS), Tasor Pali, said. ""Unless people are aware, no effort of waging war against AIDS will bear fruit,"" Pali, who is also in charge of Information Education Communication, said. According to a recent survey by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), estimated cases of AIDS in the state was 1080, Pali said. He said the actual number of AIDS positive cases would be much higher as the figures available with APSACS were only of those who voluntarily came for testing. ""Awareness is the only visible vaccine available against the killer disease,"" he said. According to APSACS, the number of male HIV positive patients in the state was 137 and female 65. APSACS has been engaged in targeted intervention through several NGOs working under it of high risk groups such as sex workers, intravenous drug users, truck drivers and migrant labourers. India has the world's third largest HIV/AIDS-affected population and the Northeast the worst-affected, according to the United Nations. "

The centre would be formally launched by Dr Manohar Pawar, deputy director of health services, on Friday at 11am. Speaking to reporters about the centre, district civil surgeon Dr V D Bade said that the satellite town of Kamptee attracted a lot of a migrant population due to various companies, collieries, and transport businesses and this brought in commercial sex workers as well. Hence, the health department provided for the ART centre for better treatment of HIV-positive patients of the area. With this centre, they would not need to come to city to procure drugs that are to be taken by the affected persons all their life. Though there has been a substantial fall in the HIV-positive mothers as well as the high risk population in Nagpur district in the past 4-5 years, there has been a rise in cases in Kamptee area both in general population as well as of mothers. Tanuja Fale, district programme officer HIV/AIDS project, said the incidence of HIV positivity inn mothers had fallen from 0.32% (171 positive) to 0.17% (88 positive) from 2011 to February 2013. This figure in high risk population has, however, seen only a marginal fall from 3.20% (2300 positive persons) to 3.07% (1768 persons) during the same period. The HIV positivity rate in the town was as high as 7% in general population and 0.63% in mothers in 2008 but the rate dropped substantially over the years. Yet there is still a cause of concern for the relatively high number of patients in both the groups and hence the need for a separate ART Centre in Kamptee which draws people for work from even areas like Pardi Naka, Tarsa and Mouda. This year alone, the health department has found 61 more new cases. The state health department, with financial help from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), is starting the centre to cater to the local population. NACO would be providing funds for the salaries of all the seven staff members including the medical officers, technical and lab staff, counsellors and project coordinators. Health department is working in coordination with other agencies like Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Government Medical College and Hospital, Daga Memorial Hospital as well selected private hospitals in the city to filter out patients of the area and provide them drugs at Kamptee itself as the high risk population needed to be monitored regularly to check the spread of the disease. Dr Umesh Nawade, medical superintendent of Kamptee, was also present."

The girl, from Mananthawady in Wayanad, is suffering from Thalassemia and has been undergoing regular blood transfusion at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital and district hospital, Mananthawadi, for the past six-and-a-half years. It is suspected that the girl got infected with HIV either from contaminated blood or an inadequately sterilized syringe. After a test in July 2012 first showed her to be HIV positive, the girl was again subjected to the Elisa test in September, which confirmed the earlier result. Her relatives, including her parents and three-year-old sibling, also underwent the test but all of them tested negative. Wayanad district medical officer Dr Sameera said there was no lapse on her part as she had informed the Kerala AIDS control society soon after the girl's parents informed her about the development. Kozhikode Medical College authorities too said there was little chance of the girl getting HIV infected during blood transfusion at the hospital because the blood bank screened all donors. However, Dr Ramani, additional director of health services who met relatives of the girl at Wayanad, hinted at a possible loophole in this screening process when she explained that if the blood of an HIV positive person is in the window period (within 20-25 days of contracting the disease), the disease cannot be detected in Elisa test. State health minister V S Sivakumar termed the incident sad and unfortunate and said all precautions will be taken to ensure it is not repeated."

The court on Wednesday ordered his reinstatement with 50% back wages in two weeks. The writ appeal by Narayanappa, 51, was allowed by a division bench headed by Justice KL Manjunath. The bench noted that Msrs Stride Arco Lab Limited, a tablet manufacturing company and an export-oriented unit, refused employment to the son of the appellant (Narayanappa) as an alternative measure. Narayanappa claimed that refusal of employment to HIV-infected persons goes against the national policy. Narayanappa, who is said to have sold two acres of his land for the company to set up its plant at Suragajakkanahalli village, Anekal taluk in Bangalore Urban district, was offered a job in the maintenance department in August 1998, with a salary of Rs 2,050 per month. However, from October 3, 1999, he wasn't given the job after a medical examination revealed he'd tested positive for HIV. The company claimed Narayanappa voluntarily stopped coming to work after he came to know about the medical condition. Narayanappa's plea before the labour court was dismissed on October 20, 2010, on the ground of delay as he had sent a notice to the company only in July 2003, after four-and-a-half years. The single bench dismissed his petition saying he had failed to explain the delay.NICE plea against TJ Abraham referred to CJ NICE company, the BMIC project proponent, filed an application seeking initiation of suo motu contempt of court action against activist TJ Abraham, who is also a complainant before the special Lokayukta court. Justice H Billappa referred the application seeking contempt-of-court action, the memo filed by Abraham and NICE objections, before the Chief Justice for further orders.

Of the newly reported cases, 64.8 per cent of the infections are attributable to homosexual contact, Yu said, adding that 87 per cent of the total HIV/AIDS cases in 2012 came via sexual transmission. In total, China has reported more than 7,000 HIV positive students. The first AIDS patient in China was found in 1985 . According to previous reports about 18,000 people died of AIDS in the first ten months of last year in China as number of HIV cases touched about five lakh.

The city has recorded a remarkable dip in the number of cross-infections and the success has been attributed to early detection and awareness. HIV, per se, does not kill but rather makes the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections by lowering immunity. Tuberculosis takes the top spot as the biggest opportunistic infection and killer among HIV patients. Statistics compiled by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) has revealed how in the last six years the incidence of tuberculosis in HIV suspects has halved. If 15% of patients who walked in for HIV testing in 2007 were found to be suffering from TB, it came down to 7% till last year. The same trend has been witnessed in those suffering from tuberculosis. TB patients remain highly vulnerable to HIV as global numbers suggest that around 13-14% end up contracting the bacterial infection. Here too, the MDACS records show that significant improvement has been made. From an incidence of 10% TB patients contracting HIV, the percentage has come down to 3% and remained there in the last two years. Additional project director of MDACS Dr Balkrishna Adsul said increased awareness among both set of patients could be one of the main reasons. According to Dr Minni Khetarpal, BMC’s special tuberculosis officer, a smooth synchronization of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) has contributed to almost 100% of the patients suffering from the co-infection getting the right drugs. “We have made it mandatory for the TB officers to send the patients for HIV testing within a month of enrolling in RNTCP,” she said.

26,4,2013,Guntur HIV positive girl baffles doctors,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Guntur-HIV-positive-girl-baffles-doctors/articleshow/19389997.cms,"HYDERABAD: Questions on how the 18-month-old girl from Guntur got HIV virus still remain unanswered. While the tests carried out by a Chennai-based lab have confirmed that the baby has the deadly virus, they have ruled out that the source of the disease is either her parents or a donor. Doctors in both the states now say that only a paternity test will reveal if the father of the baby is her biological parent. ""We got an oral report from the Chennai-based lab that the DNA PCR test revealed that the girl is HIV positive, while both parents are negative. We are yet to receive the report copy,"" said the doctor at the hospital. ""Maybe the parents are wrongly claiming that she is their child. A paternity test will perhaps reveal the truth,"" said a doctor at the Guntur Medical College, who cannot be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Her father and a donor had once donated blood to her. But district health authorities informed that the donor was traced and he tested negative for HIV. Now, the flummoxed medical team suspects the donor could have been in the window period (time between the onset of HIV infection and the appearance of detectable antibodies of the virus) when the blood was transfused to the child. Any antibody-based blood tests, such as ELISA and rapid test, conducted during the window period may give negative results. During this window period the individual is already infected and may unknowingly infect other people. Doctors say a thorough probe can also reveal if the child was adopted or a healthy baby was swapped after birth. ""There are endless possibilities, but the case has become so complicated,"" a hospital source said. Doctors at the Guntur hospital are now preparing the girl for Anti Retroviral Therapy to suppress the HIV virus and stop its progression. But taking her condition into consideration, it is unlikely that the therapy will start immediately, they said. The baby was given blood transfusion on March 8 after she was found to be suffering from anaemia. As her condition did not improve doctors conducted tests and found that she was HIV positive. The girl was tested HIV positive at a private hospital at Kothapet about four days after she was admitted with pneumonia. As they were not sure, they wanted to carry out fresh tests."

The latter are still treated like pariahs and shown the door even at government hospitals. Last week, a 35-year-old HIV-positive vegetable vendor was turned out of RG Kar Hospital and asked to seek treatment elsewhere. A day earlier, he had been referred to the hospital by Calcutta Medical College, which said it did not have the facilities to treat him. Also suffering from HIV-induced oral cancer, Mohammed Tariq (name changed) is now under treatment at a private hospital where he received his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday, which happened to be World Health Day. Having contracted the deadly virus two years ago, Tariq was under treatment at the School of Tropical Medicine (STM). He was on anti retro-virus therapy drugs supplied by the STM. In January, Tariq developed a cancerous ulcer near the tongue which got infected. Doctors believe it was triggered by the HIV. When he sought treatment for the ulcer at Calcutta Medical College, he was promptly referred to RG Kar Hospital. Last Monday, Tariq went to the emergency department of RG Kar. He says he was shunted around from the oncology department to the surgery section and finally to the hospital's HIV division. ""After two days, I was asked to resume treatment for HIV, even though I had visited the hospital for my mouth ulcer. They said it won't be of any use till my HIV was controlled. When I asked if I could continue treatment at the hospital, they refused and asked me to leave,"" said Tariq, a resident of Rajabazar. In immense pain and barely able to speak, Tariq was taken to a private hospital by neighbours on Wednesday. He received blood transfusion at the hospital and got his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday. Doctors said his oral cancer needs greater attention now, for his HIV is under control. ""HIV might have triggered the oral cancer. Often, it causes lymphoma, oral cancer or cancer in the genitals. But contrary to what he was told at the government hospital, Tariq's ulcer needs to be treated now. It seems he was shooed away due to his HIV status,"" said Ashish Mukhopadhyay, who is treating him. Although his condition was serious, Tariq was still in a state to receive palliative therapy that could keep him reasonably healthy for a few more years, he added. Deserted by his wife, Tariq is now looked after by his two brothers. He has not been able to work for the last six months. ""With each passing month, he has been getting weaker. As if the HIV was not bad enough, he got oral cancer six months ago. The pain has been excruciating and he has barely been able to eat. But the treatment at the government hospitals was shocking. They just refused to treat him,"" said Mohammed Moin, his brother-in-law. RG Kar authorities, on the other hand, argued that HIV-positive patients are often asked to continue treatment for the virus when they seek redress for another ailment. ""As the rules say, HIV patients are treated on a par with others. We are not permitted to disclose their HIV status even to the hospital staff. But we must handle them carefully, for they are carrying a contagious virus. So, we often advise them to make sure that they continue their treatment for HIV and are referred to our HIV centre. Strangely, patients often take this as refusal. I am not aware of Tariq's case, but it seems unlikely that he was shooed away just because he had the disease. At any given point of time, RG Kar has at least 8 to 10 HIV patients who are being treated alongside the rest,"" said Ajoy Ray, medical superintendent of RG Kar. The West Bengal Aids Control and Prevention Society said it was illegal to either refuse treatment or turn away an HIV patient. ""In case we receive a complaint, we shall investigate the matter,"" said Himadri Sekhar Sanyal, the deputy project manager of the society. Mukhopadhyay pointed out that while Tariq needed to carry on his HIV treatment, his oral cancer (buccalmucosa carcinoma) was worsening and might have caused death. ""Without chemotherapy, he wouldn't have survived more than a few months more,"" he said."

The victims say DM Sanjay Bansal was sitting in his car a few metres away when the assault happened but he denies this. The two had to be hospitalized for their injuries but the police seemed to be going slow in the case. Till late Monday, officers refused to answer on what charges the accused policemen had been booked, if at all. Sources say two accused cops have been taken off guard duty on the initiative of the DM. The victims are members of the Peoples Network for HIV-Positive, which is holding its statewide convention at Kolkata’s Esplanade on April 20. They were pasting posters for the rally on a lamppost outside the DM’s bungalow when Bansal’s car rolled in around 1.30pm. “Two of the bodyguards got out of the car and started threatening us. They shoved us around and tried to tear off the posters. When we protested, they started kicking and punching us. They beat us with lathis. We were bleeding profusely,” one of the victims told TOI from his hospital bed. The organization’s district president, Samir Biswas, said: “The two sustained multiple injuries and our members admitted them to hospital. We filed a complaint at the Barasat police station, but we don’t know the names of the security guards. We hope the police can identify them and arrest them.” Bansal claimed that he was “not aware” of the incident and came to know of it after the complaint was lodged. He promised a fair probe but added that there was a restriction on putting up posters or defacing government property around the DM’s bungalow. According to sources, a departmental enquiry has been started against the two security guards and they have been withdrawn from the DM’s protection detail."

The number of HIV positive cases has come down drastically in the district due to awareness among people. Prevention of Parent to Children Transmission Programme has yielded good results. The government introduced free bus travel for HIV positive patients three months ago. Once in a month, the dependents of those below 18 and above 60 can also travel free in buses to ART centres to buy medicines. In the past three years, the HIV positive cases have come down in both pregnant women and the public. Among 75,424 tested pregnant women, 457 tested positive in the period April 2009 to March 2010 while in April 2010 to March 2011, among 73,118 women tested, 312 cases were found positive. In the period April 2011 to March 2012, 1,23,857 women underwent HIV test, and 262 were found positive while during April 2012 to February 2013, 82,613 were tested and 167 found positive. Among general public, from April 2011 to March 2012, among 1,02,493 people, 4,453 tested positive while from April 2012 to February 2013, of the 91,154 people who underwent test, 3,135 were found positive. Dr Balakrishna N Tukkar of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit, Belgaum district, said: ""Thanks to awareness, pregnant women come voluntarily for the test now, which was not the case six to seven years back. With the help of central and state governments and with the support from NGOs, we conducted various awareness programmes like street plays, counselling of sex workers and competitions in schools and colleges. Once the patients are tested HIV positive, we conduct pre- and post- counselling. There are five ART centres in Belgaum district, each in Belgaum, Savadatti, Chikkodi, Athani and Gokak taluk. Patiensts are given free tablets at these centres.'' He added: ""After the government launched the Parent to Children Transmission Programme in 2006, the number of children succumbing to HIV positive due to mother has come down drastically. Under this programme, anti-retroviral tablets are given to pregnant women who are tested HIV positive from their fourth month of pregnancy. Through this, even if a mother is HIV positive, the baby will not get it.'' The NGOs also play a pivotal role. They keep track of the patients. If they discontinue tablets, they counsel them and get them to ART Centre and give the tablets."

Authorities at Goa Medical College and Hospital's anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre have drawn a blank as to the source of infection as none of the children have had any blood transfusion. Sources suspect the children may have fallen prey to sexual exploitation. A counselor who handled the case of a girl whose HIV status was established at the age of nine, said sessions with the girl and her parents were inconclusive as to the source of infection. Both parents tested negative for HIV. ""The mother told me she never left her daughter in the company of strangers. The girl has now turned 13 and is taking ART treatment,"" the counselor said. The counselor was also not able to get any information from the girl on any sexual exposure. In two other similar cases, parents were found to be negative. One of the boys was raped by a person who was HIV positive. ""It was a medico-legal case and it was established that boy had been raped,"" the counselor said. In the other case of any infected male child counselors reached a dead end as neither are parents infected nor did medical history reveal any blood transfusion. ""We suspect he must have been sexually exploited as we don't see any other way how he could have got the infection at this young age,"" the counselor said. A few months back another case was referred to the ART counselor wherein a 13 year-old-girl was raped by a HIV infected person. Though her first test was negative, her status will be known only after the window the period is over. Presently, over 200 HIV positive children who were infected a birth by their parents are receiving ART in GMC's ART centre. Senior medical officer Dr Vanda Viegas told TOI doctors have to encourage parents to ensure that the children are brought for treatment on time. ""The tendency is to wait till the child falls really ill. Children are more vulnerable to opportunistic infections,"" Viegas said. ART consists of a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs that help to significantly restrain the HIV virus and stop its progression."

CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that fights infection. For HIV+ persons, CD4 count indicates the stage of infection, response to treatment and guides drug choices.

""Majority of the HIV patients belong to the BPL category and cannot afford to get their CD4 count done in a private laboratory,"" said Dr Rita Sahoo, project coordinator of Utkal Sevak Samaj, an NGO. Authorities said the hospital had exhausted the chemical reagents used in CD4 machine and measures are being taken to make it functional. ""The chemical reagent is provided by Odisha State AIDS Control Society (OSACS). We have written several letters to the OSACS and they assured us that we will get the reagents very soon,"" said superintendent of SCB Dr Shyama Kanungo."

From now on the new passes for concession that will be issued to people living with HIV (PLHIV), the Corporation will not mention HIV category in them. In this regard The Times of India on December 1, 2012, had published a story 'Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation passes reveal identity of HIV patients'. But now the decision has been taken to keep the identity of the patients confidential. The RSRTC is issuing smart cards for all the 34 categories, which could avail the concession facilities while travelling in roadways buses. Vishram Meena, RSRTC executive director said, ""The passes which will be issued to PLHIV, will not have HIV written in them. In all the passes, the category of the persons availing the benefit will be mentioned on the smart cards, but in case of PLHIV, there will be no mention of HIV in the smart cards."" Moreover, the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) claimed that one PLHIV needs to travel for around 18 times per year to get medicines between Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centers and the patient's home. The RSRTC provides 75% concession on fare for travel. At the ART centers, the PLHIV get medicines free of cost that are provided by the RSACS. A person with HIV said, ""There are incidences when our identity is revealed. The conductors also inquire a lot when they see HIV written on the card."" On one occasion, the RSRTC suspended one conductor for disclosing the identity of the PLHIV. The patient added that now if the RSRTC has decided not to disclose the identity of the PLHIV the people like her welcome the step. In Rajasthan, there are at least 14,000 PLHIV, who visit ART centers for medicines every month. "
33,4,2013,​Drug sent to brain for more effective HIV treatment,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Drug-sent-to-brain-for-more-effective-HIV-treatment/articleshow/19670857.cms,"WASHINGTON: Researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, have developed a revolutionary new technique to deliver and fully release an anti-HIV drug into the brain. Scientists from Florida International University’s Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine devised a new nanotechnique that can deliver and release AZTTP into the brain. Madhavan Nair and Sakhrat Khizroev of the HWCOM’s department of immunology , used magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs) to cross the blood-brain barrier and send a significantly increased level of AZTTP — up to 97% more — to HIV-infected cells. The blood-brain barrier keeps most medicines from reaching the brain. Most antiretroviral therapies used to treat HIV are deposited in the liver, lungs and other organs before they reach the brain. “This allows HIV to lurk unchecked ,” said Nair. This new method could help patients suffering from deseases such as Alzheimer’s , Parkinson’s and epilepsy."

In the last six years, as per official data, Burhanpur has 757 HIV+ patients. Officials from the Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (MPSACS) says that due to availability of testing centres (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres) in these vulnerable districts number of cases have come forth, but voluntary organisations working on HIV/AIDS admit that Burhanpur has emerged as one of the HIV+ centric district due to varied reasons. According to an official from Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (MPSACS), speaking on the condition of anonymity told that according to a surveillance report in 2010-11 it was found that more testing centres were required in the region, including district Burhanpur. ""Focus of National AIDS Control Society (NACO) over many years was on southern states, but in the last two years, northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, MP and Delhi have been provided ample resources to set up new ICTC and Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) centres. We have set up an ART centre in Burhanpur last month,"" added sources. Program officer associated with a voluntary organisation working in Burhanpur told that of the total number of 634 HIV+ patients registered with them in the last six years, around 405 are from Burhanpur and that they actively run awareness programme in the region. The officer cites migration from bordering state Maharashtra and prevalent sex workers in the district as key reason for more number of HIV+ patients. According to an official working in one of the government testing centres in Burhanpur told that though the red light area that existed for years was closed down by the government three years ago, around 300-400 sex workers are still allegedly working and with migration from Maharasthra, HIV+ cases are rising. Nodal officer for AIDS in Burhanpur Dr Harsha Verma however, said that positivity ratio in the district is low as compared to Dewas, Indore, Ujjain and Hoshangabad. ""If you see the number of positive patients, with rising number of people coming for testing, number of positive patients is lowering. In 2012, out of 7,445 tests, 89 tested positive,"" he added."

Sister Britto, the director of Snehadeep Centre of the Holy Cross Community Care Centre and Hospital, over 15 km from Hazaribag, said the they provided medicines, food and accommodation to 40 to 50 patients suffering from HIV. ""But now, we have been compelled to withdraw the facilities as the Naco felt all such patients should go to the ART Centre functioning on the Sadar Hospital campus."" The funds provided by the Naco up to March 31 have stopped, she said. More than 90% HIV patients admitted to the centre were discharged as there was no money to meet the expenses of the patients. Since the treatment facility started in 2005, the centre has treated 3,431 patients. However, the Holy Cross Society has started taking care of poor and critical patients by meeting 50% of the expenses incurred on these patients on humanitarian grounds. The remaining 50% of the expenses are met by the suffering patients with great difficulties. Sister Britto said despite some assistance from the Society, they were compelled to release two doctors and seven nurses whose salaries were paid from the funds provided by the Naco. The number of HIV patients in Hazaribag district has gone up to 1,799. ''We bear 50% of the costs ourselves here since the care and treatment they receive were unparalleled,"" said a patient from Barkatha and Koderma. Sister Britto said, ''We are running 11 centres in Hazaribag and Koderma districts for creating awareness against HIV/Aids and its implication. In all these centres, counseling of people is being done."" Asked whether she approached the Jharkhand government for assistance following this crisis, she said she met principal secretary, health, K Vidyasagar, North Chotonagpur divisional commissioner Nitin Madan Kulkarni and others to acquaint them with the problem.

Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the Hindu Marriage Act came into existence, HIV was not heard of. However, as per Section 13(v) of the Act if a spouse is suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form, it is a valid ground for divorce, he said. Justice Ramanathan, noting that he had perused materials available on the internet, concluded that HIV infection being a communicable health hazard, a person testing positive for the virus should be considered an acceptable ground for divorce. “In the year 1955, HIV was not heard of and, therefore, it was not named in the Hindu Marriage Act as one of the grounds for dissolution of marriage. But having regard for the fact that venereal disease in a communicable form has been mentioned as one of the grounds for divorce, any such disease will also come under the provision of the Section 13(v). Therefore, it cannot be contended that HIV-positive condition is not included under the section and therefore divorce cannot be granted,” Justice Ramanathan said. The matter relates to the matrimonial dispute between the couple from Sankagiri in Salem district. On an application from Ravikumar, a sub-court dissolved their marriage on April 3, 2007. However, hearing the appeal filed by his wife, the additional district court in Salem on January 31, 2008 ruled that divorce cannot be granted. Ravikumar then approached the high court. When the matter was taken up for hearing, his wife’s counsel denied that she was HIV-positive and argued that since her husband was a driver visiting various places during his duty, if at all she is afflicted with HIV, she must have got it only through her husband. While the Hindu Marriage Act had specifically stated that venereal diseases in a communicable form could be a ground for divorce, it had not said anywhere that HIV-positive condition could be a ground for dissolution of a marriage. The divorce plea of Ravikumar, therefore, is not maintainable, she submitted. However, when the court asked the couple to undergo tests at the Government General Hospital in Chennai, Ravikumar alone complied with the order. His wife refused to undergo any tests voluntarily, despite two directives from the court. "

Three HIV positive people, who are currently undergoing Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART), have increased their CD4 counts after working out at the gym which Singh runs in Imphal. According to Manipur AIDS Control Society (Macs), the state has over 40,000 people living with AIDS. Viswajit, 37, who has already transformed the lives of a number of drug addicts after they hit his gym, said he will continue with his new mission to keep HIV-positive people hale and hearty. Two days ahead of joining the gym on March 25, Bobby, Rajenlung and Raja from Imphal had CD4 counts of 168, 184 and 876 respectively. ""After working out at the gym for one month under strict guidance including dietary norms, their CD4 counts have increased. Now, Bobby's CD4 count is 425, Rajenlung (278) and Raja (899),"" said Viswajit at a media conference at his gym on Monday afternoon. ""This is one of our greatest achievements in helping HIV positive people to lead a healthy and dignified life. We will continue this mission to ensure that more and more HIV positive people join us to build a healthy society,"" said the fitness trainer. Chandel Autonomous District Council medial officer Kh Nabakishore Singh, who is the health adviser to Viswajit's gym, said regular exercise improves function of the muscle mass and bones. A Bharat Ratna awardee, Nabakishore said the increase in CD4 count equally improves a person's health. A few weeks ago, Viswajit donated a set of multi-gymnasium equipment specially designed by him for the blind to the state-run Ideal Blind School at Takyelpat here. Last year, he donated fitness equipment worth Rs 1 lakh to Saijwa Jail in Imphal where he also trained the inmates."

To begin with, 150 buses operated both by the government and private players in Palakkad, Thrissur and Pathanamthitta districts would run the campaign against HIV. The KSACS selected the three districts to rollout the first phase of the awareness drive due to the high prevalence of HIV. ""This is the first time we would be engaging the public transport system to spread the message against HIV,'' said a KSACS official. The 150 buses would be carrying messages by actor Mohanlal, the brand ambassador of the society. ""The messages will be in different languages so it will help educate people from outside the state,'' said the official. He added that the society would enter into a six-month contract with bus operators in the three districts, and would be extended after reviewing its impact. The KSACS would later extend the campaign in phases to other districts. A sexual health intervention project being carried out in seven districts, and the preliminary findings have revealed high-risk groups among migrant labourers. As many as 11 cases were found positive in Kasaragod alone a year ago. The finding acted as an eye-opener and authorities have been mulling over conducting an exhaustive study and screening of migrants to bring out the real picture. ""The migrants' level of awareness should be improved. We are finding it difficult to reach out to them due to language barriers. Hence we hope that this new mode of campaign could bridge the gap,'' said the official. The KSACS has also initiated talks with the southern railway to replicate the same on trains plying in the state. The society has already been running a campaign on blood donation on trains. Besides buses and trains, the KSACS also has plans to use government establishments in the state to spread awareness on HIV."

In 2005, the 43-year-old autorickshaw driver from Thane was diagnosed as HIV positive, and two years ago, he was also diagnosed with a kidney failure. What ensued was months of suffering. Even as Ashok had to be put on dialysis, none of his family members would come forward to donate a kidney as he was HIV positive. ""Everybody was apprehensive about his condition. We did not even know that giving an organ to him would not affect our health,"" said Ashok's brother, Surya (name changed). ""Finally, I decided to donate my kidney to him,"" said his 53-year-old brother. But when this decision was made, it turned out that Surya could not give his brother the kidney after all. While Ashok's blood group was A negative, Surya's was B positive. It was then that the brothers registered for a kidney swap at the Apex Swap Transplant Registry (ASTR)-a government authorisation committee that provides a platform for kidney patients to find donors with matching blood groups in return of a donor of their own. ""Even within the ASTR, two other families refused to go for the kidney swap with the Damji brothers as Ashok was HIV positive. We were able to convince one couple, who said that it did not matter who they were giving the kidney to, as long as the donor giving the kidney to them was healthy,"" said Dr Rajesh Kumar, who conducted the swap transplants at L H Hiranandani Hospital on May 9. Nagina and Mahendra Singh, the couple who were in need of a kidney, were happy that the swap worked out well. ""When the doctor explained the situation to us, we understood that the HIV infection was not going to affect us. There was thus, no reason for us to refuse the swap,"" said Mahendra, who had also been on dialysis, but could not get a transplant as his blood group was B positive and his wife's was A positive. ""It was the first kidney swap for an HIV positive patient in the city,"" said Dr Kumar, adding that the complications of a transplant increase in such patients. ""The success rate is about 5% less in an HIV patient than a normal patient, as the risk of infection is more. Also, the drug interaction between the transplant medicine and the anti-retroviral therapy drugs also create complications,"" Dr Kumar added. Both Ashok and Mahendra are well on their way to recovery, while the donors have already been discharged from the hospital. "

Volunteers associated with various groups working for HIV+ patients have also confirmed the same. An HIV positive patient said nurses refused to even touch his child who too is HIV positive. The child was also neglected by doctors. Another patient, who visited the hospital last week, said, ""Each time we visit the hospital, one doctor refers us to other. At times, we face highly inhuman behaviour with doctors refusing to even touch us."" Three days ago, a patient had alleged that he was denied proper treatment at the hospital. Later in the day, Burhanpur Network of People Living with HIV AIDS Society president Rukmini Ganguly, who accompanied the patient, was allegedly manhandled by the doctors. In another incident on April 18, patients alleged that they were given wrong dose of HIV medicine from Burhanpur ART centre. Few patients have complained of doctors making derogatory personal remarks too. A volunteer associated with one the NGOs working in Khandwa district said it was only two years ago that delivery of HIV+ women began in Burhanpur. Prior to this, the patients were not even touched. ""On several occasions, HIV+ patients have not been provided with blood required for operation,"" she said. Burhanpur chief medical health officer Dr I L Mehra said they have received the complaint from Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society on the latest incident and have ordered an investigation. He said, ""As and when we receive complaint, we will take cognizance of the situation. At times, volunteers create too much pressure on doctors which creates complication."" Hospital's civil surgeon Dr Zainuddin Bohra said medicines are given as prescribed by the ART centre, Khandwa."
41,5,2013,Hepatitis-B more infectious than HIV-AIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Hepatitis-B-more-infectious-than-HIV-AIDS/articleshow/20129106.cms,"PATNA: Sneha (name changed), 21, was diagnosed with 'jaundice'. After three days of treatment, she lost consciousness and had to be admitted to a hospital, to be diagnosed with deadly 'hepatitis-B'. Her liver had developed cirrhosis and liver transplant was the only remedy. Her parents could hardly afford the costly transplant, and she died on seventh day in the hospital. According to WHO stats, two billion people worldwide have been infected with hepatitis-B virus and about 6 lakh people die every year as a result of hepatitis-B infection. In India, experts say, at least 5% people suffer from hepatitis-B. Hepatitis-B, or the inflammation of liver, is of two types. In the case of acute hepatitis-B, the person's immune system may get rid of it within a period of time. However, the patient is capable of transmitting it to other patients. 'Chronic' hepatitis-B may be a warrant to death if liver becomes cancerous and a liver transplant is not done, said PMCH's medicine HoD Dr J K L Das. The quirky fact about 'carrier' hepatitis is that it remains asymptomatic. ""You may live with it without knowing about it. Until and unless a hepatitis-B test is done or a serious liver ailment occurs, a patient may not come to know about it,"" gastroenterologist Dr BK Chaudhary said and added it might be too late by that time. Jaundice, loss of appetite, vomiting and nausea are common symptoms of hepatitis-B. If anybody is suffering from jaundice, the doctor must get him tested for hepatitis-B. It is also transmitted from mother to child. So doctors advise every pregnant woman to get a hepatitis-B test done. Hepatitis-B is a blood-borne disease. Like HIV, it gets transmitted through sexual intercourse, individual's blood/saliva or reused needles. Unlike hepatitis-A and E, it does not spread through contaminated food or water. Hepatitis-B, which is 50-100 times more infectious than HIV-AIDS, is preventable. ""If a proper vaccination course is given to someone, people develop immunity towards it,"" said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi. There is no age bar to get vaccinated. Normally, one dose of the vaccine costs Rs 200 at private hospitals. Doctors admit vaccination may not develop proper immunity. ""If the vaccine is not of good quality, it may not be of help. It is, therefore, better to get antibodies tested after taking the course of vaccines,"" said another doctor."
42,5,2013,Bihar's HIV narrative in the light of red candles,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Bihars-HIV-narrative-in-the-light-of-red-candles/articleshow/20129123.cms,"PATNA: On Sunday on May 19, 2001, 150 and odd citizens, among whom were Doctors AA Hai, Sita Mukhopadhyay, Sandeep Sen and Dilip Sen, representatives from Kurji Holy Family Hospital, the then head of Unicef Jean Gough, well known educationists Shanker Dutt, Muniba Sami and the cream of the social service sector such as Augustine Veliath, Vandana Nair, Sanat Sinha and Parveen Amanullah, walked from the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir to the JP statue near Gandhi Maidan bearing red candles. It was the city's first ever edition of the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial (IACM). This Sunday evening on May 19, 2013, people from all walks of life will participate in the memorial service, which falls on the third Sunday of May. It is a day dedicated to the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. The lighting of the candle is an important part of the ritual. ""What's the use of lighting a candle?"" scoffed a sit- at- the- computer smart-aleck-Facebook troll. On that hot summer night of 2001, the 'official' HIV figures in Bihar stood at 35 infected and 1 death. That night, in the glow of the red candles, it was revealed that some 900 people had tested positive during the past five years, and this was with data from just Sens' Lab and Kurji Holy Family Hospital. This news appeared widely in the local press. It, of course, embarrassed the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) people who had also come to the 'show', carrying a large BSACS banner. Those red candles flickering in the summer breeze challenged the opaque darkness of ignorance and apathy. A stunned BSACS spokesperson could only say, ""These are not government figures. We don't include data from private hospitals."" The lameness of the retort was self-evident. As a direct consequence, under the leadership of CK Anil, BSACS began improving services and surveillance. When the next IACM was held a year later, BSACS reporting had greatly improved, voluntary counselling and testing centres were being set up, and 1097 HIV/AIDS helplines had been set up. In 2002, the candles brought to light the issues of silence and stigma. They brought to the fore two things: one, that HIV infections were closer to middle class Bihar than reported, and two, that the obsolete Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was obstructing the battle against HIV and AIDS. Giving the keynote address was a young Bihar-born activist lawyer named Aditya Bandhopadhyay, who was defending the workers of the Naz Foundation International (NFI) in Lucknow, who had been arrested for 'abetting unnatural offences' by distributing condoms and running a sexual health and AIDS prevention centre for non-heterosexual males. 'Integration', one of Kolkata's pioneering Queer Rights groups, performed at the Memorial. It was this year that a symbolic 'Reading of the Names' was started: speaking the names of people lost to HIV and AIDS. The list had some 25 names, people lost to AIDS who were close to the participants and organizers. In 2003, the Memorial had its first transgender guest of honour, Lallan Hijra, who introduced into the Bihar HIV AIDS narrative the voices of the marginalized. She spoke of the trauma of accessing medical services of any kind; how 'hijras' were generally treated like dirt by doctors and nurses alike. She said if Bihar opened its eyes to the fact that transgenders would always be there, and let them access education and skills in peace, they wouldn't be a community forced to dance and beg and be vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. Arriving that day to light the Memorial candle were Arif Jafar and Shivananda Khan. Arif Jafar was the person arrested in the NFI Lucknow case, and he spoke of how media insensitivity and sensationalism coupled with misuse of Section 377 by the police would only cripple society further. The candles also shone on another dark corner, the fate of street children. And so on, year after year, aware and concerned citizens come to light candles in the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. We have lit them when Bihar continued to be in denial, hiding under the cloak of being a 'low incidence state', ignoring the stark reality of high migration of labour and the non-availability of testing at district level. We lighted them as realization dawned that Bihar was a 'vulnerable state'. Over the years we have lit candles with sadness as the people lost to AIDS have become familiar, and we have lit them with hope as people with HIV have gained the courage to come out of the darkness of anonymity and speak for themselves. Tonight the candles glow to remind us that HIV is no longer a ticket to death, if only the required ART treatment is made accessible and affordable. They glow to announce that since 2012, we can claim that some 95 children out of every 100 are born HIV free to infected mothers, thanks to the ART regimen for pregnant HIV positive women. They will glow to dispel the myth that HIV is spread through a razor blade. They also light up the fact that there are more than 55,000 HIV positive children, women and men recorded so far in Bihar, and most still face discrimination and stigma. That is why every candle that flickers in the wind is so very important."
43,5,2013,Stigma hides real HIV picture in tribal hamlets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Stigma-hides-real-HIV-picture-in-tribal-hamlets/articleshow/20218761.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Reflecting the lack of awareness among tribals and higher prevalence of stigma and misinformation, very few HIV positive cases are being reported in the Agency areas of the district. As per records, only 60-70 HIV positive people in these tribal areas are living on anti-retroviral drugs (ART), though there are around 8,000 such patients on ART drugs in the entire district. Health officials observed that more number of students and people who plan to marry are voluntarily coming forward for HIV testing in urban areas these days when compared to a few years ago when very few opted for the same either out of fear or due to the stigma attached to the disease. Students account for 25-30% of those who are voluntarily opting for HIV testing now, they said. “Screening for HIV before marriage should be made mandatory to check the spread of the disease. Awareness generation for taking precautions is more important than diagnosis and treatment because it’s a deadly disease and once someone gets affected there’s no cure. Pregnant women are tested but their husbands should also come forward for testing,” said Dr Sarada Bai, gynaecologist, King George Hospital. Nowadays, with improved treatment regime and drugs, risk of vertical transmission from mother to child can also be minimised. But vulnerable or affected people shouldn’t shy away from getting diagnosed and treated as it could spread the disease and risk the lives of others,” said the gynaecologist. “Around a year ago, there were just four testing centres in the Agency areas in Araku, Paderu, Chintapalli, and Munchingput but now 45 primary health centres (PHCs) located in tribal or Agency areas have Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs). They have screening kits, counsellors and lab technicians to detect HIV cases,” said additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Ronanki Ramesh. “Still, very few come for screening because of illiteracy, lack of awareness and stigma. Also, as the migrant population and high risk groups aren’t much in these areas, the incidence of HIV is also below 1% unlike in urban areas where it is 2-3%,” said Ramesh. “We are now focusing on ante-natal women and TB patients, as they are the HIV vulnerable group in tribal areas, and are also undertaking screening of husbands. In Paderu region, 30 people were put on ART, while the figure is even less in other Agency areas that have a total of 30-40 people on ART drugs. As for the urban areas, the number of HIV cases put on ART is as high as 8,000,” said Ramesh. “However, the overall incidence is coming down. Five to six years ago, there used to be 7-8 HIV positive cases for every 100 persons in the high-risk groups which has now come down to 2 or 3. High-risk groups include sex workers, truckers, migrant population, transgender and gays,” said Ramesh. “There also seems to be a change in the mindset of the youth and student community especially after red ribbon campaigns were launched in colleges. Those planning to get married or donate blood are coming forward for HIV testing in the three ART centres in King George Hospital (the nodal centre), Anakapalle and Chest Hospital. Earlier, they might have indulged in unsafe sex out of curiosity or peer pressure but don’t want to take the risk now. They are given counselling and asked to practise safe sex,” said Ramesh. P Jaikanth, an engineering graduate, welcomed this gradual change in the mindset among the youth. “Of late I see some of my acquaintances going on their own for HIV tests before marriage, which is a responsible behaviour on their part. But a lot needs to change where the stigma is concerned. HIV positive people shouldn’t be ostracized and society should take a live-and-let-live attitude towards HIV positive people,” he said. "

She was transfused blood twice between December 2012 and February this year at a private nursing home in Kothapet, Guntur, but the donors, one being her father, had tested negative for HIV/AIDS. After the blood transfusion in February this year, investigations done at the same nursing home revealed that she was HIV positive. Subsequently, Kavya's parents suspected that the nursing home transfused HIV infected blood and lodged a complaint with the police. But with doubts rising over whether the couple claiming to be her parents are the biological parents or not, a paternity test is also being done at a Hyderabad-based centre and the results are awaited. On Tuesday, authorities at Government General Hospital, Guntur, wrote a letter to the district collector to make arrangements for shifting the girl to Niloufer Hospital. Hospital authorities said that Kavya is losing weight rapidly and needs a better treatment facility. ""Her weight at the time of admission a couple of months ago was 6.8 kg and has now reduced to 5.5 kg,"" said a doctor. While doctors said that she is being treated for HIV with anti retroviral therapy being initiated recently, there is little or no improvement in her condition. ""The district authorities will have to arrange an ambulance to shift her. Her prognosis continues to be guarded,"" the doctor added."
46,5,2013,"HIV deciphered, scientists hope to find its weakness",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/HIV-deciphered-scientists-hope-to-find-its-weakness/articleshow/20355508.cms,"LONDON: Scientists have for the first time peeled open the virus — that can lead to AIDS — from its shell raising giving a priceless insight into how it can be stopped from infecting millions across the globe every year. A team of researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have announced that they have peeled open HIV's outer coating and discovered 4-million-atom structure inside the protein shell. The findings, researchers say will ultimately lead the way to fending off an often-changing virus that has been very hard to conquer. It's been 30 years since the AIDS epidemic spread to every corner of the world killing nearly 30 million people, infecting more than 60 million. There is still no vaccine or cure for it Scientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced. One of the main reason for this is that HIV is an incredibly elusive virus. HIV is among the most mutating viruses. Scientists have long struggled to decipher how the HIV capsid shell is chemically put together. Senior author Peijun Zhang, department of structural biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine said, ""The capsid is critically important for HIV replication, so knowing its structure in detail could lead us to new drugs that can treat or prevent the infection,"" she said. ""This approach has the potential to be a powerful alternative to our current HIV therapies, which work by targeting certain enzymes, but drug resistance is an enormous challenge due to the virus' high mutation rate."" Previous research has shown that the cone-shaped shell is composed of identical capsid proteins linked together in a complex lattice. But the shell is non-uniform and asymmetrical; uncertainty remained about the exact number of proteins involved and how the hexagons of six protein subunits and pentagons of five subunits are joined. Standard structural biology methods to decipher the molecular architecture were insufficient because they rely on averaged data, collected on samples of pieces of the highly variable capsid to identify how these pieces tend to go together. ""The capsid is very sensitive to mutation, so if we can disrupt those interfaces, we could interfere with capsid function,"" Dr Zhang said. ""The capsid has to remain intact to protect the HIV genome and get it into the human cell, but once inside it has to come apart to release its content so that the virus can replicate. Developing drugs that cause capsid dysfunction by preventing its assembly or disassembly might stop the virus from reproducing."" ""By using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, this team of investigators has produced a clearer picture of the structure of HIV's protective covering,"" said the National Institutes of Health's Michael Sakalian. ""The new structural details may reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by future therapeutics."""

The scheme was launched by the department of health and family welfare and Karnataka State Aids Prevention Society (KSAPS) in January 2013. Before the launch of this scheme, many poor HIV patients, mainly those residing in rural areas, did not visit ART centres regularly for treatment as they couldn’t afford the travel fare from their homes to the centres. Six ART centres are situated in different parts of DK district, including two centres in Mangalore city. Dr Kishore Kumar, DK district AIDS control officer, told TOI that an average of 60 HIV patients visit each ART centre a day for treatment. There are 1,600 patients registered in ART centres which provide free treatment, he said. Before the travel fare reimbursement fee scheme was introduced, around 20 patients were skipping their regular visits to ART centres every day. But in the past few months, this number has come down to three, he added. “Last year, when we contacted patients about why they weren’t visiting ART centres, they’d say they cannot afford the travel expense,” said Dr Kishore. He said patients who travel from rural areas to ART centres are reimbursed 80 paisa per kilometre to and fro, while patients within city limits are given Rs 40. After undergoing treatment, patients’ travel expenses are reimbursed at the ART centres. Expenses are also reimbursed for one caretaker who accompanies any HIV patients under 10 years or over 60 years of age, said Dr Kishore. Urging patients to make use of the scheme and free treatment, he said they have to visit the centres once a month. Missing out on a monthly visit is dangerous as it could lead to resistance towards the drug.

His abdomen was cut in such a way that his intestines were visible. Immediate medical attention failed to revive him. Police suspect the 46-year-old patient committed suicide. A case of unnatural death was registered and the body sent for autopsy. The patient from Narkeldanga was detected HIV-positive a couple of years ago. For the past eight months, he was undergoing Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) at Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But because of his irregular visits to the hospital for the therapy, his CD4 count dropped drastically following which he was rushed to the medical college last month. The man was taken home after he became stable and admitted to STM two weeks back since he had become anaemic and was suffering from bouts of diarrhoea. The victim's family members said that he would often skip medicines and needed constant monitoring. His son was hence staying with him so that he could be looked after properly. According to the patient's son, he had fed him and given him all necessary medicines before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept thereafter. At 4.30am, he was woken up by a groaning sound and found his father lying on the floor with blood all around. His abdomen was split open and the intestines visible. A knife brought by the son to cut fruits was used to cut open the abdomen, said police. ""Though the doctors attended to him immediately, the patient couldn't be revived as he had lost a lot of blood and the injury was grievous.

A 46-year-old patient was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his hospital cabin in School of Tropical Medicine (STM) on Thursday morning. Though it is suspected as a case of suicide, police has registered a case of unnatural death and sent the body for post mortem. The HIV positive patient from Narkeldanga was getting treatment for a cabin at STM. His son too stayed with him at the same cabin to look after him. On hearing someone groaning in pain at the wee hours the son woke up to find his father lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He alerted the nurses on duty who called in the medical officer.

To the shock of the doctors who rushed in they found the abdomen of the patient slit deep and wide and his intestine had popped out. ""He was attended immediately by our doctors. But the patient had lost so much of blood and the injury was so grievous that he could not revived. He succumbed to the injury about an hour later,"" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal. The patient was detected HIV positive a couple of years ago. He was on ART drugs for about eight months from Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But due to his irregularities in going for the ART his CD 4 count had come down drastically as a result he was rushed to the said hospital about a month ago. He was then discharged after being treated for about a week. His family brought him to STM two weeks ago as he had become anaemic and suffered from bouts of diarrhoea. Family members said that the patient would skip medications if he was not monitored by someone. That is how his son stayed with him in the hospital to look after him. Doctors treating him also said that the patient was depressed and was also suffering from dementia. His condition had started improving slightly in the past one week. A knife brought by the son to cut fruit for the patient was used to cut open the abdomen of the patient. Police suspects that he was unable to bear with sufferings and hence took his own life.

53,6,2013,Chennai-Yale study pitches for universal HIV test to cut cost,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Chennai-Yale-study-pitches-for-universal-HIV-test-to-cut-cost/articleshow/20549282.cms,"LONDON: Testing every person in India’s billion plus population for HIV will be cost effective, the first ever study on the benefit of universal HIV testing has found. A team of researchers from YRG Care in Chennai, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brown, Yale and Harvard universities in the US has determined that providing universal HIV testing every five years would be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic. The finding was published on Tuesday in the journal PLoS One. Testing the general population just once would cost $1,100 (approx 65,000) per year of life saved (YLS) in the general population, and $800 (47,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Testing the population every five years would cost $1,900 (1.1lakh) per YLS saved in for the general public, and $1,300 (76,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Researchers said the main benefit of national testing would be getting more people to learn they are positive and therefore to seek effective care. A secondary benefit would be to curb transmission of the virus. According to the team, the main results are projections of the dollar cost per year of extended life. The World Health Organization’s standard for cost effectiveness is an expenditure that is less than three times the per capita GDP of a country. In India in 2010, per capita GDP was $1,300. A programme is therefore cost-effective in India if the expense is less than $3,900 (2.2lakh) to save a year of someone’s life. They calculated that modern antiretroviral therapies can give HIV-positive people a normal lifespan. In India, which has a thriving generic pharmaceutical sector, first-line therapy costs only $8.61 (500) a month. HIV tests cost only $3.33 (195). The team coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18%), how many patients who test positive would get care (50%), the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29%) and others. Jessica Becker of Yale University said, “We were able to show that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care significantly, testing this frequently was reasonable.” Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, said the projections will help the country in its battle with the epidemic. “As India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections, expanding testing will be a priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,” she said.

These families have children who don’t carry the burden of their parents’ disease. Savita, a nurse and her builder Rajesh have not allowed HIV infection to derail their lives. The two met in the waiting room of their doctor after being infected, liked each other and got married. The balance tipped in their favor when they gave birth to a daughter who tested HIV negative. “We are elated. A healthy child has made me forget all the wrongs that happened to me,” Savita said. For thousands struggling with HIV, hope is being delivered through the 'Gujarat Mother to Child HIV Prevention' programme run by a group of doctors in Ahmedabad. Of the 200 babies of HIV-positive couples they have delivered, 198 are negative and healthy. Gynecologist Dr Riddhi Shukla says that with HIV gaining acceptability, some partners have chosen to stay with their spouses despite the infection. Artificial insemination methods like intra uterine insemination where the sperm is laboratory washed is used. IVF can also be done but is still not very popular. “The sperm itself does not carry the virus but is present in the seminal fluid. Once it is washed, it becomes safe. Moreover, the mother is put on Anti Retroviral Therapy from the fourth month till the child is delivered. If the CD 4 count, which is an indicator for high infection, is low ART is started before conception as well,” Shukla said. Infectious diseases consultant Dr Atul Patel and paediatrician Dr Rakesh Sharma are also part of the programme. “Once the child is born, he or she is given ART syrup for one-and-half months,” Sharma said. “A few years ago, couples would come to us stealthily but now we see parents and in-laws tagging along. The stigma is diminishing,” Sharma added. "

Drug users are one of the top three high-risk populations due to sharing of infected needles. The first trial to assess whether preventive treatment with HIV drugs could affect rates of infection in people who inject drugs has found that daily tablets of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir), an anti-retroviral drug, reduced HIV incidence by nearly half (48.9%) compared to a placebo, according to results published in the medical journal The Lancet. A team of researchers led by Kachit Choopanya and Michael Martin, chief of clinical research for Thailand's ministry of public health, recruited over 2,400 participants at 17 drug treatment clinics in Thailand. Around half of the participants were assigned a daily oral dose of tenofovir, while the rest were given a placebo. All trial participants were offered monthly HIV testing and risk-reduction counseling and services, plus access to drug rehabilitation treatment. Participants were followed for an average of four years. Overall, 17 participants in the tenofovir group became infected with HIV, compared to 33 in the placebo group, indicating a reduction in HIV risk by 48.9%. Further analysis showed that the protective effect of the antivirals was highest where participants adhered closely to the prescribed regime, reaching more than 70% in this subgroup. Previous studies have established that pre-exposure prophylaxis effectively reduces sexual transmission of HIV in both heterosexual couples and men who have sex with men, as well as reducing mother to child transmission of HIV.

The union ministry for health and the family welfare department along with the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) formed an expert committee to look into the issue. This was on the basis of a Gujarat High Court order passed on November 8 last year in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) demanding that the PCR test or the Nucleic Acid Amblification Test (NAAT) should be made mandatory in lieu of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for detection of HIV infection. The PIL argued that the PCR test reduces the 'window period,' that is, the time period the body takes to produce antibodies in response to HIV infection, also the time period during which the HIV virus is undetectable. The committee was asked to recommend the extent to which PCR test should be made mandatory at all licensed blood banks. It submitted its report on Thursday with conclusions and recommendations. The committee has concluded that the NAAT can at best be an add-on test of HIV screening along with routine mandated antibody screening tests by immunoassay. NAAT is technically demanding and our blood banks are not adequately equipped to carry it out for routine purposes. It also said that NAAT assays may not provide zero risk for acquiring transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) as it does not completely eliminate the window period. After listing out eight reasons why PCR cannot be made mandatory in India, the experts recommended that it should not be made compulsory for all blood banks, since the high turnaround time in screening donated blood may lead to a delay in utilization and may compromise accessibility of blood and blood components. Moreover, its introduction would necessitate amendment in the regulatory framework. The expert group further opined that since there is insufficient data on the additional yield of TTI viral markers as well as operational and technical feasibility in India, selected centres may be identified to conduct this test. A further hearing on this issue will be held next Thursday."

The UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) has now launched an extensive educational and awareness campaign with special attention on migrants. This extensive drive has been launched after five districts of UP including Allahabad, Mau, Deoria, Etawah and Banda were placed under 'category A' in terms of migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons. Subsequently NACO is carrying out a special campaign in identified villages between June 13 and 27. NACO has also decided to carry out fourth phase of AIDS control programme in UP from October this year. According to the report, a total of 183 districts across the nation have been placed under 'category A' by NACO. Nodal officer, DAPCU, Dr OP Shahi told TOI that ""We have been carrying out extensive awareness campaign through 'folk art' to capture people's attention. Folk art like nukkad natak, nautanki, magic show, puppetry and kabbali are the best source of spreading awareness among people."" He further added that under the first phase, awareness and educational camps will be held in 100 villages while remaining villages would be covered under the second phase. Dr Rohit Pandey, district programme manager, AIDS programme said that special camps are being held in 100 identified villages from June 13 to 27 while mass awareness camps in the same villages would be held between June 20 and July 4, 2013. He added that five villages each from 20 blocks of the district have been selected for awareness and educational progammes wherein migrants are being apprised about it too. Even as the officials will be collecting data of number patients from all 20 blocks of the district, they will also be carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment. Meanwhile, they will also be conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV. As far as route of infection and transmission categories are concerned, in 85.3 per cent cases, the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users respectively. Dr Shahi claimed under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities will be identifying those migrant labourers, truckers and homosexuals in the district as they are more vulnerable to the disease. Officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and homosexuals, so that concrete measures can be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus. UPSACS officials have also been conducting awareness programmes under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme."

The donor reportedly did not know until a month ago that he was HIV positive and that he had infected others as well. After the matter came to light, J Saharia, the in-charge of the blood bank at Mangaldai Civil Hospital, where the blood transfusion was done, said the man donated blood twice - in September 2012 and January 2013 - and both times tested negative for HIV. He also said that only two recipients, not five as reported, and the donor tested positive for HIV in recent tests. However, anti-HIV activist and an employee of the State AIDS Control Society, Jahnavi Goswami, who came to know of the incident about 10 days ago, said that five persons in all have been infected due to blood transfusions from this donor and there could be more. ""The woman, who is about 20 years old and the mother of a child, was given blood for pregnancy complications about 18 months ago at Mangaldai Civil Hospital. About six months later she had her blood tested for a skin problem, which is when she was found to be HIV+. She filed an RTI and found out the name of the donor. After this, we tried to get the names of all recipients of the donor. Apart from this woman, I have met another victim and have talked to three other victims on phone,"" she said."

In June 2010, Joan had typhoid and went to her mother's place nearby. Thereafter, Joel stopped calling or receiving her calls. On July 7, 2010, he took her call but told her he would not take her back, without explanation. The medical test report of July 7, 2010 confirmed Joan was cured of typhoid and tests included for HIV antibodies. On July 10, 2010, on reaching her matrimonial home, she found Joel had changed the lock. On October 22, 2010, he filed for divorce alleging impotency/non-consummation of marriage and cruelty. Pending the petition, on March 16, 2011 Joel filed an application praying for direction to Joan to undergo HIV, TB and hepatitis tests along with tests for impotency/failure to consummate the marriage as he suspected she was HIV positive. In his application before the FC, Joel gave many reasons, including fever, tiredness, body ache, dry cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. He said Joan had a bloated abdomen although her face, hands and legs were very thin and due to this she wore long outfits. ""On an official website of HIV, it is documented that HIV is medically caused due to accumulation of fat in the stomach,'' he stated. He said she spoke in her sleep using the words 'HIV' and 'AIDS' and mentioned 'Jack Dorsan', who he found on the Internet was in the prostitution business. He said his wife had stored Dorsan's telephone number and spoke to him on the day of their wedding. He said she applied lip balm five to six times a day ""as the best treatment for Herpes Simplex Virus is keeping the lips moist"". Joan said Joel's suspicion was ""reckless, wild and cruel'' and he himself needed treatment. The FC on May 16, 2012 rejected his application with costs saying, however strong his suspicion, he had to prove the allegations by furnishing evidence so that the court can grant him relief. Joel moved the high court in October 2012. Joan's advocate Mini Mathew argued that the July 7, 2010 report confirming she was cured of typhoid was sufficient to hold that it was not necessary to send her for an HIV test. She said Joel had been spreading rumours about her. ""These allegations are stigmatizing. Her reputation is ruined,'' she said. Joel's advocate Uday Warunjikar said, ""He caught his wife taking HIV medicines. If she is not suffering from HIV, why is she afraid of the test?'' he asked. Justice Dalvi remarked, ""I doubt the marriage can be reconciled. Both sides must move for an amicable settlement.'' She added, ""Why don't you throw her out in a little respectable way? It will boomerang on you.''"

The HIV status came to light on Friday, forcing chief minister Tarun Gogoi to order police to register a criminal case against those responsible for the transfusion. The CM acknowledged that the hospital staff’s negligence had infected the five with the deadly virus after the transfusion of blood from an HIV-positive donor. “This is a criminal negligence. Departmental action like suspending the guilty government official will not suffice. There should be criminal charge against officials found guilty,” Gogoi said. “Only after the inquiry is completed, we will know how many victims have been infected.’’ Gogoi said since the five were infected due to negligence, the government would take complete care of them. He ordered a scrutiny of all 36 private blood banks apart from those in government hospitals to ensure such incidents do not occur again. On Saturday, a team of the health department started its inquiry at the Mangaldai Civil Hospital. The team will submit its report within 72 hours. Residents of Mangaldoi staged a blockade on NH-52 against the state health department and disrupted traffic for several hours. Security forces resorted to lathi charge to clear the highway. Hospital authorities said they only know of two victims, who contracted the infection from the donor. But activist and State AIDS Control Society employee Jahnavi Goswami said five people had been infected and she feared that there could be more. "

Doctors said it is clear now that the child has been infected through blood transfusion. ""It is now proved beyond doubt that the complainants are the biological parents of the baby,"" District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) M Gopi Naik told TOI on Sunday. The controversy has been raging since the past four months when the child was found to be HIV positive at a private hospital where she had been admitted for treatment of pneumonia. Doctors there had used blood from a local blood bank for transfusion when the condition of the child turned critical. But when the baby tested positive for AIDS a week later, the shocked parents approached the police and district authorities. The child was then shifted to the Government General Hospital (GGH) for treatment and cops registered cases against the doctors, promoting several from the medical fraternity to protest. Doctors at the private hospital and officials at the blood bank refuted any culpability. Later, the district collector set up a committee, including DHMP Gopi Naik, which went through the records at the private hospital and blood bank. Reports at the time of the child's birth showed her to be HIV negative. The parents as well as the blood donor, who was traced after the controversy erupted, also tested negative. Meanwhile, the mystery deepened when GGH superintendent Mohan Rao found the records of the child tampered with, marking the baby as HIV positive at the time of birth itself. The government hospital authorities raised suspicion that it was the handiwork of the private hospital management in order to wash their hands off the issue. At this stage, the Indian Medical Association raised doubts whether the parents had adopted the child and sent their samples for a DNA test. Even before the paternity test report came, the district collector handed over the inquiry to the AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS). APSACS joint director Jayachandra Reddy, who conducted an in-camera inquiry with the medical officers, GGH staff and met collector Suresh Kumar on Saturday, said he would submit a report shortly."

He added that the state advocate general has been entrusted to explore the legal options in this regard. Gogoi also announced Rs 5 lakh each for the HIV-infected persons and said that the government would take bear the medical expenses of the victims. BJP, meanwhile, demanded criminal proceedings against the three officials suspended in the case. Mangaldai MP and former BJP president Romen Deka said here on Monday, ""Mere suspension of the officials and conducting an inquiry into the matter will not suffice. It's a criminal offence and criminal proceedings have to be initiated against the officials and staff for neglecting their duties."" On Sunday, the hospital's blood bank in-charge Jiten Saharia and laboratory technicians Ranjit Chandra Deka and Padmadhar Baruah were suspended for negligence of duty. Deka demanded that government should conduct a survey on recipients of blood from the hospital in the district to ascertain the number of people infected with HIV. ""Blood banks and nursing homes are mushrooming in the state. The government should put in place a stringent monitoring mechanism so that such an incident is not repeated,"" he said. The state government has already instituted a one-man commission headed by additional chief secretary P P Varma to probe into the incident. The commission will submit the report within a month. Varma is likely to visit the civil hospital on Tuesday. At least five persons allegedly contracted HIV after they were transfused with blood from an infected donor at the Mangaldai hospital. But, health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told mediapersons that only three persons were infected with HIV. After a team of doctors from the health department submitted its report, Sarma said that of the three, one was a man and two were women. Sarma informed that one of the women took blood from three donors. He also said that blood of all three donors has not yet been tested to ascertain who among them is HIV positive. He said the government would make it mandatory for all blood banks to install double blood-testing centres under close-circuit television surveillance. He said that his department is also thinking of providing two percent job reservations in third and fourth grade posts for the victims of the incident in government hospitals. Meanwhile, a 12-hour Mangaldai bandh called by BJP and Asomiya Yuva Macha completely paralyzed life in the district."

This has led the number of infected thalassemic children to 24. This information was revealed in a status report submitted by CBI to Gujarat high court. This was the fourth report that the probe agency filed in court ever since it was assigned with the investigation on June 27 last year. After going through the report that was submitted in sealed cover, the bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala granted two more months to CBI to probe the issue and come up with another report. The HC handed over the investigation from a Gujarat-cadre IPS officer to CBI, expressing dissatisfaction with the manner the probe was conducted till then. The CBI accordingly lodged a fresh FIR against office bearers of the private blood bank and hospital authorities. While transferring the probe, the judges noticed how former investigator IPS Shobha Bhutada had tried to shield local BJP MLA Mahendra Mashroo by merely recording his statement, whereas allegations were mainly targeted against the blood bank that was illegally operating from the civil hospital campus. Mashroo looks after this private blood bank. In 2011, 23 thalassemic kids in Junagadh district were found to have contracted HIV. The court transferred the probe to CBI after a PIL was filed, and this was the first CBI probe ordered by Gujarat HC in response to a PIL. Ever since HIV infection was detected among children, five kids have reportedly died."

Deputy director of Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) Rajendra Gadhvi landed in the city from Gandhinagar to inquire about the issue. Gadhvi said he has been asked by the senior health officials to take immediate action.

The girl students who were forcibly stopped from attending the primary school in the village have faced social discrimination earlier also. They were forced to move out from their accommodation in Surat city after neighbours took objection. Sarpanch and deputy sarpanch of the village informed TOI that the villagers are not ready to accept that HIV+ girls will study in the school.

All children at Asro are able to get admission in a regular school in the area whereas those under the shelter of NSN have to be content with education imparted within the premises of the center. There are 23 HIV children of various age groups in NSN. All have been able to attend school but not a regular one. There is a open school within the center imparting education to HIV children and slow learners who are also provided care in the center. Sr Philomena of NSN said their children are doing well. The open school works well for them as some of their children do not have any birth records that would have made getting them admitted in a regular school rather difficult. ""We have common class for HIV as well as other children in our care. We receive students from out too,"" she said. When asked why the HIV positive children have not been enrolled in a full time school, she said probably, efforts may have been made in the past but, she does not know much as she was posted in Rivona center recently. Majority of the HIV infected children in the care of the two community care centers are orphans. Few though have parents — both or one of the parents is a HIV positive, and compelled to live in the community care center. ""There are many cases of HIV infected children whose both or one of the parents have died and they have no option but to go to a community care center,"" said a Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) doctor. The anti-retroviral therapy (ART) center in the GMC has about 300 HIV children taking ART treatment. Asro has a total of 34 children, of which one has completed his education and started work. Both care centers allow HIV infected children to stay with them providing them total care until they become self-reliant. One of the HIV inmates of Rivona center has gone back to his mother after completion of his education. ""The boy has got a job and went back to his mother who is also a HIV positive. Two more have completed their education but they are staying with us,"" said Sr Philomena. "
67,6,2013,HIV patients fare better under ASHA care,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-patients-fare-better-under-ASHA-care/articleshow/20739584.cms,"MUMBAI: Here is another feather in the Indian ASHA’s cap. ASHAs or accredited social health activists are not only emerging successful in their intervention in maternal and child health, but new research shows that their care can significantly boost the health of HIV/AIDS patients . Bascially, the ASHAs ensured that HIV-positive patients took their antriretroviral drugs on time, thereby boosting their immune-cell counts. This innovation comes from Andhra Pradesh and the study has been published in two journals, the Western Journal of Nursing Research, and AIDS Education and Prevention. ""For rural women living with AIDS in India, stigma, financial constraints and transportation challenges continue to exist, making lifesaving antiretroviral therapy difficult to obtain,"" said lead researcher Adey Nyamathi from UCLA (University of California - Los Angeles School of Nursing). The study said that 2.47 million people are affected with HIV/AIDS in India, and more than half are women. ``The epidemic is shifting from urban to rural areas, and the rice-producing Andhra Pradesh district in southeastern India is at the epicenter; this area has the highest total number of HIV/AIDS cases of all states in the country, with nearly 20 % of the population infected,’’ said a press release put out by the UCLA. For six months, the ASHAs visited the HIV\AIDS women to help them with medicines as well as to counsel them on ways to cope. They also gave them monthly supplies of high-protein foods, such as black gram and pigeon pea. The study found that group of women who received high-protein foods and counseling were taking medicines regularly and had better CD4+ T-cell levels. These women also had better mechanism to cope with depression as compared to women who didn’t receive support from the ASHAs. The pilot study holds promise for rural women and other populations afflicted by HIV/AIDS, Nyamathi added. "

His grandmother got HIV through blood transfusion in 1980s but at that time, its treatment was a rarity she could hardly afford. His father was born with HIV and spent most of his childhood in hospitals. Dev who was born on May 10, 2013 is now all set to shed the curse of his inheritance as doctors predict that the child will be HIV negative. ""The advance test for HIV will be carried out once he stops breastfeeding at six months. In all likelihood, the child is going to be HIV negative as his mother was on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) and her CD4 count, which is the indicator of her immunity, was very good. While the test will tell for sure, the child is expected to beat the odds"", says Dr Rakesh Sharma, pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases. His father, Ankit Soni has faith that the child will be HIV negative. Soni has been determined to beat his illness, despite having suffered throughout his childhood. ""My mother had got herpes that did not heal. Finally, she tested positive for HIV but in those times, monthly cost of medicines was Rs 25,000. My father was a driver and he could not afford the treatment. My mother died when I was nine"", recalls Ankit. Ankit knew right from his childhood that he was HIV positive. He says that he never hid this fact and people have always treated him well. ""I am fortunate. When I read about 30 girls in Rajkot being prevented from attending school, I feel sorry because my principal had always supported me. My friends too have always stood by my side"", says Soni. Soni studied till class 8 but later dropped out when constant fever, vomiting, TB and other infections kept him in and out of hospitals for six long years. ""In 2006, I was put on free ART medication by Civil Hospital and have been healthy ever since. During these treatments, Soni met Falguni, an HIV positive girl and fell in love. Soni also has her name tattooed on his arms. While planning the baby, the couple ensured that their CD4 count was high enough, so that the HIV virus was not passed on to the child. Soni works as a photographer and supplements his income by running an autorickshaw. He hopes that the doctor's words come true as he wants a healthy baby and also hopes to put an end to his father's sufferings. ""He has dedicated his entire life looking after me. Now I want him to be relieved and happy"", he says. ""The child will be exclusively breastfed for five-odd months and a month later, the HIV test will be carried out"", says Dr Sharma."

The HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2010-11, released recently, showed that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has increased from 0.19% (in 2008-09) to 0.38% in 2010-11. Now, taking note that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS has increased in Rajasthan, the NACO has directed Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), an NGO, which played important role in decreasing HIV/AIDS prevalence in Karnataka to develop ""learning sites"" in Rajasthan so that the programmes of NACO would be implemented in a more effective way. The officials of KHPT were in the city on Wednesday, as a training programme of NGOs by Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) was held. An RSACS official said: ""The KHPT have selected five NGOs which will provide every kind of support by KHPT to develop them as learning sites for other NGOs working in the field of implementing programmes for controlling spread of HIV/AIDS."" Moreover, an 11-member team of RSACS will head for Karnataka on Thursday to share their experience with Karnataka State Aids Control Society (KSACS) and KHPT. Rajasthan is a low HIV/AIDS prevalence state but the slight increase in prevalence of people living with HIV/AIDS has increased worries for the RSACS and NACO. The official said that there are many things which Rajasthan is quite good like care, support and mainstreaming of people living with HIV/AIDS. He said that they would do ""cross-learning"" with Karnataka on implementation of programmes. Earlier, in Karnataka, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS was quite high but later they developed a system with NGOs which helped them in decreasing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Now, all the efforts which Karnataka has done, the RSACS would learn from them and implement it in the state. Rajasthan is low prevalent but it is highly vulnerable because of presence of high risk groups including female sex workers, MSM, truckers, migratory population etc."

Later, he was admitted to Hamidia hospital where his condition is critical. He is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and TB meningitis, a condition which affects central nervous system, said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre in charge Dr Hemant Verma. A resident of Oriya Basti area, he was admitted to intensive care unit of People's medical college hospital on July 1.

Information regarding new guidelines was disseminated among HIV-positive persons by non government organisations at a programme here on Thursday. The guidelines are based on scientific evidence that early initiation of ART can help people with HIV to live longer, healthier lives, and substantially reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others. ""The new recommendations encourage all countries to initiate treatment in adults living with HIV when their specific (CD4) cell count falls to 500 cells per unit or less against the old norm of 350 cells per unit. This is the time the immune system is still strong,"" said Dr BB Rewari from National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). ""The new guidelines offer hope but they will be of use to those in need only when the department responsible for its implementation takes it seriously,"" said Naresh Yadav, President of UP Network of People living with HIV (UPNP+). ""Guidelines cannot save the life of a person, medicines can,"" he added. Naresh also emphasised improving comprehensive and coordinated response to HIV so that the gains of new WHO guidelines can be translated in positive health outcome on the ground. The new recommendations also include providing antiretroviral therapy-irrespective of their CD4 count-to all children with HIV under 5 years of age, all pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV, and to all HIV-positive couples where one partner is uninfected. The WHO continues to recommend that all people with HIV with active tuberculosis (TB) or with hepatitis B disease receive anti-retroviral therapy regardless of their CD4 count. Another new recommendation is to offer all adults starting to take ART the same daily single fixed-dose combination pill. This combination is easier to take and safer than alternative combinations previously recommended and can be used in adults, pregnant women, adolescents and older children."

Following opposition by parents of around 17 students at Amboli village government primary school, the orphaned HIV+ girls could not attend school for almost a month. The district administration has, however, adopted a tough stance and deployed police bandobast at the school premises from Saturday. The girls started going to school last week but due to random demonstration by the parents opposing their presence, they were not attending regularly. From Monday, the girls will attend school in the presence of 10 men and women police personnel outside the school. To give a clear message to the protesting parents, a team of district, panchayat and police officials visited the village on Saturday and decided to take help of police. ""We are going to continue the police bandobast till the villagers continue their protest. Many students wish to study in the school and we are making sure that they are not deprived,"" said J A Patel, deputy superintendent of police, Surat. Earlier, district collectorate and health department conveyed to villagers that their protest was out of place and nothing can stop the girls from studying.

""We have been ordered to make sure that the school should operate. All those who want to study can now go to school and the HIV+ girls will also study in the same school. On Saturday, a group of parents gathered near the school. We warned them of legal action and made sure that the school operates without disturbance,"" said Patel.

Mahajan has years ago, had seven drug-eluting stents fitted in to his heart's arteries in two procedures carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday. Mahajan is possibly the only HIV-positive (human immunodeficiency virus) person who has had so many stents (medical devices made of special metal used to clear blockages in arteries) fitted at the Byculla hospital. ""He has known about his HIV status for years and has been under medication. When he came to us we found that he also has diabetes,"" said Dr N O Bansal, who heads the department of cardiology at JJ Hospital. The public hospital has been operating on HIV-positive persons for the last few years. ""Few hospitals are willing to operate on HIV-positive persons,"" said Dr Bansal. . In fact, JJ Hospital-a centre of excellence for HIV patients -has performed over 1,000 deliveries of mothers who are HIV-positive. While those who are HIV-positive are prone to heart-related ailmentssuch as coronary artery disease, Mahajan's case was more difficult than usual due to the extent of the disease. ""His arteries were thread-like and he had several blockages,'' said Dr Bansal. Mahajan was therefore advised a bypass surgery. ""While we understood that this might have been the best treatment for my heart problems, my family and friends wanted an angioplasty because it would involve no cuts,"" said Mahajan. His father told TOI that his co-conditions such as diabetes, could have made his recovery difficult. recovering a difficult process. But on Thursday, Mahajan said that his chest pain had disappeared. ""I hadn't eaten a meal since I suffered a heart attack on June 26. Now, for the first time since then, I am feeling good,"" he said. His stents alone cost Rs 5.75 lakh. ""Mahajan's experience shows that there is nothing like a hopeless patient. Patients with complex heart disease, too can have a non-surgical option,'' said Dr Bansal. Doctors said that Mahajan was doing well. They said that although his heart's pumping capacity had reduced a great deal after the attack, it would improve significantly over the next six to eight weeks. We have improved both the quality and quantity of life for the patient,'' added Dr Bansal."

The donors were in for a rude shock when hospital authorities tested blood samples of 40 persons and declared them positive. As HIV testing is mandatory before taking blood from donors, nearly 40 donors has come to the hospital on Thursday but when they underwent the test, the faulty testing kits concluded that they were infected with HIV virus. However, the matter came to light on Friday. ""We had come here to donate blood voluntarily but the blood report was demoralising. Though the hospital staff admitted mistake due to faulty kits, such incidences will hold people to come forth for blood donation,"" a donor Rakesh Goswami said. As soon as the news related to the blood report spread in the hospital, the staff rechecked the blood samples in haste with new kits, which turned out negative and came as a relief for the patients as well as hospital staff. Blood bank in charge, Dinesh Acharya, said, ""We had reported faulty HIV testing kits on July 5 but it went unnoticed. The kits had a manufacturing date of July 12, 2012 and were not of good standard. They should be banned.""

I had lost interest in life after being deserted by my ex-husband for my HIV status. I had never imagined life can start afresh,"" said the 23-year-old bride from Khurda district. The woman's earlier marital life was shattered after she contracted HIV. She had undergone the test at Capital Hospital in April, 2012 when her infant daughter's intermittent fever didn't subside. When she tested positive, her then husband abandoned her and their daughter at the hospital bed. ""The baby died within a few days and we got divorced,"" the woman said. She had been given two units of blood at Khurda district hospital in 2011, which seems to be the source of her HIV. ""I have moved on after the initial days of frustration,"" said the newlywed who works for an HIV/AIDS project. The groom, who works as a contractor, looked equally elated. ""I am very happy to have got such a life partner. I was earlier apprehensive about my disease after I tested positive around one and half years ago,"" said the 31-year-old groom from Angul district, minutes after the couple took the marriage vows and performed Vedic rituals at a temple. ""My family and well wishers have been very supportive of the marriage,"" he said. Both the man and wife are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the medication HIV+ people get when their CD+ (a blood cell) count becomes low. Kalinga Network of Positive People, an organization of HIV+, played the matchmaker. ""We knew the woman from the time she was deserted by her husband and also the man for past around a year. Both were looking for suitable partners. They liked each other at the very first meeting while their family members consented readily,"" said KNP+ president Pravasini Pradhan.

According to reports, the state chief minister has also sanctioned a sum of Rs 5 lakh for the children which would be handed to them soon. The parents of the teenaged children- Irfan, Adil, Ikhlaq, Moonis and their sister Nishath Bano died of AIDS within a span of two years. The ill-fated children were pushed out of their ancestral house by their uncle who believed they too suffered from the disease. Seeking refuge in a graveyard, the children faced hostile weather conditions and shared a single cot. President, Alliance Club International, Roshan Lal Amar Vaishya who reportedly first came to know about the children's sufferings on July 16 this year said he visited the children at the graveyard the next day and provided them food and clothes. On July 18, Vaishya accompanied by some local social activists met the district magistrate and sought his intervention even as the incident was reported by the media too. ""The children said they were very frightened to sleep inside the graveyard in the night and it was only during the wee hours that they could manage to sleep for 2 to 3 hours. Their uncle had apparently boycotted them fearing that they are also carrying the dreaded HIV virus,"" Vaishya said. DM Vidya Bhushan visited the children on Friday with chief medical officer (CMO) and his team that conducted their medical check up and declared them medically fit with no symptoms of presence of HIV virus, said ADM, City Puneet Shukla while talking to TOI on Friday.

81,7,2013,HIV positive women turn changemakers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-positive-women-turn-changemakers/articleshow/21498490.cms," NEW DELHI: For several years, Asha Jat was just a 27-year-old homemaker from Ajmer who had tested HIV positive and was shunned by society. Then four years ago, she was introduced to a health project that helps HIV positive mothers avail medical assistance for themselves and their child. Now Asha is one of the 25 volunteers for the project in Rajasthan's Ajmer district and has facilitated 102 childbirths of HIV positive women in the last four years. The project titled, Reduction of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV in India: Improving access of Positive Women to Public Health Services (PPTCT), was launched in three states — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan in 2009. ""The project taught me to speak for myself and stand up for my rights,"" says Asha. Funded through European Union and Christian Aid, the project aims to contribute to the National Aids Control Programme—III's overall goal of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic in India. This was to be achieved by providing non–stigmatized PPTCT services through networks and volunteers. According to Asha, before the PPTCT project, women were neither able to access government health services nor opted for hospital deliveries. After the programme began, there has been a definite increase in both accessing services and hospital deliveries. ""More importantly there has been a drop in the number of children that are born HIV positive,"" says Asha, who shared her experiences at a round table meeting in the capital on Tuesday. District government doctors give lists of HIV positive people to PPTCT volunteers to follow-up. ""The project enables a woman or mothers to go to heath services and say ""I am HIV+, my child is negative and I need medical assistance,"" said Akhila Sivdas, executive director, Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) that advocates for informed representation about gender and development issues such as HIV/AIDS, child rights and violence against marginalised groups. The PPTCT project was implemented by the Positive Women's Network (PWN+), a Tamil Nadu Voluntary Health Association (TNVHA), Arogya Agam, Tamil Nadu and Society for People's Action for Development (SPAD), Karnataka. According to Padmavati, president (PWN+) Tamil Nadu, the project is making a big difference in tribal districts such as Nilgris, Theni and Coimbatore. ""In those places the volunteers are literally the lynchpins of the programme. Every village has a volunteer network and the women, though they don't get an honorarium, are happy to work as volunteers because they have had positive children themselves and they do not want others to go through the same experience"". Citing a highpoint of the programme, Padmavati described how a volunteer secured 30 ration cards (a necessary document for securing various government healthcare facilities) from the Coimbatore collector for the HIV+ women of the area in a single day. For Gajalaxmi, Sex Workers Collective from Trichi district, the lack of such documents led to sex workers facing discriminations towards their rights and entitlements. ""If other women have to make two-three visits to avail of an entitlement, a sex worker would have to go 10-12 times. Even today 50% of them do not succeed in getting their entitlements,"" she said. Tracing the journey undertaken by the Christian Aid, EU and four other civil society organizations in extending PPTCT services to positive women, Semeda Steve, programme manager, Christian Aid maintained that since the programme began the response from HIV positive women has gone up from 7% to 93% in intervention areas. On the occasion a report, Standing Shoulder to Shoulder: Documentation of Best Practices (stories from Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Karnataka), was released by Syeda Hameed, member, Planning Commission."

He lives all alone, eats out of a tiffin box and does not trust anybody. The mistrust has become ingrained in him because all his life, Pratik, 13, has seen people close to him leaving him or others shunning him as he was born with HIV. Talking to TOI, Priyam's neighbour said that his father was a sanitary worker who died in his mid-thirties almost a decade back. His wife followed him and the duo left Tara, 7, and Pratik, 4, as orphans around nine years back. ""It was a difficult time for the kids as both were identified as HIV patients. They had contracted the condition from their parents, who were HIV patients. Among their close relatives, the kids had an aunt living in Amraiwadi who did not wish to take them. She used to send ration to the kids and they cooked their own meals,"" says a neighbour. They were attending a school in Sabarmati for free. While the school authorities did not oppose their HIV tag, when the word spread, other kids started maintaining a distance and soon after, they stopped attending school. A number of organizations initially extended a helping hand but the siblings soon realized that they were essentially all alone in this world. Purnima Gupta, assistant director, Childline, told TOI that the organization came to know about the kids a year back when they had already become world-weary. ""Pratik was sent to a hostel for HIV kids at Gandhinagar a year back but he could not settle there and returned home. The teen saw his sister die in May this year and is aware of his eventuality. His defiance might have stemmed from this fact. He keeps fleeing from home whenever somebody approaches him,"" she says. Situation for other kids suffering from HIV is not very different in the state. Gujarat has two hostels for the patients - in Gandhinagar for boys and in Amboli near Surat for girls. Both the facilities have around 35 inmates at any given time. ""I will not blame the kid for the weariness. It is always a dilemma for the patient whether or not to reveal. As an AIDS patient, having five family members including a daughter suffering from the same, I have seen the almost untouchable status of the patients in the society. A doctor who used to treat my daughter refused to touch her once she got to know that she had AIDS. Same is the case with such students in schools. No less than 200 kids are currently studying in various city schools while hiding their HIV status,"" says Jennifer, who works with an NGO to spread awareness about HIV.(Names of all patients have been changed to protect their identities)"

However, the words seem totally meaningless in the world where people discriminate HIV positive people, even in hospitals. The trouble for HIV infected Ram (name changed), about whom TOI reported a week ago, were seemingly endless. There was discrimination in getting medical aid at Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) divisional hospital. Now, the fate of another HIV patient Vishal (name changed) who, incidentally, has been admitted in the adjacent bed, is also the same. Both these patients lay neglected in ward number 2 of divisional hospital. The lack of awareness about the disease has made the hospital staff reluctant to attend these patients. When TOI reported about the discrimination against Ram in the hospital, the chief medical officer (CMO), Dr MP Chaurasia and district magistrate, Pranjal Yadav and the hospital authorities assured to give proper treatment to him. However, six days later, Ram is still in the similar situation. So is the case with Vishal. Both patients are suffering from severe gangrene infection in their legs and hands and have the history of intravenous drug addiction. Since both are HIV infected. But the paramedical staff of the hospital has refused to attend them. ""They do not even touch me, forget bandaging the wounds. My mother gets the cotton and bandage from the nurses and apply it on my leg, she is uneducated and knows nothing about medicines. I feel helpless. I want to die,'' said Ram, his eyes welling up. According to Vishal, his dressing has not been done from the past one week. He gets his dressing done from a private clinic situated outside the hospital after paying Rs 50 every day. The two cannot go to any other hospital for their treatment because both of them come from very weak economic background. The case of these HIV positive patients has only raised question over the implementation of NACO guidelines that clearly says that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with the general patients. There should be no discrimination, the guideline say. It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. In fact the counselors of Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the hospital have also accepted that the hospital staff is not attending the HIV patients properly. The amount of unawareness prevailing in the hospital can be judged from what the para medical staff say. One of them, Saikhu said ""The medical equipments, scissor, knives required for dressing are same for the ward. We cannot use the same equipment to perform dressing on HIV patients. They have separate arrangement at Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU). They can go there"". But the hospital authorities do not accept this. ""Giving separate treatment to HIV patients will lead to discrimination. The patients are treated well and their bandage and dressing is done by the hospital staff only"", said superintendent in chief of the hospital, Dr VK Srivastava. "

According to experts, the HIV positive mothers should exclusively breastfeed their children irrespective of HIV status for the first six months while non-infected mothers can breastfeed till the child reaches two years of age. ""NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months and then soft, nutrient-rich homemade food during the weaning period, preferably upto two years. It has been found that the risk of transmission involved is minimal, just 2%, when the mother is on ARV using a combination drug regime,"" said Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS). ""The child is given nevirapine syrup for six weeks and then septran syrup till the 18th month in case early infant diagnosis or DNA PCR test shows that the child is HIV-negative. In case the child is found to be HIV positive, he or she is put on ARV. WHO (World Health Organisation) recommends alternative or replacement bottle feeding only if five factors are satisfied. These include AFASS - Affordability, Feasibility, Acceptability, Safety and Sustainability,"" said the APSACS official. While breast-feeding is recommended for all newborns, there has been controversy over HIV positive mothers breastfeeding their babies but this has now been dispelled with the WHO and doctors dealing with AIDS recommending breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers who are on ARV even in developing countries. According to Dr K Surya Rao, specialist in HIV/AIDS medicine from Dr Kutikuppala Hospital, one has to weigh the risk and benefits while breastfeeding. ""In India, as per WHO, annually, nearly two-thirds of the over 2.4 million child deaths are related to inappropriate infant feeding practices. Due to lack of breast milk, many infants die of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis overnight. Even though there's some risk of vertical transmission involved, there are ways to prevent it too."" ""The mother should be on highly active ARV right from pregnancy, depending on her viral load and take a combination of drugs instead of the earlier practiced mono-therapy. The mother should also be comfortable feeding the child as per requirement. Also, a campaign needs to be undertaken, especially in rural and tribal areas regarding non-discarding the colostrum, which is a component in the mother's first milk containing high protein and antibody and boosts the immune system,"" Dr Rao explained. Concurring with experts, Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) said, ""Mixed feeding with breast and bottle-milk should be avoided to cut down the risk of transmission. Also, in poor or developing countries, women may not have access to safe and affordable replacement feeding options and handling of milk bottles isn't hygienic and triggers more diarrhoea deaths in infants. Therefore, irrespective of the HIV status, mothers on ARV are encouraged to breastfeed their children within one hour of birth."" According to doctors, breastfeeding is the best way to provide ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants as apart from creating immunity and protecting the baby from infections, it also creates a special bond between the mother and child."

Hospital staff maintains that despite being referred to Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Ram was staying the ward on his free will. Hospital administration is also unable to clarify as to why the patient, who is unable to travel on his own, has not been provided with the ambulance facility for shifting to SSL. Ram has a severe infection in his leg and is unable to move even from his bed. Forty-year-old Ram, who is being nursed by his old mother, says, ""We cannot go to SSL. We have no money or strength to travel."" He had earlier alleged that hospital staff was discriminating against him in providing medical care. He had claimed that the para-medical staff had refused to clean his wound and dress it properly. As a result, her mother was acting as his nurse. The para-medics had claimed that Ram's case was different as he was suffering from HIV infection. ""HIV positive patients have to be attended in a different manner. We don't have any arrangement for taking care of such a patient, hence we are unable to take care of his wound,"" said para-medic Saikhu. The hospital's attitude towards Ram is indicative of the stigma and lack of awareness among the hospital staff regarding HIV. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has clear guidelines that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with general patients and without discrimination. It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. The hospital's silence over not offering any assistance in shifting the patient to BHU is also a major issue. Meanwhile, taking serious note of the reports of discrimination against HIV positive patient, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sought a report from the Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) Divisional Hospital on the issue. Through a letter, the NACO has ordered officials concerned to probe into the matter and submit a report within a week. Accepting that such a letter has been received by the hospital administration, superintendent-in-chief (SIC), SPG Hospital, Dr VK Srivastava said, ""The patient is staying in the hospital on his own free will. He is not ready to shift to the BHU. We have already informed the CMO and the police about it. The hospital staff has never discriminated against the patient. We will submit a report to NACO by Friday."" Meanwhile, the 'Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV' a non-profit organisation run by HIV positive people has also taken the matter seriously. According to Manoj Singh, president, BNPPL, they have filed a detailed report on the discrimination and neglect faced by Ram in the divisional hospital. ""By discharging and referring these two HIV patients, hospital only wants to unburden its load. The hospital lacks proper facilities and there is complete lack of coordination. We have filed a detailed report about these two patients and are sending it to Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS),"" said Manoj."

But now even the common population will be brought in its ambit and free HIV card test will be made available in the remotest PHCs in state. The HIV test, apart from 14 other tests, will be provided free-of-cost at all PHCs from April 15 under the chief minister free diagnostic test scheme phase III. The test is already free at district hospitals and community health centres (CHCs). According to the recently-released HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS), the prevalence of HIV in state increased from 0.19% in 2008-09 to 0.38 in 2011-12. Rajasthan is a low prevalence state but is highly vulnerable due to the presence of high risk groups including female sex workers, injectable drug users, truckers and labourers. Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) project director Dr SS Chauhan said, ""Earlier, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) and RSACS provided free test to high risk groups only.

Moreover, RSACS has set a target to conduct HIV test on all pregnant women, added the official. It is estimated that 19 lakh infants are born every year in Rajasthan. So, by screening pregnant women, transmission of virus from mother to child can be prevented. ""There is 25-30% risk of transmission of virus from infected mother to the baby, but that risk can be minimized by the screening test and by giving medicines to the infected mother,"" he said."
88,8,2013,HIV via blood transfusion on the rise,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/HIV-via-blood-transfusion-on-the-rise/articleshow/21926970.cms,"HYDERABAD: About 571 persons in Andhra Pradesh have been allegedly infected with the HIV virus through blood transfusion in the last four years. Experts attribute such infections to rampant malpractices among blood banks and hasty oversight on the part of the recipient. As per the data available on the occurrence of such cases between 2009 and 2012, in different states across the country, mentioned in the Parliament recently, the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions in Andhra Pradesh was allegedly amongst the highest in India. In the recent past, instances of transfusion of HIV-infected blood were widely reported from Nellore and Warangal. Amongst the southern states, Tamil Nadu did not report any case, while Karnataka recorded 100 such cases more than AP during the same period. Activists working with the people with HIV say the high numbers can be attributed to the demand-supply gap for safe blood. Voluntary blood donations rates are not high while blood banks peddle infected blood, they said. The failure of the government to rein in such malpractices only makes matters worse. In May, this year, an 18-month-old baby Kavya, was detected with HIV AIDS, which doctors suspect occurred from an infected blood transfusion. The news made national headlines, highlighting negligence on the part of authorities. Narendra Revelli of Centre for Advocacy and Research who has been working for a decade with the AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) blames private blood banks. ""It is mandatory to check blood for HIV before it is banked. However, owing to the supply shortage, unauthorized blood banks do not discard infected blood even if it tests HIV-positive. There is no possibility of infection if blood is checked and banked properly,"" he said. Revelli said that banks mostly rely heavily on professional donors who donate blood for money and therefore do it on a weekly basis. ""There are several such donors near the clock tower area in Secunderabad and Nampally where there are many private blood banks,"" he added. Officials of APSACS, however, disputed the numbers stating that blood transfusion is the cause of infection in very few cases. Nevertheless, they did not rule out risks of contracting the virus from blood available at unauthorized blood banks. ""The number of cases in which blood transfusion has been established as the cause for infection is much less. However, it should be noted that there is a risk of infection if blood is procured from unauthorized blood banks where testing for HIV may not be performed,"" said Dr J C Reddy of Integrated Counselling and Testing Services (ICTS) wing at APSACS. The figures quoted in the Parliament are those from ICTSs across the country. Experts also said that the district and state health officials do not supervise blood banks. ""I don't think there has been any change in terms of both blood procurement and voluntary donation which have not improved,"" said Revelli."
89,8,2013,Diabetes has same effect as HIV on tuberculosis,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Diabetes-has-same-effect-as-HIV-on-tuberculosis/articleshow/21928474.cms,"CHENNAI: The combination of diabetes and tuberculosis doesn’t just complicate treatment ; the double disease could be as dangerous as having HIV/AIDS with TB. A new study has confirmed that diabetes can make the TB bacteria harder to treat, just as HIV/AIDS does. A group of doctors from MV Hospital for Diabetes, who pored over records of tuberculosis patients registered in the government’s Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme in Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram , found that at least 50% of TB patients had diabetes or pre-diabetes . All patients were given medication under the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short Course) programme, recommended by World Health Organisation for TB control. At the end of two months, doctors did a sputum test to see if medicines had brought down infection. Nearly 14% of patients with diabetes tested positive for TB compared to 3% of those without diabetes . After six months, doctors said 4% of TBdiabetes patients had not responded to treatment compared to 0.7% of those without diabetes. The effect of diabetes on TB is similar to HIV on TB, said diabetologist Dr Vijay Vishwanathan , who led the research team. They will urge the government to integrate national programmes for TB and diabetes. “We must ensure that all TB patients are tested for diabetes and vice versa,” he said. According to the Union health ministry, 40% of Indians are TB carriers. At least 10% of people in India are diabetic and in cities like Chennai the incidence is 20%. “The chances of TB recurrence are higher among diabetics. We are planning a larger study to determine a new treatment regimen, including better diagnosis methods for TB-diabetes patients,” said Dr Vishwanthan. National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis director Soumya Swaminathan said they did a study among 100 patients with TB and diabetes and found that if sugar levels are under control, treatment outcomes are better. “This hardly happens. TB is diagnosed when patients are in their 40s, the same time when many learn they are diabetics as well,” she said."

The bench of Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala called for strict concealment of the HIV positive person's identity in response to a PIL filed by advocate Vijay Nangesh. The PIL objected to a 2009 incident, at the Guru Gobindsingh Government Hospital in Jamnagar, when a sticker bearing 'HIV positive' was stuck to the forehead of a 25-year-old pregnant woman, and she was paraded in the hospital. Terming the incident unfortunate and in violation of human rights, the court called for more awareness programmes in rural areas so people can use preventive measures. The court also asked for a proper rehabilitation scheme for HIV positive persons and AIDS patients. The court also asked the media to show restraint and not reveal the identity of such patients, as was done in that particular case. Moreover, the court emphasized the education of HIV infected patients that they don't, inadvertently or innocently, be responsible in spreading the disease. The court also observed that normalizing the presence of HIV/AIDS in our society through public education is the only way to reduce discriminatory attitudes and practices."
91,8,2013,"‘Delay in HIV treatment may affect cognition, motor skills’",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Delay-in-HIV-treatment-may-affect-cognition-motor-skills/articleshow/21993237.cms,"PUNE: Performing routine activities like cooking, bathing and walking may become difficult for an HIV-infected person if treatment is delayed, a first of-its-kind study has found. The five-year-long study, conducted by the Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego, found that people with HIV/ AIDS in India are at higher risk of developing milder neuro-cognitive impairment if treatment is not initiated. The study was completed in May this year. The study has indicated a higher baseline prevalence (47%) of neuro-cognitive impairment in people with advanced HIV infection who are yet to take treatment. Neurocognitive impairment affects cognition (thinking), motor control (body movements) and the psychological state of the individual. The world over, people with HIV infection are living longer and having a better quality of life due to greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thanks to ART, HIV induced illnesses like cryptococal meningitis have been on the decline. However, conditions like HIV-associated neuro-cognitive disorder (HAND) are still prevalent. The study also assumes significance as earlier studies in the western world were based on the subtype B virus that causes HIV infection. However, in India, clade C is the most common subtype. Based on its characteristics, clade C has been found to affect an individual’s nervous system less severely than other subtypes. It was milder than the subtype B prevalent in Europe and America, researchers say. “The baseline finding of the study suggests that clinicians and healthcare providers must know if people living with HIV have any difficulties with cognition or performing daily activities. The family members or the caregivers should also be told of such conditions so that they can detect changes in the individual and seek timely advice from healthcare providers,” researcher Manisha Ghate, co-principal investigator of the study, told TOI on Thursday. Ghate said, “The routine activities of HIV-infected people may get affected if they have neuro-cognitive impairment. In milder forms, it may be prominent only while performing complex tasks like calculations and multitasking. But it is pronounced in severe forms like dementia and patients may have difficulty even in performing routine daily activities like cooking, bathing and walking. Cognitive impairment associated with HIV has been correlated with the increased complaints of job performance difficulties and poor medication adherence.” Researcher Sanjay Mehendale, the principal investigator of the study, said, “The beneficial effect of ART has been observed in cognitively impaired individuals. The improvement was seen in the domains of learning, executive functioning and motor performance. This beneficial effect was also observed in cognitively impaired individuals with higher CD4 counts.” Even otherwise, healthy people show neurological decline as they age. “But here we have a younger population infected with HIV, so this effect will be greater as they age. Patients need counselling in addition to ART,” Ghate said. When contacted, NARI director Ramesh Paranjape said, “This is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.” Why the study? People with HIV infection are living longer and better due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy. Though neurological opportunistic infections are on decline, non opportunistic conditions like HIV associated neurocognitive impairment (HAND) remain prevalent. It has been shown that the impaired cognitive performance can affect routine activities, employment, adherence to treatment and quality of life. The studies have been conducted globally, but the data on the prevalence and co-factors associated with HAND available from systematically conducted research in India is scanty. Study details This is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego.The study was initiated in September 2008 and completed recently in May 2013. The study was conducted in adult population above 18 years of age.The data was collected in three groups: 1) HIV infected individuals with advanced disease (CD4 count less than 200 cells/cmm) : [number of patients were 125], 2) HIV infected individuals with CD4 count between 350-550 cells/cmm : [number of patients were 128] and 3) HIV uninfected individuals [number of patients were 287]. All participants received a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, neuromedical assessment and laboratory evaluation.The neuropsychological test battery that was used in this study was developed at HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) San Diego and standardized in Indian population prior to useAfter baseline evaluations, all individuals with CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 received ART treatment as per the national guidelines and nearly 50% HIV individuals with CD4 count between 350 and 550 cells/mm3 were given immediate antiretroviral treatment (they were co enrolled from a ongoing clinical trial). The participants were followed every year for neuropsychological evaluation. The cognitive battery included tests in the domain of fluency, speed of information processing, attention, executive functioning,learning, memory and motor performance. The outcome on ART was evaluated based on the performance in these tests. In the offing Indian Council of Medical Research has organised national seminar on ‘NeuroAIDS in India: Current Findings and Future Directions’ at National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune on September 24 and September 25. (Source: National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune) Key findings of nari study A study has indicated higher baseline prevalence (47%) of neuro cognitive impairment in people with advanced HIV infection who are yet to be put on treatment The most common subtype clade C, which causes HIV infection in India, has been found to affect nervous system less severely than subtypes like subtype B virus prevalent in Europe, America.

Addressing a gathering at a programme organized by the Federation of Education Resource Centres (FERC) to discuss violations of RTE rules by schools in the undivided Dakshina Kannada district he said, ""We are accumulating proofs against the school authorities. Very soon, we will file a complaint against the school and the staff with the department of education. Many schools in the district have no compound walls. A lot of posts of teachers are vacant. About 49% of the schools in the state have toilet that are not functional,"" he said. At the event, Umesh Nirmal, former president of the FERC, alleged that under RTE, free education should be provided to poor children. ""However, some government schools in Bantwal taulk are charging Rs 200 as fee from the students who have joined class VIII. Also there are no computers in many government schools,"" he added. Renni added that proofs collected against schools violating RTE rules will be presented before the elected representatives at a RTE Adalat to be organized by State Commission for Protection of Child Rights in Bangalore on September 5 and 6. When TOI asked about the discrimination faced by four children living with HIV, Nagendra Madhyastha, deputy director of public instructions department, Udupi, said, ""This is a very sensitive issue. We will not reveal the names of students and parents. But will take severe action against the school authorities if we receive any complaint."" N Shivaprakash, deputy project coordinator of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, said that as per the RTE rules mandate compound walls schools situated in urban areas and within the vicinity of highways. ""The government has already sanctioned funds for the purpose,"" he added."

When the police had spotted the boy, he was eating biscuit outside the garden. The boy was brought to Shishu Grah with police help and his complete health check up was done. Shishu Grah superintendent of police Kavita Panwar said, ""We conducted various medical tests at JK Lon hospital on the boy. The report shows that the boy is living with HIV."" Now, the Shishu Grah would conduct proper HIV test at one at the integrated counseling and testing centre to re-confirm that the child is actually living with HIV. Moreover, the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) officials claimed that it is necessary to re-confirm it at one of the ICTC at Sawai Man Singh hospital or at Zanana hospital. The As the boy has been tested positive for HIV, the officials at Shishu Grah have made arrangement for his treatment. ""We are taking care of the boy and he has been admitted to the home,"" Panwar said. tnn Police are investigating the boy's case after registering an FIR against unidentified persons. An official with Gandhi Nagar police station said the parents might have abandoned the boy, but the reason is yet to be ascertained. Investigating officer Bharat Singh said, ""We have lodged an FIR against unidentified persons and an investigation has been launched."" Singh said he did not have any information yet about the child being tested positive for HIV. It is often seen that parents or some other persons abandon a girl or boy soon after its birth as the infant is 'unwanted' due to various reasons. The plight of the boy was that he was abandoned when he needed care and support from his family. Whenever an abandoned boy or girl is found in any part of the city, it is routine for the Shishu Grah in Gandhi Nagar to conduct various health check ups before admitting the abandoned child to the home so that they could take care of health."

Ram was a case of denial and discrimination by the staff of SSPG Hospital. Admitted on bed number 12 of ward number 2 of the hospital, he was suffering from gangrene in his left leg. The patient and was a drug addict. He got HIV infection because of using infected syringe. Ram and his mother had earlier alleged that he was not attendant by the employees of the hospital. His mother used to perform the dressing on his wound and the para-medical staff had refused to attend him, stating that his case was different from others, because of HIV infection. The matter was highlighted by TOI in July and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) sought a report from the hospital administration regarding the patient's condition and lack of sensitisation prevailing among the staffers. Superintendent-in-chief (SIC), SSPG Hospital, Dr VK Srivastava then said, ""The patient is living on his own. He is not ready to go to Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital of BHU, where he was referred. We have given this information to CMO as well as police. The hospital staff had never discriminated in attending the patient."" It may be noted that Ram was not able to walk because of the infection. The hospital administration, which claimed that the patient was referred to BHU, had not provided ambulance or vehicle to help him reach there. ICTC counsellor Manisha, who arranged for the dressing of his wounds and helped his family to get CD4 count tests said that Ram was once befooled by touts in SSL Hospital.

The discovery, which allows for a combination of decitabine and gemcitabine to be delivered in pill form, marks a major step forward in patient feasibility for the drugs, which previously had been available solely via injection or intravenous therapy (IV), researchers said. “If you have a condition that requires you to take a medication everyday, as many patients with HIV do, you wouldn't want to have to take that medication via daily injection ,” said Steven Patterson, professor at the Center for Drug Design at the University of Minnesota. “This finding is a big step in this treatment as it could be taken as a pill, similar to other HIV drugs, and is suitable for eventual clinical translation,” said Patterson. Researchers first announced decitabine and gemcitabine could potentially combine to treat HIV in August 2010. The drug combination was shown to work by lethal mutagenesis that could obliterate HIV by causing the virus to mutate to a point where it was no longer infectious. For some patients, HIV’s ability to quickly mutate and evolve can result in drug resistance, researchers said. "

Every time police cornered Manoj (name changed), an HIV-positive vehicle thief, he showed them his HIV status certificate and escaped after threatening to infect them with a bite. But late last month his luck ran out when he was caught along with his partner Raj Kumar on the way to Meerut. Police say the duo was involved in around 50 cases of vehicle theft and robbery. Their arrest came about as the car they had stolen was equipped with a GPS tracking system. On the morning of August 23, a woman from Saket in south Delhi reported the theft of her Santro car. Inspector Rituraj, whom DCP south PS Kushwah had put in charge of a team to catch vehicle thieves, used her mobile phone to locate the car. The car was in Kaushambi, Ghaziabad at the time. Immediately, a police team accompanied by the woman set off to seize it. When they reached Kaushambi, the accused fled towards Meerut. However, police continued pursuing them and stopped the car as it crossed Ghaziabad. As police surrounded the car and asked the duo to get out, Manoj resorted to his old trick and threatened to bite them. However, the woman distracted him in a conversation and two policemen reached from behind, threw a towel over his face and tied it up, a source said. His hands were also tied up and he was brought back to the police station. A case was registered and the duo was arrested. Both men are in their 50s and live in the Dakshinpuri area of south Delhi, a source said. With their arrest, police claim to have solved around 22 cases of vehicle theft and recovered four cars and two bikes. Investigation is continuing. Police have also informed the jail authorities about the accused and his behavioral pattern. A source said Manoj will be kept separated from the other prisoners in jail. "

Adivision bench of the HC comprising Justice Abhay Oak and Justice Revati Mohite-Dere directed the MSRTC to reinstate the driver within a week and said the issue of compensating him will be decided on September 13 when the matter will be next heard. The MSRTC had removed the driver from service on May 16, 2012. The corporation based its decision on the report of the medical superintendent of the Sassoon general hospital here, submitted a day earlier, which stated that the driver was suffering from “immuno compromise status with peripheral neuropathy without motor deficit” . The report had said he was unfit to work as a driver for heavy vehicles. The driver filed a writ petition on July 25 the same year against the MSRTC and others challenging his suspension. He said the Sassoon medical superintendent had, on February 8, 2012, issued a letter stating that while he was unfit to drive heavy vehicles, he was suitable for light work. Earlier, on September 4, 2009, the medical superintendent had issued a letter that he was fit to work as a driver, the petition stated. In his petition, the driver alleged that he had been removed from service because he was suffering from HIV. He said his salary has been pending with the MSRTC since December 8, 2011. The driver had been diagnosed with HIV in 2008 and has been on anti-retroviral therapy at the Sassoon hospital ever since. The petition also states that there were times when the driver could not report to work because of depression due to the diagnosis and that he has to deal with the misconceptions that society has about the disease. The driver was provided free legal assistance by Sahyog Trust run by lawyer Asim Sarode and his wife. Speaking to TOI, Sarode said, “Removing a person from work because of his/her HIV/AIDS condition is a violation of the right to livelihood and a human rights violation.” Sarode described the HC order as a landmark judgment for persons suffering from such medical conditions in the state. “In the absence of any law to protect such persons from constant discrimination, stigma and exploitation, the HC order is truly constructive and will create a long-lasting impact in creating a rights-based approach of looking at such cases,” he said. Sarode was assisted by lawyers Kiran Kulkarni and Manish Dikshit. "

Her prescription states that the patient was not passing faeces for seven days. She was prescribed medicines and asked to report after a week. The patient on September 2 came back with swelling and acute pain in abdomen. The patient was referred to medical emergency, said Babloo. On consultation in medical emergency, the doctors referred her to surgical emergency. The prescription said, ""The X-ray of the abdomen shows that the patient is having multiple air fluid level."" For performing surgery, a few tests were done, including an HIV test. ""On finding my mother HIV positive, they tore the prescription and asked us to take her to any private hospital,"" said Babloo. Babloo took her mother home but returned to surgical emergency on September 4. ""However, the doctors refused surgery again, saying no doctor will risk his or her own life.

However, PMCH's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said he was not aware of any such order. 	Babloo expressed satisfaction that his mother was allotted a bed on Saturday night, but said at times there was no one to help. ""She was suffering from breathlessness late in the afternoon today and nurses told us to take her to emergency, but there was no one in the ward to take her there,"" he said. "
102,9,2013,HIV positive woman dies at PMCH,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/HIV-positive-woman-dies-at-PMCH/articleshow/22449382.cms," PATNA: The 45-year-old HIV positive woman suffering from intestinal obstruction, who was admitted to the surgical emergency of the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on Thursday, died on Monday evening. Her end came without being operated on and being transfused blood. The woman's relatives had told TOI on Friday that the doctors had refused to operate on her since she was HIV positive. According to her son Babloo, she was taken to emergency from the ward around 11am when there was almost no movement in her. ""We were once told that she has been taken to operation theatre, but the surgery was not performed. Ultimately, at around 3pm, she died."" PMCH's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said the fast deteriorating condition of woman led to her death. Dr J P Gupta, who was treating the woman, could not be contacted after her death. Earlier in the day, Dr Gupta had said the woman did not require an operation. He added the patient was experiencing difficulty in breathing and needed blood transfusion, but her attendants couldn't arrange blood. Babloo said he visited the blood bank many times since Sunday to give replacement blood but could succeed in doing so only on Monday morning. Then too, he could not get blood for her mother. This happened despite a clear order of the health department not to ask for replacement blood from HIV positive people. The PMCH doctors had maintained till Sunday that she had undergone laparotomy (a surgical procedure of abdominal cavity) sometime back, hence she couldn't be operated and was being kept under observation. However, Babloo said on Monday, ""She had not undergone any surgery for the last five years. From denying blood to delaying surgery, it was a conspiracy to buy time and wait for the eventuality."" No post-mortem was performed on her. Some doctors aware of the case said on the condition of anonymity that the surgery might have been risky, but the risk should have been taken. Gyan Ranjan, a member of the governing council of Bihar State AIDS Control Society, said this was not a solitary case of its kind. At least three other HIV positive people had faced similar treatment in the recent months, he said."

The 45-year-old woman died on Monday. A three-member probe team, comprising director-in-chief (health services) Dr Surendra Prasad, Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS)'s project director Dr S K Sinha and an additional secretary-rank health official, visited the hospital on Tuesday and took statements of PMCH blood bank's chief medical officer Dr U P Singh and Dr J P Gupta, who was treating the woman, among others. ""We explained to them that the woman's potassium level had dropped too low and the BP was very high. She also required blood transfusion which couldn't happen. Because of these reasons, the patient couldn't be operated,"" hospital's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak told TOI. The woman's attendant, Babloo, on Monday alleged precious time was lost after she was admitted on Thursday. Her condition deteriorated with the passage of every day. Babloo also alleged harassment at the hands of blood bank officials, saying he was made to run in circles to donate replacement blood even though the state government has ordered not to seek replacement blood from HIV+ patients. After the woman's death on Monday, at least two HIV+ patients came forward, alleging apathy at the hands of the PMCH doctors. A 25-year-old from Barh has his bone below the knee fractured. ""It was plastered, but it didn't heal. I was referred to PMCH which, in turn, referred me to ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre,"" he said. Incidentally, ART centres are units which distribute medicines for slowing down the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Barh patient said he confronted the PMCH superintendent, asking how the ART centre would treat him. The superintendent on July 29 wrote on his prescription, ""The patient is already registered with the ART centre of Rajendra Memorial Research Institute since November 9, 2010. Presently the patient has developed distal tibia. (He) needs orthopaedic treatment and consultation. (He is) referred to ortho OPD for immediate treatment and needful."" A medical officer of the ART centre also gave a similar observation. ""Still I am running from pillar to post. Every time I am asked to come on Tuesday and every time I am told the doctor concerned has not come,"" he alleged. Another patient of Basauri village of Bhojpur district is registered with the PMCH's ART centre since July 1, 2010. He says he had gone to the medicine department of the hospital for endoscopy, but was asked to go home when it was discovered he was HIV+. ""The nurse asked me to go wherever I wished and no one will take any action,"" he wrote to the PMCH superintendent on July 19, 2013. Almost two months on, his wait for endoscopy continues. BSACS' governing council member Gyan Ranjan said ART centres in the hospitals are not apathetic towards such patients. ""However if an HIV+ person goes to any department for treatment, s/he faces harassment. Most of such patients cannot afford private health facilities,"" he said."

Heena (name changed to protect identity), who was suffering from urinary tract infection was taken to SSKM Hospital on September 2. After allegedly waiting for about a week for admission, the 24-year-old was finally taken away by the community members on Tuesday. Last heard, she was on her way to a place in Bihar for 'treatment' by quacks. Heena's fault was that she got castrated in February this year somewhere in Bihar by 'professionals' in the community. Heena was also detected to be HIV-positive about a couple of months back. With no encouragement from the community to go to a hospital, Heena was treated by quacks for a few weeks. But when her condition deteriorated, she sought the help of Association of Trangenders and Hijras in Bengal (ATHB). After running from one official to another at SSKM, Heena was asked to come to the hospital on September 9. She was checked by doctors of the urology department on September 9 and advised admission. But the hospital authority said since Heena had undergone castration, she needed an order from a district judge for admission. ""We had no knowledge of this formality. They kept insisting that we get this order from a district judge. How could the patient get it when she herself was unable to move because of the ailment? We were worried about her condition,"" said ATHB secretary Ranjita Sinha. Heena's cries of pain fell on deaf ears as the hospital allegedly kept citing the legal issues. Aggravating the problem was the absence of a separate ward for the third sex. Even as some doctors were sympathetic, they too pleaded helplessness. The hospital also told them that a relative had to sign a risk bond in case admission was granted. Since Heena has no family, her 'hirja gurus' were convinced by ATHB to sign the bond. Accordingly, some from the community came to the hospital. But seeing the delay and the apathy, they took Heena away and she left for Bihar on Wednesday morning. In the meantime, ATHB members sought the intervention of the West Bengal State AIDs Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS). While some officials claimed that they were talking to hospital authorities; some pleaded that they were out of station. ""Some people from the eunuch community who had come to the hospital were getting impatient. They were pained by the way Heena was suffering. They lamented that they had no place in the society, even in hospitals. Despite our plea to wait for another day, they took Heena away,"" said Sinha. Heena is probably getting 'treatment' right now from quacks somewhere in Bihar. None from SSKM wanted to comment on the allegation. Dr D N Goswami, joint director (TI), who was constantly informed about the problem, also refused to comment saying that he was busy in a meeting. Other WBSAPCS officials, however, said they would look into the issue. ""I had no knowledge about this. This should not have happened. Despite our effort to create awareness and sensitivity, there is still room for improvement. We will take up the issue once we get a complaint on it,"" said Dr Himadri Shekhar Sanyal, additional project director, WBSAPCS."

According to Dr Bhatnagar, these programme will be conducted at district magistrate's level in each district. From members of gram panchayat to higher officials in the districts, health workers and staff will participate in the UPSACS sensitisation programme. The initiative is likely to be flagged off from October month. The official was on a visit in the city for a two-day training programme organised at Centre of Excellence, ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS), Banaras Hindu University (BHU) on Thursday and Friday. The training was held for doctors in view of the new ART centres likely to come up in about one month's time at as many as six districts of the state. Meanwhile, Dr Bhatnagar also visited Shri Shiv Prasad Gupta (SSPG) Divisional Hospital on Thursday evening to look after the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the hospital and took note of the recent case of discrimination towards a HIV positive patient which came to light in July."

The hospital administration has also 'instructed' the blood bank officials to provide blood to such patients without asking for replacement blood. PMCH's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said, ""Operation on HIV+ patients are performed as per the requirement. I have now proposed that such patients be operated every Saturday, so that other operations are not affected. An OT has to be fumigated for 24 hours after operating an HIV patient and it can't be used for that duration. The hospital superintendent will take a final call on this proposal."" To remove doctors' reservation over operating on such patients, safety kits have already been provided to all the departments. If a doctor gets a nick during the operation, certain medicines have also been provided to undo its effect, Dr Karak said. He added, ""The state government's order to give blood to HIV+ patients without replacement blood has been implemented with immediate effect."" It will be the duty of the medical officer concerned to see that the blood supplied by the blood bank is given to the patient before its expiry period of five hours. This will ensure that the blood is not wasted, said Dr Karak. It may be mentioned here that the attendants of a 45-year-old HIV+ woman, who died in PMCH on September 9, had alleged that they could not get blood on time despite being ready to provide replacement blood. The doctors treating the woman had also said that the woman required urgent transfusion of blood. The blood bank's chief medical officer, Dr U P Singh, claimed this instruction was being followed even earlier. Asked why was that woman then denied blood, he said, ""I didn't see the woman's prescription which said that she was HIV positive. Had I known it, replacement blood would not have been demanded."""

108,9,2013,New molecule design prompts HIV to kill itself,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/New-molecule-design-prompts-HIV-to-kill-itself/articleshow/22806220.cms,"WASHINGTON: HIV in suicide mode! In a breakthrough, researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, have created a microbicide that can trick HIV into killing itself without disturbing any healthy cells. Pinning down an effective way to combat the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, the viral precursor to AIDS, has long been a challenge for scientists and physicians, because the virus is an elusive one that mutates frequently and, as a result, quickly becomes immune to medication. A team of Drexel University researchers is trying to get one step ahead of the virus with a microbicide they've created that can trick HIV into ""popping"" itself into oblivion. The microbicide DAVEI - which stands for ""Dual Action Virolytic Entry Inhibitor"" - is the latest in a new generation of HIV treatments that function by specifically destroying the virus without harming healthy cells, researchers said. ""While several molecules that destroy HIV have recently been announced, DAVEI is unique among them by virtue of its design, specificity and high potency,"" said Dr Cameron Abrams, a professor in Drexel's College of Engineering and a primary investigator of the project. A team co-led by Abrams and Dr Irwin Chaiken in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Drexel's College of Medicine, and including R V Kalyana Sundaram, developed the chimeric recombinantly engineered protein - that is, a molecule assembled from pieces of other molecules and engineered for a specific purpose, in this case to fight HIV. HIV invades a healthy cell by first attaching via protein ""spikes"" that then collapse to pull viral and cell membranes together, fusing them and allowing the genetic contents of the virus to enter the healthy cell. The cell is rewired by the viral genetic material into producing more viruses instead of performing its normal function, which, in the case of cells infected by HIV, involves normal immunity. AIDS is the result. ""We hypothesised that an important role of the fusion machinery is to open the viral membrane when triggered, and it follows that a trigger didn't necessarily have to be a doomed cell,"" Abrams said. ""So we envisioned particular ways the components of the viral fusion machinery work and designed a molecule that would trigger it prematurely,"" Abrams said. The team designed DAVEI from two main ingredients. One piece, called the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER), is itself a small piece of the fusion machinery and interacts strongly with viral membranes. The other piece, called cyanovirin, binds to the sugar coating of the protein spike. Working together, the MPER and cyanovirin in DAVEI ""tweak"" the fusion machinery in a way that mimics the forces it feels when attached to a cell. The study was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. "

But, thanks to the exclusive legal aid centre at ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). The centre has so far dealt with 137 cases related to injustice done to patients infected with HIV, who are mostly women. Since its inauguration in April 2010, the legal aid centre has so far handled 153 cases including 78 male and 75 female cases related to various types of discrimination against people infected with HIV. Around 137 cases have been solved outside the court. For instance, a 33-year-old man from Palakkarai in Trichy, who was tested HIV positive after his marriage to a 24-year-old woman in Pudukkottai, died in January 2012. Since her husband succumbed to HIV, the family of her husband harassed her in order to chase her away from them. Moreover, they denied her a share in their property. The woman was brought to the legal aid centre a few months after her husband's death. The advocate and the counsellor counselled the family members of her husband and explained them about the legal consequences they would face if she was denied of her rights. Only then his family agreed to give her share. Initially they disagreed to give her the share as they were under the impression that their son was infected with HIV because of his wife. But the fact was that she was infected with HIV by her husband. ""We are successfully dealing with the case and trying to get justice. The HIV affected people can approach the legal aid centre for solving their problems. The legal aid centre functions on Tuesday and Friday,"" said advocate KAV Dinakaran, who has been dealing with such cases for the past two years. In some cases, the family of the husband is withholding the dowry given to the woman. Likewise, many people don't return the money borrowed from the HIV affected person after the death. Such cases have also been dealt. ""The families of the husband try to seize the property that should be given to his wife. I have come across some patients who were even denied to use the ration card by the family of her husband. The women, who are already upset after being infected by her husband, can not think of approaching the court. The legal aid centre in the ART centre is a boon for such people as it helps them to get their legal issues solved,"" A Thamil, network for positive people in Trichy, told TOI. Besides providing legal aid to HIV affected people, the legal aid centre also distributes to welfare schemes. "

Dr Jaya Chakravarty, Dr Preeti and Dr Archana from Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS), Banaras Hindu University (BHU) inaugurated the centre at Durgakund area of the city. BNPPL HIV AIDS Society is run and managed by HIV positive people themselves and has been helping HIV patients to come to lead a healthy and dignified life for over a decade when there was no ART centre for HIV positive people in Uttar Pradesh. The CSC will extend support to HIV positive people in 15 different districts. According to president, BNPPL, Manoj Singh, the main objective of the centre will be to register all the positive people and give counselling to them. It will also be checked that these people are taking regular medicines through ART centres. At the same time, people who have left the treatment will also be connected by carrying out extensive search and will be put on the treatment once again by giving appropriate counselling to them, he informed. According to Dr Jaya Chakravarty from IMS, around 60% of the HIV patients, who are listed under pre-ART at the ART centre of Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), do not revert back or turn up for the regular check-up. ""The pre-ART person often leave the regular check-up out of social stigma or getting indulged in adverse practices of treatment. Such people are the higher risk factor in the society,"" said Manoj. The volunteers of BNPPL will fight against cases of discrimination that surface against positive people in the region alongside helping HIV positive people to come out of the stigma and depression. ""Social stigma and discrimination prevails in the region. Even I was in a terrible shock when I came to know seven years ago that I was HIV positive,"" said Manoj. A 15-member team comprising doctors, social workers, lawyers and others will also be formed to take up the cause of discrimination against HIV patients. ""We will keep a check in district hospital, divisional hospital as well as at health posts, community health centres (CHCs) and primary health centres (PHCs) for such cases. The patients will also be introduced with various welfare schemes of the government which are meant for them,"" he said. "

The topical anti-fungal drug Ciclopirox causes HIV infected cells to commit suicide by jamming up the cells’ powerhouse — the mitochondria, researchers said. Unlike current anti-HIV drugs, Ciclopirox completely eradicates infectious HIV from cell cultures, with no rebound of virus when the drug is stopped, according to researchers at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. The treatment of patients with HIV has been revolutionized by the advent of combination anti-retroviral drugs. However, although these drugs are highly effective at keeping HIV at bay, they must be taken for the life of the patient and never eliminate the infection completely . This is illustrated by the often rapid resurgence of virus in patients who stop taking these medications. The persistence of HIV is partially due to the ability of the virus to disable the cell's altruistic suicide pathway, which is normally activated when a cell becomes infected or damaged. A team of researchers led by Michael Mathews and Hartmut Hanauske-Abel, previously showed that Ciclopirox, commonly used by dermatologists and gynaecologists to treat fungal infections, inhibits the expression of HIV genes in culture. The drug works inhibits the expression of HIV genes and also blocks the essential function of the mitochondria, thereby reactivating the cell’s suicide pathway. Healthy, uninfected cells examined during this study were spared. And remarkably, the virus did not bounce back when Ciclopirox was removed, researchers said. The utility of Ciclopirox in patients with HIV, for instance after topical application to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, awaits verification in future clinical trials. "

Though the medical professionals at Government General Hospital (GGH) had put up a brave fight through anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to give the baby a new lease of life, her battle with the disease ended leaving her parents shocked. Doctors found that the girl had HIV when she was admitted to a private hospital for treatment of cold and pneumonia few months ago. It was not clear how she contracted the disease as her parents tested negative for the infection. What baffled the doctors more was that the donor, whose blood was picked from a local private blood bank and transfused to the girl, also tested negative. Suspecting that the doctors of the private hospital tampered with the records, the parents lodged a complaint with the local police against the doctors and the blood bank organisers. With private doctors hitting streets against the police case and harassment, district collector Suresh Kumar ordered a thorough probe into the incident. A medical team headed by the head of pediatric wing at GGH, district medical health officer (DMHO) and two other experts conducted an in-depth investigation into the incident by sending the blood samples of the baby and her parents to a private lab in Chennai for PCR test. The issue was further complicated when the PCR test confirmed that the child was positive for HIV and the parents negative. The unfazed private doctors under the aegis of IMA raised suspicion whether the couple was the biological parents of the child. They alleged that the couple might have adopted the girl and demanded further probe. Shocked by the allegations, the parents agreed to undergo DNA test, which too cleared them as biological parents of the ill-fated child. Unable to resolve the mystery, the district administration handed over the entire probe to the AP state AIDS control society (APSACS) in June. Even before the APSACS and the police could crack the mystery, the girl died leaving the parents shell-shocked. The parents Battula Mallikharjuna Rao and Malleswari are daily wagers of Dachepalli area and are settled in Guntur. "
115,9,2013,New intra-vaginal ring may prevent HIV in women,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/New-intra-vaginal-ring-may-prevent-HIV-in-women/articleshow/23255807.cms,"WASHINGTON: A new easy-to-use intra-vaginal ring filled with an anti-retroviral drug could be extremely effective at preventing the deadly HIV in women, a new study has found. The ring is easy to use, long-lasting, and recently has demonstrated a 100 per cent success rate protecting primates from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). The device will soon undergo its first test in humans, researchers said. ""After 10 years of work, we have created an intra-vaginal ring that can prevent against multiple HIV exposures over an extended period of time, with consistent prevention levels throughout the menstrual cycle,"" said Patrick Kiser, an expert in intra-vaginal drug delivery. Previous studies have demonstrated that antiviral drugs can prevent HIV infection, but existing methods for delivering the drug fall short. Pills must be taken daily and require high doses; vaginal gels that must be applied prior to each sex act are inconvenient, yielding poor usage rates. The new ring is easily inserted and stays in place for 30 days. Moreover, because it is delivered at the site of transmission, the ring — known as a TDF-IVR (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate intravaginal ring) — utilizes a smaller dose than pills. The device contains powdered tenofovir, an anti-retroviral drug that is taken orally by 3.5 million HIV-infected people worldwide, but that has not previously been studied topically, researchers said. The ring's strength stems from its unique polymer construction: its elastomer swells in the presence of fluid, delivering up to 1,000 times more of the drug than current intra-vaginal ring technology, such as NuvaRing, which are made of silicon and have release rates that decline over time. The upcoming clinical trial, to be conducted in November at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, will evaluate the ring in 60 women over 14 days. The trial will assess the ring's safety and measure how much of the drug is released and the properties of the ring after use. Other drugs could potentially be integrated into the ring, such as contraceptives or antiviral drugs to prevent other sexually transmitted infections — a feature that could increase user rates, said Kiser, who joined Northwestern University from the University of Utah, where the research was conducted. The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). "

MSRTC said that the complainant would not be paid back wages for the period when he was unemployed. A division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Revati Mohite Dere heard a petition by the driver, who was sacked after he was declared by Pune's Sassoon Hospital as being unfit to drive heavy vehicles. The HC had asked MSRTC to withdraw its termination letter and give him ""light work"" as a peon. On September 13, the MSRTC told court that it would reappoint him subject to medical fitness. After a copy of the fitness certificate by Sassoon Hospital declaring the driver fit to work as a peon was submitted, MSRTC's advocate G S Hegde said he will be reinstated provided he does not claim back wages, according to a settlement reached between the two parties.

117,10,2013,12 Madurai prisoners test HIV positive,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/12-Madurai-prisoners-test-HIV-positive/articleshow/23552482.cms,"MADURAI: In a shocking revelation, 12 inmates of the Madurai Central prison are found to have tested positive for HIV in the past few months. But, these inmates are left in the lurch due to lack of treatment. There are about 1,700 inmates in the central prison. In the last six months alone, 12 new HIV positive inmates have been identified. Sources from the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) allege that lack of cooperation and interest among the higher officials of the society and central prison has been hindering treatment for the inmates. Treatment for the newly-detected cases in the last six months could not be started due to this. ""As many as six inmates were found with HIV infection in April this year alone after undergoing the mandatory tests for new inmates of the prison. In May, no case was detected. However, six cases were detected between June and September. Since homosexual activity is rampant in the prison the inmates have high risk of getting infection. Detecting the HIV patients and providing required treatment for them is indispensable,"" said sources from the TANSACS. Doctors say that testing the HIV patients at regular intervals is absolutely necessary. They should be brought to the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) on the premises of the Government Rajaji Hospital for treatment. They would be provided with medicines and kept in observation to analyse the patients' reaction to the medicine. Sources from TANSACS said that they could not provide treatment for the HIV inmates since they are not brought to ART centres by the prison authorities. Citing inadequate police strength to escort the inmates to the centre, the officers refuse to send them for treatment. As a consequence, the inmates are deprived of proper treatment ending up in getting only regular tablets, they said. Moreover, TANSACS officials could not follow the HIV positive inmates when they are released on bail since majority of the prisoners' address available with the prison are found to be fake, the sources added. When contacted, M Kalirajan, district programme manager for prevention and control of HIV-AIDS, Madurai said, ""We are aware of the situation. We have taken up the issue to the notice of our project director a month ago. Action is yet to be taken. We have also suggested an alternative idea of sending ART specialists inside the prison to treat the patients."" K Anandan, superintendent of police, Madurai Central Prison when contacted said that they rely only on the city police to escort the HIV positive inmates to GRH. At times when the city police's strength is fully utilised for heavy security the inmates cannot be taken to the hospital. In such cases they would send paramedical staff to collect tables from the hospital, he said."

""Be a volunteer in spreading awareness HIV and AIDS… If you become a part of the crusade, half the battle could be won,"" Fernandes said while addressing a rally on HIV/AIDS under the multimedia campaign here on Thursday evening. Fernandes, who is also the president of Forum for Parliamentarians on HIV/AIDS, called upon people to put an end to the social stigmas associated with the disease and urged them to help those affected lead normal lives. ""We should work hand-in-hand to stop the rapid spread of the disease and in this way prevalence of the disease in the state could also be brought down by fifty per cent. Involving youths in the campaign will help the state government to win the battle against the menace,"" he added. Stating that India provides AIDS medicine to 80 per cent countries in the world because of its cheap prices, the Union minister said people across the world are looking at India as a leader in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Arunachal Pradesh has recorded 216 HIV seropositive cases out of total 2, 24, 918 patients screened and the first AIDS case in the state was detected in 1998. Out of 18 districts three are not affected by HIV/AIDS at all, while the state government has established 27 integrated counseling and treatment centers (ICTCs) in the state with 20 Red Ribbon Clubs."

The rate of positivity oscillated between 10-13% from 1996 to 2001 but came down to 1.7% in 2012. The decrease in HIV cases has been significant since 2008, in which year the rate of positivity dropped to 6.10% and in the subsequent year it dropped to 4.25%. As per the last count, in April 2013, 168 new cases were detected as against 1,000-900 new cases registered every year about a decade ago. Dr Sachin Govenkar, project director, Goa State Aids Control society (GSACs), said better surveillance, awareness programmes and interventions, have helped curb HIV in the state. The drop in number of HIV cases is significant because the number of blood samples tested during the last five years is far higher than between 2003 and 2008. Since 2009 onwards, the number of blood samples tested crossed the 30,000-mark, whereas during the preceding years' blood samples tested varied between 14,000 and 25,000 a year. In 2012 itself, 44,553 blood samples were tested and 532 new cases were detected during that period. ""Intensified awareness programmes carried out by the GSACs for over a decade in co-ordination with NGOs have proved effective in curtailing the number of cases,"" a GSACs official said. There have been no other changes observed in the detection pattern of HIV infections. Four major coastal talukas -- Tiswadi, Bardez, Salcete and Mormugao continue to have a high rate of HIV prevalence. Also, 80-85% of the total HIV cases belong in the age group of 15-49 years, and sexual transmission is the predominant mode of contraction. Antiretroviral therapy started in Goa Medical College (GMC) &amp; Hospital, Bambolim, in 2005 has been a great solace to HIV/AIDS patients. AIDS patients with CD 4 count less than 200 are provided free antiretroviral treatment."

The 7-year-old boy from Barasat was only a toddler when he lost his father to HIV/AIDS. His mother, also HIV-positive, begs for a living. HIV-affected Rahul was over the moon on Tuesday when he got new clothes for this year, thanks to nursing students and staff of the College of Nursing, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. ""Ami packet ta khule dekhbo ki dress acchhe? (May I open the packet to see what dress is in it?)"", asked Ria Mistry. The five-year-old lost her father to AIDS before she was born. Her mother succumbed to the disease two months ago. Since then, she has been living with her ailing grandparents in Basirhat. The students and staff of the nursing college distributed clothes to around 60 HIV-positive children. Most of these kids got the disease from their parents. A few of the thalassaemic children got infected during blood transfusion. ""Durga Puja is the time when people especially children love to flaunt their new clothes. Most of these children are orphans. Our students and staff have collected money to bring a smile on their faces. Such an interaction also helps us change the attitude of people towards HIV-positive patients,"" said S Das, a senior lecturer at the college. This is the second successive year the college has gifted clothes and other gifts to HIV-positive children under the 'Joy of Giving' campaign. For the students it was not just the joy of giving but an opportunity to interact with HIV patients. ""Even in the medical fraternity, awareness on HIV/AIDS is very low. An interaction with these patients helps remove the mental block. Spending time with them is an opportunity to learn and understand them better,"" said Apabrita Bandyopadhyay, a fourth-year nursing student. The college has tied up with North 24-Parganas Network for People living with HIV/AIDS (NNP+). West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society project director Utpal Bhattacharya, who was present at the function, lauded the students and teachers of the college for their gesture that touched the hearts of several kids. The principal of the medical college, Suddhadhan Batabyal, and the nursing college principal handed over the gifts to the kids. ""The gesture by the students and staff of the nursing college has touched us. These children are needy and they have none to shower them gifts. Giving them new clothes to wear during the festival means a lot to them,"" said Shukla Chakraborty, vice-president of NNP+. (Names of HIV-positive children have been changed)"

Their efforts to control the spread of deadly disease by launching various awareness programmes seem to have paid off in Dharwad district. The number of HIV cases has come down drastically in Dharwad in the past five years. From April 2008 to March 2009, 2,345 people were found to be HIV positive of 13,387 subjected to blood test to check HIV prevalence. The figure was alarming which put the health department in a tight spot and compelled it to take measures to control the spread of the disease in the district, which is known as the educational and cultural hub of North Karnataka, sources said. Blood samples of 18,860 people tested from April 1 to August, 31, 2013, it was found that only 567 people were infected with deadly disease in district, which brought much-needed relief to the health department particularly the Aids Prevention Society run by the government in district, Dr SM Honakeri, officer for district Aids prevention programme, told TOI. ""We are really happy that the number of HIV positive cases dropped in the district when compared to last year. Now, the HIV positive rate is 3.55% against the 4.25 to 5% last year. We will check the results every month and take steps to prevent further spread of the disease,"" he added. The number of HIV cases among pregnant women has also come down. ""When we tested the blood samples of 15,717 pregnant women, we found only 21 HIV positive cases this year. Overall, HIV positive percentage has come down to 3.55 from 17.5 in the past five years,"" he said. The Aids Prevention Society conducted various programmes to educate people. ""All programmes we implemented have brought positive results. Our efforts to meet the people at their door-steps under Mane-Mane Beti (house to house visit) programme to educate people about Aids yielded the desired results,"" he said. They are spreading the message through performing arts too. ""A troupe of artistes under Kala Jata troupes holds street plays and other awareness programmes during fairs,"" he said."

Due to this, the follow-up and treatment for the newly-detected HIV patients is also at stake. Officials of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) fume over the unnecessary delay in announcing the HIV test results, which make them to run from pillar to post in search of the patients who test positive. They say that every month around 10 to 15 HIV positive patients tested at the VCTC could not be traced from a total of around 45 positive cases. Although the time needed for the preliminary test is only a couple of minutes, it takes one day's time to announce the results due to the absence of a CMO, who is the authority to approve the test result. Sources from Tansacs say that an estimated 120 HIV positive cases go untraced every year due to this delay. They do not return the next day to receive the results mainly due to fear. If the results are furnished instantly they can be counselled and treated, they add since the anti-retroviral therapy centre to treat the patients is available inside the same building. ""While there are already 4,550 HIV positive patients in Madurai district under treatment, the Tansacs officials are concerned about the growing number of untraced HIV patients in the district. The untraced HIV patients pose threat of spreading the disease swiftly,"" say sources. At present, one of the professors from the department of microbiology is in-charge of the VCTC. However, she cannot stay at the centre since she has to engage in classes at the medical college. Sources from Tansacs, however, urged to depute an assistant or postgraduate medical student for the test confirmation. When contacted, M Kalirajan, district programme manager for Prevention and Control of HIV-AIDS, Madurai said, ""We are aware of the problem and have taken the issue to our higher officials and waiting for action. The problem is there in the centre for the last two years. We have also urged the hospital authorities to bring an end to the problem,"" he said.

The proposal issued by the state council instructs public bathhouses to display signs prohibiting “people with sexually transmitted diseases, Aids and infectious skin diseases”. The move has caused an uproar in local dailies and users of Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, are shocked at the medical ignorance displayed by the government. “There is no evidence that people can be infected with HIV in public bathhouses,” Wu Hao, from the Beijing Research Centre on Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Aids, was quoted as saying by the Beijing Morning News. “Apparently, the rule to bar HIV patients from entering public bathhouses is way over the top,” he said. The high level of disapproval also emerged in interviews of other activists conducted by the paper. “Banning HIV patients from using public bathhouses and spas will only exacerbate people’s misunderstanding, discrimination and fear of HIV/Aids and will not help reduce the transmission of the disease,” it quoted an unnamed activist as saying. The United Nations’ Aids agency has also expressed worry over the move. “UNAIDS recommends that restrictions preventing people living with HIV from accessing bathhouses, spas and other similar facilities be removed from the final draft of this policy,” Hedia Belhadj, the China coordinator of the agency was quoted by AFP as saying. According to government figures released in 2012, China has 430,000 people infected with HIV."

District health officials have been asked to check the status of migrants living in these villages as they are among the prime carriers of HIV in the district and organize composite health camps. District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) officials claim that Allahabad is among 28 districts in the state identified for composite health camps by the NACO and has the largest number of migrant labourers. The composite health check up camps would be held in these villages between Tuesday and November 14. The composite health check up would have five specific components, including normal check up and medication; HIV/Aids and sexually transmitted diseases consultation and related counseling/testing and treatment; anti-natal check up of all pregnant women; promotion of condoms-cum-exhibition; and, folk group programmes for awareness. Terming migrants as the most susceptible to and responsible for the spread of the fatal disease, nodal officer of DAPCU Dr OP Shahi said “under the directives of NACO and UPACS, efforts are afoot to identify such patients for medication and counselling.” He further said that villages prone to high risk have been placed under the scanner and a series of awareness and educational camps were being undertaken to check the menace. DAPCU has already prepared a list of migrants in these villages and ASHA workers and ANMs have been asked to encourage such migrants to attend the camp,” he added. The first composite health camp would be held at Meja on Tuesday. It would be followed by camps in Phulpur, Soraon, Karchana and Handia on October 23, November 12, November 13 and November 14 respectively. Dr Shahi said “the department will undertake an intensive drive to apprise migrant labourers of the health camp where they would be offered counselling, testing and treatment facilities.” He further said that a study on migration pattern and prevalence of HIV was already underway and added “officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and men having sex with men (MSM) so that concrete measures could be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus.” The three categories of migrants responsible for the spread of disease are workers at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who migrate from one state to another for livelihood)."
125,10,2013,Coming soon: Life insurance policy for HIV/AIDS patients,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Coming-soon-Life-insurance-policy-for-HIV/AIDS-patients/articleshow/24558788.cms,"CHENNAI: Life insurance for people with AIDS and HIV may soon become a reality. The insurance regulator has issued draft guidelines seeking views and comments from insurers on issuing life cover policies to persons with HIV/AIDS. The draft circular by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on policies for people with HIV/AIDS, issued this month, may come into effect from April 2014. Insurers are expected to put in place a board-approved underwriting manual, claims manual, proposal form and other necessary systems before this date. A vast majority of those afflicted in India are in the age bracket of 15 to 49 years. As per estimates, about 2.4 million Indians are living with HIV/AIDS. Children less than 15 years account for 3.5% of it while 83% are in the age group of 15-49 years. Health cover for people suffering from HIV/AIDS already exists. With advances in medical treatment, insurers are able to put in place cost structures. Some standalone health insurance providers like Star Health &amp; Allied Insurance offer such insurance. ""We offer group covers to NGOs for their members. Our policy prescribes the entry parameters,"" V Jagannathan, chairman, Star Health said. Insurers say claims management and profitability will be key concerns when life insurance is offered to those with AIDS. There would be additional costs. ""In terms of product pricing, insurers mostly rely on past claims experience. Since this would be a new product altogether, the pricing could be at both ends of the spectrum. Insurers may start at the lower range, get claims and then revise premiums upwards. They may also err on the side of caution with higher rates in the beginning and as more players come into the market, the rates would become more competitive,"" Rahul Aggarwal, CEO of Optima Insurance Brokers, said. ""The premium loadings would also depend on the age of the person and stage of the condition,"" Vikas Gujral, executive vice-president and head, customer service and operations, Max Life Insurance said. Some companies are looking at dual cover—health in addition to life—to ensure better claim control. ""We may insist on a health cover before issuing a life cover for this segment because in case of AIDS/HIV, the patient has lower immunity than the rest of the population. So, he/she is susceptible to other illnesses as well,"" a life insurer said. Industry observers say that due to the nature of the condition, insurers would also have to contend with a huge claims outgo. ""Chances are high that the insured may use up the sum insured every year and once a policy is issued, it cannot be withdrawn,"" Aggarwal said. Insurers are also playing it safe. Companies like Max and HDFC have already started talks with global reinsurers to participate in this scheme. ""This is a fairly complex product and we are taking inputs from reinsurers as they have global exposure on this front,"" Sanjay Tiwari, vice-president, products, HDFC Life said. ""We would have to keep tabs on patient check-ups, keep abreast of the latest medicines as all of that would go into our claims experience data,"" Gujral said."

Insurers feel designing such a policy would involve intricate issues of premium, patient confidentiality and sustainability. A 21-year-old Ghatkopar youth, who has been on HIV treatment since eight years, welcomed the move. “With antiretroviral treatment, lifespan has increased. Those infected not only want to lead normal lives and have families but also secure their future,” he said. The draft circular, issued this month, by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority on policies for people with HIV/ AIDS may come into effect from April 2014. The draft guidelines pondered over issues like cover for those who acquire HIV after the policy’s commencement. About 1.48 lakh people died of AIDS-related causes in India last year. Deaths among HIV-infected children account for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. However, the insurers are worried about a majority of deaths in the younger age-groups. “HIV-related mortality has come down but still affects the young age group,” said Dr Alaka Deshpande, former head of JJ Hospital’s ART centre."

Her husband died on the way to the hospital. The 35-year-old woman from Huruha village in Dharmanagar has developed a multiple-organ disorder. The couple had consumed pesticide on October 24 to get rid of social humiliation. The couple was diagnosed with HIV around three years ago during a blood test when the woman was five-month pregnant. Following doctors' advice, the woman had terminated her pregnancy immediately. The couple was allegedly ostracized by their family members, relatives and neighbours over the last three years. ""I was infected from my husband after we got married in 2008, but I had accepted it as my fate and decided to live together. We didn't have any problem in our marital life, except family members, relatives disgracing us every now and then,"" she told the media in the hospital. The humiliation crossed all limits when their relatives started abusing them in public. The situation turned worse on October 23 when her in-laws decided to throw them out of the village apprehending further spread of the disease if they continued to stay in the locality. ""We decided to take the extreme step and die together to save ourselves from further social and family isolation. Ever since the diagnosis, there have been a lot of medical complications, but our mental agony was far worse. Instead of any moral support, our families rejected us. It was very difficult for us to carry on,"" she said. Her husband had admitted that he was the carrier, she said. With the intervention of the Tripura AIDS Control Society, the couple had joined a network of HIV positive people in the state. Despite humiliation from family members and neighbours, the couple lived a normal life following counseling sessions and assistance from the society. In fact, the man was very popular among a group of 1,600 HIV- positive people. The members had even decided that he would be made the next secretary of the group, an official of the society said. ""We have asked police to take steps against the family members because what they have done is a serious crime. Our counsellors held a number of sessions with the family members and tried to convince them that the couple needed their support, instead of isolation,"" a senior official of the society said. SP (North) Abhijit Saptarshi said, ""We have recorded the testimony of the woman. She is recovering now."""

Around 30 HIV infected children along with their parents and a group of transgender people from the district celebrated their Diwali together at a function organized in the city on Thursday. Aged between six and 15 years, these under privileged children enjoyed the day by taking part in the celebrations, which was jointly organized by Madurai District Legal Services Authority and a handful of NGOs in the city. They had worn masks to prevent their identity from being exposed in the public domain, inside the district court premises with fun and fireworks. The children, who had worn masks to prevent their identity from being exposed in the public domain, had a power-packed day along with a group of five transgender people, who usually do not celebrate the festival. Excited about the new dresses which they had received from the philanthropists, the HIV infected children burst out into laughter along with their new friends who had come from various places. While most of the children choose to stick to the colourful fireworks which were handed over to them, a few brave lads even experimented high-decibel crackers too. Holding a 100-wala cracker pack in his hands, a 15-year-old boy looked as if he was full-filling his long-term dream.

130,11,2013,Scientists unlock clues to HIV vaccine,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Scientists-unlock-clues-to-HIV-vaccine/articleshow/25060861.cms," WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists have mapped the most detailed images yet of the protein responsible for getting HIV into cells, paving way for a potential vaccine for AIDS. The new findings of the AIDS-causing virus's complex envelope, includes sites that future vaccines will try to mimic to elicit a protective immune response. Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and Weill Cornell Medical College determined the first atomic-level structure of the tripartite HIV envelope protein?long considered one of the most difficult targets in structural biology and of great value for medical science. ""Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits; but we've needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine,"" said Ian A Wilson, a senior author of the study. HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, currently infects about 34 million people globally, 10 per cent of whom are children, according to World Health Organisation estimates. Although antiviral drugs are now used to manage many HIV infections, especially in developed countries, scientists have long sought a vaccine that can prevent new infections and perhaps ultimately eradicate the virus from the human population. However, none of the HIV vaccines tested so far has come close to providing adequate protection. This failure is due largely to the challenges posed by HIV's envelope protein, known to virologists as Env. Env's structure is so complex and delicate that scientists have had great difficulty obtaining the protein in a form that is suitable for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to understand it. ""It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it?s on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable,"" said biologist Andrew Ward. The research team was able to engineer a version of the Env trimer (three-component structure) that has the stability and other properties needed for atomic-resolution imaging, yet retains virtually all the structures found on native Env. Using cutting-edge imaging methods, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, the team was able to look at the new Env trimer. The X-ray crystallography study was the first ever of an Env trimer, and both methods resolved the trimer structure to a finer level of detail than has been reported before. The data illuminated the complex process by which the Env trimer assembles and later undergoes radical shape changes during infection and clarified how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses, such as flu and Ebola. The findings are published in the journal Science Express. "

The woman and her husband were diagnosed with HIV three years ago. The couple had consumed poison on the night of October 24. The man died on the same night. A doctor said she was recovering well and responding to the treatment. However, on Thursday night, she developed a problem in her kidneys that resulted in serious respiratory complications, leading to her death. The woman's family members performed her last rites on Saturday after a postmortem was conducted. The couple was diagnosed with HIV during a blood test when the woman was five-months pregnant. Following doctors' advice, the woman had terminated her pregnancy immediately. The couple was allegedly ostracized by their family members, relatives and neighbours over the last three years. They took the extreme step on October 24 after their family members decided to throw them away from village. The family members apprehended further spread of the disease if they continued to stay in the locality. SP (North) Abhijit Saptarshi said police have recorded the statement of the victim when she was alive and an investigation is on. ""We are looking at all possible angles in the case,"" Saptarshi said. ""I was infected from my husband after we got married in 2008 but I accepted it as my fate and decided to live together till death. We didn't have any problem in our marital life except social and family humiliations from both of our families,"" she had told media persons a few days ago in the hospital."

During the event, the district child protection unit (DCPU) decided to send a proposal to the district administration to take steps for the empowerment of the HIV-affected children. The event, 'Children Se Dosti,' was jointly organised by Childline 1098 and DCPU in collaboration with Operation Rainbow, a centre that cares and supports the children affect ted by HIV/AIDS. Advising the people to be friendly with such children, the district child protection officer (DPCO) R Devika, who spoke on the occasion, said, ""Such children are punished for no mistake of theirs. Instead of isolating them, people should behave in a friendly manner."" During the event, children tied friendship bands on the each others' wrists and the organisers to establish friendship. What added colour to the event was the decision of DPCO to send a proposal to the district collector to provide assistance to empower them. ""When I talked to some of the children here, I realised that most of them do not have parents or have a single parent, who are also infected with HIV. This provoked us to help them to come up in society. We have got a list of 17 children from the Operation Rainbow. Likewise, we will also try to collect lists of such children from other NGOs. Then we will send it to the district administration seeking their assistance,"" the DPCO told TOI. She also warned the unregistered children homes in the district to register as per Juvenile Justice Act, 2000. ""Many of the homes in the district have not been registered as per the Act, though we had sent them reminders. Sever action would be take action against such homes,"" the DPCO warned. The children were also taught how to distinguish the safe and unsafe touches by people in the family and outside. A Albert Manoharan, co-ordinator, Childline Socsead said, ""The parents should not allow others to touch your children to avoid the sexual abuses."" Advocate S Martin, childline advisory board, Trichy asked the students to make use of the toll free number '1098' to report any problems relating to children.

BSACS project director Sanjeev Sinha said the society is not getting the requisite amount of drugs from Naco and national programme officer (ART) in Naco, New Delhi, Dr B B Rewari, said the requisite drugs have already been sent to all states. He said, while talking to TOI over the phone, ""This was a problem some time ago. But all required drugs have been dispatched to all the states last week itself. It is now for the respective state bodies to ensure proper distribution of drugs."" Patients at 13 ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres in the state say either they have been returned empty-handed from the centres or made to do rounds of these centres. Subhash Prasad (48) of Lakhisarai, who is registered with Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) ART centre, was told there was no medicine when he went there last time. When he went there for the second time on Wednesday, he was given medicines just for two days. ""Doctors say medicines should not be discontinued. But it is not economically viable for me to come to PMCH every fifth day,"" he rued. Similarly, 50-year-old Mohammad Rameez of Katihar said he got medicines only for two days this week. Kamla Devi, who hails from a village under Bhagwanganj police station, was in tears narrating her tale. ""My 13-year-old son returned empty-handed last time when we visited the PMCH centre. On Wednesday too, I reached there in the morning but they asked me to wait. I am a widow and have no source of income,"" she said. Ironically, the social stigma attached with the disease has not yet wiped off despite a number of awareness campaign carried out by governments and social organizations. Patients are harassed by Doyen, the private pathology service provider at PMCH. ""They straightaway refused to take my blood sample. When I insisted, they asked me to buy a special pair of gloves for the person who will collect my blood sample,"" said Manu Sah, a telecom firm employee at Patna. The story of those registered with Rajendra Memorial Research Institute is no different. Meena Rani (ART no 6027), who went there on Friday, said, ""I was not given any medicine because it wasn't there."" Doctors say first and second line of treatment at private shops costs Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 per month respectively. President of Bihar Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS Society, Gyan Ranjan, said over 100 patients from Mothihari, Muzaffarpur and Chhapra ART centres returned without drugs from the respective centres this week. ""I have written numerous mails to BSACS, but to no avail."" BSACS governing council member and physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said ART drug suppresses HIV virus and restores immunity system of the body which is destroyed by the virus. If there is a gap in medication, the virus becomes resistant and the treatment fails. He further said, ""If first line of medication fails, second line of treatment is prescribed. If that too fails, then it is a death sentence because third line of treatment is not available. The immune system of the body stops functioning."" (Names of all patients have been changed)"

With the shortage of delivery kits, which doctors wear while assisting in the delivery of HIV positive women, doctors and officials of Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) were in a fix. Thanks to the two stories published in The Times of India recently, pertaining to the shortage of delivery kits, a consignment of 420 kits, which officials estimate would see them through the next year, reached Madurai a week ago. A regular doctor has been posted in Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART), inside the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) premises, to announce HIV test results immediately, reacting to another story published in the paper in October. Sources from TANSACS said that they have received a consignment of 420 kits. ""During each delivery case of an HIV infected pregnant woman, five kits are needed for a team of doctors. On an average, 80 such cases are handled in Madurai district, majority of them in GRH. With the absence of kits for more than six months, TANSACS officials in Madurai had been managing by borrowing kits from other districts. There was an unnecessary delay in announcing the HIV test results conducted for suspected patients in GRH. The delay was due to the absence of dedicated doctors in the ART centre. Due to the delay, many HIV positive patients who were indifferent to the results could not be traced. Taking note of the news article published in TOI, a doctor has been assigned to the centre with mandatory attendance registry. When contacted, M Kalirajan, District Programme Manager for Prevention and Control of HIV-AIDS, confirmed that they have received the consignment of kits."

Ahead of World AIDS Day that falls on December 1, students of Panjab University's University Institute of Chemical Engineering and Technology (UICET) have undertaken an initiative to help the neglected sections of society - beginning with a group of HIV positive women. The project, initiated by students of ENACTUS club at UICET, involves supporting a group of 10 women, who are HIV positive. Under the project, 13 members of the club have taken ahead National Aids Control Organization (NACO)-funded group to promote and sell their final products. The self-help unit, which had received a bank loan of Rs 10 lakh through NACO, was unable to find any buyers for the bags they were making, after an initial phase of sales. ""Although the loan helped the women import sewing and printing machines from Germany and produce semi-cloth bags of high quality, they had not been able to bag any orders for over four months. Even as the bags are competitive enough to hold a stand in the market, the women hardly have any market knowledge. This worked to their disadvantage and they couldn't generate any sales,"" said UICET student Aman Arora. He believed that the bio-degradability of the bags will add to their USP, given that plastic bags have been banned in the market. ""These bags decompose in six months and are quite affordable, costing between Rs 160 and Rs 300 per kilogram,"" Arora added. After the students stepped in, the scenario of the unit has changed for the better. On the verge of being shut down in the absence of any orders, the UICET students helped the unit increase its market, outreach as well as profits. The team members went to shops in malls and other markets of Chandigarh for negotiating orders for the bags. ""There was some problem with the screen they used for printing the bags. After it was changed and samples were shown to stores, the response was good. We helped them get orders from shops in leading malls and different markets of the city,"" said UICET's Enactus president Saurabh Mittal. The group organized drives in sectors 8, 9 17, 22 and Mohali's Phase 7 and helped the unit get orders of nearly 250 kg, of which 200kg have already been delivered. Students of the club - Vinay Jain, Navleen Kaur and Tarun Sanduja - also helped create newer designs for prints. Enactus members also intend to include four more HIV positive women and hire a permanent sales executive for the self-help group. The group is guided by their faculty advisor - UICET associate professor Seema Kapoor. "

140,11,2013,Treatment of HIV-AIDS still poses socio-psychological issues: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Treatment-of-HIV-AIDS-still-poses-socio-psychological-issues-Study/articleshow/26598621.cms," VISAKHAPATNAM: The treatment of the dreaded HIV-AIDS may have seen considerable advancements in the last decade thanks to relentless medical research worldwide, but the social stigma and ethical issues revolving around the treatment of HIV-AIDS poses socio-psychological questions, as a recent study by an eminent city-based doctor indicates. The unique two-year study on 1,800 HIV positive cases in the city found that in almost 75 % of the cases, the patients are not given the right to know about their treatment procedure, informed consent is not taken from 55.1% patients and in nearly 50% cases, principles of confidentiality are not properly maintained, apart from findings related to patient-doctor experiences in treatment of HIV or AIDS. Claimed to be the first of its kind study internationally, the analytical study titled 'Ethical Challenges Involved in the Care of HIV/AIDS Patients and Protecting the rights of the Community,' was undertaken by Padmashree awardee Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who specialises in the treatment of HIV-AIDS. Though the study was done in the city, the findings more or less hold good for Indian patients in all cities, Dr Surya Rao said. The study was necessitated as several ethical issues and challenges started emerging, especially in terms of the standard of care of HIV/AIDS patients, due to the increasing commercialisation of the medical profession, the doctor stated. The study sought the opinion of the patients on parameters and ethical issues such as principles of autonomy, paternalism or dictatorship, dignity of individual, informed consent, right to refuse treatment, principles of confidentiality, patient's right to know about his treatment and also role of surrogates (family or relatives). Of the 1,800 HIV positive patients, 1,450 fully participated in the study between March 2011 and February 2013 and are under treatment at KKSR Hospital and Research Centre, Visakhapatnam. After getting complete responses from 1,450 patients, the study found that 65.6% of the patients faced paternalism or authoritarian behaviour from doctors, 55.2% felt they were not treated in a dignified manner, 75.8% patients faced lack of autonomy, informed consent (that is explaining the pros and cons of treatment and contraindications to patients) was not taken from 55.1% patients, 87.2% patients had no choice to refuse treatment, principle of confidentiality about treatment and HIV status was maintained only in 48.2% cases. Further, just 24.1% of patients said they were informed about their treatment procedures and in 86.2% cases, it's the patients' relatives or guardians who spoke to the doctor on behalf of the patients without giving the patients a chance to speak up about their problems. ""Overall, it was felt that the United Nations Organisation and World Health Organisation should formulate and implement new ethical guidelines in the treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients in the background of severe stigma attached to HIV/AIDS,"" stated Dr Rao. Referring to the key points of the study, professor of psychiatry and superintendent of Government Hospital for Mental Health, Vizag, Dr N N Raju, pointed out that HIV-AIDS is one ailment that is associated with a lot of stigma and different socio-psychological aspects are involved, especially in India. ""Many a time, we come across family members who request the treating doctors not to reveal the HIV status to the patient as they fear the patient would get depressed or turn suicidal if they learn the truth. In such cases, getting informed consent becomes difficult."" ""Moreover, in India, the doctor-patient ratio is disproportionate and one doctor sometimes has to see around 100 patients a day, which makes giving a patient hearing to each case difficult. More social workers and trained counsellors are required to generate awareness. With effective treatment regime available, HIV, like TB, can be controlled to a great extent and so the stigma needs to be dispelled gradually as has happened in the case of TB in last few decades,"" stated the doctor."
141,11,2013,World’s most aggressive strain of HIV discovered,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Worlds-most-aggressive-strain-of-HIV-discovered/articleshow/26601284.cms,"LONDON: Scientists have discovered the world’s most aggressive HIV strain. Swedish researchers have reported that a recently discovered HIV strain leads to significantly faster development of AIDS than currently prevalent forms. There are over 60 different epidemic strains of HIV and geographic regions are often dominated by one or two of these. It has been confirmed earlier that if a person becomes infected with two different strains, they can fuse and a recombined form can occur. The new strain found to be the most dangerous has been found in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa. The period from infection to development of AIDS was the shortest reported among HIV-1 types, at around five years. “Recombinants seem to be more vigorous and more aggressive than the strains from which they developed. The recombinant studied is called A3/02 and is a cross between the two most common strains in Guinea-Bissau, 02AG and A3,” said Angelica Palm from Lund University. So far the new strain has only been identified in West Africa, but other studies have shown that the global spread of different recombinants is increasing. “In countries and regions with high levels of immigration, such as the US and Europe, the trend is towards an increasingly mixed and complex HIV flora, unlike in the beginning of the epidemic when a small number of non-recombinant variants of the virus dominated. There is, therefore, reason to be wary of HIV recombinants in general,” Palm added. The virus strain was first reported by Joakim Esbjornsson from the University of Oxford, who is the co-author of the study. An estimated 4.9 million people were living with HIV in Asia-Pacific in 2012. Twelve countries account for more than 90% of people living with HIV and of new HIV infections in the region which includes India, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Emerging epidemics are becoming evident: between 2001 and 2012, new HIV infections increased 2.6 times in Indonesia, Pakistan has seen an eight-fold increase and new infections in the Philippines have more than doubled. “HIV is an extremely dynamic and variable virus. New subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been introduced to our part of the world, and it is highly likely that there are a large number of circulating recombinants of which we know little or nothing. We, therefore, need to be aware of how the HIV-1 epidemic changes over time,” said Patrik Medstrand, professor of clinical virology at Lund University. "

All of them had one thing in common; they had all battled a dreaded virus, scathing comments and isolation to tell their story. Ahead of World AIDS day on December 1, HIV infected people from different parts of the city congregated at Government General Hospital on Friday to narrate their ordeal and their fight with a disease which was once considered a killer. The people stood in stark contrast to the images usually portrayed of the HIV infected. “I am perfectly normal. I don’t see myself as a patient any more,” said 60-year-old Murugesh*, a caterer, who was diagnosed as HIV positive two decades ago. Like every other HIV infected person, the father of two thought he was as good as dead when he tested positive. “When I saw my wife and children, I re-discovered my will to live. I decided to fight against it till my last breath, and here I am two decades later,” smiled Murugesh. While Murugesh found his strength in his family, Hema* knew it would be the end of the road for her only son if she succumbed to the virus. “My son was just four when my husband and I were infected. We had married against our families’ wishes. We knew he would have no one if we died,” said the 42-year-old, who was infected in 2001. “My husband died in 2004. My resolve to live only grew stronger after that. I did odd jobs to fund my son’s education. Many people turned me away when they got to know I had AIDS,” said Hema, who had a near death experience in 2006. The gathered people rued that despite awareness campaigns by the government, HIV infected and affected people have a tough time getting a job. “It is sad that they are still identified as patients who have a dreaded disease. While many are waking up to the fact that HIV can’t be transmitted through sharing a glass, the awareness hasn’t gone to the extent of employing infected people. While anti-retroviral drugs has helped manage the disease, we still need to come up with a tool to help them fight stigma,” said S Noori, president of South India Positive Network. Doctors at the hospital said the antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the last decade has helped save a lot of HIV infected people. Since its initiation at the Government General Hospital in 2005, over 7,705 patients have registered till now. ART consists of a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs to suppress the HIV virus and stop the progression of the disease. (*Names changed)"

Earlier this year, the private firm forced him to resign with a monetary compensation. Adding to his woes, a legislation that promises to punish such discrimination has been in the works for several years now. The HIV/AIDS Bill was drafted in 2006, but is being shunted between the health and law ministries. Activists, lawyers and people living with HIV have been fighting for the Bill to be introduced during the winter session of Parliament. Rallies are planned across the country to highlight the issue on Sunday, World AIDS Day. A senior National AIDS Control Organisation official told TOI that the Bill was now with the Cabinet. The Bill will provide protection against discrimination in employment, education, healthcare, travel, and insurance. “It brings the private sector within its ambit. We want the Bill to be introduced in Parliament during the winter session so that it does not lapse after the general elections,” said Surekha Shetty, Legal and Advocacy Officer, Lawyers Collective. It’s a constant struggle for those living with HIV/AIDS against social stigma. Many HIV positive children are put in schools without their condition being disclosed. “A 22- year-old girl was born with HIV as her parents were HIV positive. She completed school and college because her grandparents told the management that she had cancer,” says Dr Lakshmi Bhai, CEO, DESH, an NGO working with HIV positive people. “Hospitals refuse to perform surgeries. They would never tell us directly that we are being denied treatment because we are infected,” says D Pari, secretary, Network for Chennai people living with HIV/AIDS. The first line and second line of treatment should free as per the NACO and WHO guidelines, but non-availability of second line drugs is a life threatening issue, say infected people. “Only four hospitals in TN provide second line drugs, and they are expensive. A few places continue to give anti-retroviral drugs with a combination of stavudine, which was banned by WHO as it has several side effects. The Bill will deal with such problems quickly,” says Daisy David, a HIV positive advocacy officer of World Vision. "

In a gap of just two years, the rate of new HIV infection has reduced by nearly 30-35 % in some of the centres of the state. Statistics of Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society show that in 2012 and till January 2013, about 656 new cases of HIV were registered for anti-retroviral therapy at the King George's Medical University while the figure stood at 1,444 in 2010. Likewise, 1,818 new persons were put on anti-retroviral therapy in 2012 and till January 2013 at IMS Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Not in keeping with this falling trend, however, 3,162 new cases were reported in 2010 for ART at IMS BHU. But, other government centres of the state witnessed a significant fall in new cases of HIV infection. Not only UP, the similar trend has also been witnessed in the country. The recently released UNAIDS Report 2013 stated that India has managed to reduce new HIV infections by 57% between 2001 and 2012. Health experts attributed increased public awareness as one of the main reasons behind the fall in number of new HIV cases being reported. ""Due to various educational programmes, people have become more aware about HIV/AIDS. More and more patients in both government and private hospitals insist on use of new needle for injection,"" said A K Tripathi, head of department of clinical haematology. The other reason is improvement in blood bank services as blood is now checked thoroughly before transfusion. ""The ban on sale of blood has helped a lot,"" said Dr Tripathi. Another major cause is the widespread availability of ART which suppressed the HIV virus and stops the progression of HIV disease. Earlier, ART was available at only a few hospitals of the state but now UP has 22 centres and many district hospitals are linked to centres where HIV persons can get the medicines. ""Due to ART, the situation has now become better than earlier. There has been decline in rate of new HIV infections and it will reduce more in the coming days,"" said Preetam Kaur, president of Lucknow Positive Women Welfare Society. Kaur added, ""We have come even closer to ensuring that children born to mothers with HIV are delivered without contracting the disease. If a pregnant woman with HIV is getting treatment and delivery at a government hospital, children born to them are negative."""

The latest report of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) has reported 116 cases of the infection across 30 jails in the state between January and October this year, as against 330 cases that were reported in 2011. This year, the highest number of cases was reported from Thane Central Jail, followed by Adharwadi Jail in Kalyan. Fifteen cases were detected in Yerawada Central Jail, the third-highest number of cases. In all, 17 jails reported HIV cases. ""Of the 15,228 jail inmates who volunteered to get themselves tested for HIV this year, 116 tested positive. Forty five have been put on antiretroviral treatment because of low CD4 count,"" an MSACS official said. The CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. The virus attacks these cells and uses them to spread, which weakens the immune system. Officials of MSACS said that jail inmates are regularly informed about the causes of spread of HIV and counselled to reduce risks. ""We have trained counsellors who help spread awareness about HIV infection among prisoners and encourage them to get themselves tested. This has resulted in reducing the number of cases over the years,"" said an official of MSACS. Prisoners contract diseases that are determined both by the environment they come from and also the prison they live in, say experts. If adequate treatment is not given to inmates in jails, they will return to the community further burdening the existing healthcare facilities of the country, say experts. ""The jail inmates are among the most vulnerable population to contract HIV infection due to homosexual relations and through contaminated needles which are used for injecting recreational drugs,"" said senior scientist Ramesh Paranjape, director of National AIDS Research Institute (NARI). Experts note that the prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to high-risk activities, such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men. ""When people living with HIV are released from incarceration and return to their sexual and/or needle-sharing partners in the community, their partners face increased risk of HIV infection while they may not be aware that they are at risk,"" said A L Kakrani, professor and head, department of medicine, D Y Patil Medical College. A recent UNAIDS report said the HIV epidemic in Asia was concentrated largely among people who inject drugs, sex workers and their clients, and MSMs (men having sex with men)."

Statistics from the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) suggest that Nagpur district may well be on its way to achieve this target. Officials credit better awareness through various means for bringing about this change. Between the years 2002 and 2012, the transmission of the disease from parents to children has gone down from 1.10% to 0.25%. The fall of HIV being detected among people walking into the voluntary counseling and testing centres (VCTC) was even more dramatic, from a whopping 33.55% to a meagre 3.50%. DAPCU has been running various targeted interventions focused on population groups more prone to fall prey to the infection. A team of more than 500 people associated with DAPCU also moves around in various parts of the district imparting knowledge about the disease and its preventive measures through lectures, street plays, skits and brochures. ""From the time we started the ART centre here, in 2001, till today the rate of positivity (or people who are HIV positive) is decreasing progressively. Several misconceptions about AIDS were prevalent at that time which have gone away because of increased awareness, in which the internet has played a major part. Fear has now been replaced by knowledge,"" said Tanuja Fale, district programme officer of DAPCU. Along with our efforts, the credit for this development also goes to the many NGOs that we have partnered with over the years, she added. Targeted interventions include population groups like female sex workers, homosexuals, truckers and migrant workers. DAPCU team also organizes lectures in colleges, corporate firms, government organizations, and even jails. ""We also have a helpline that helps people who can not come to the counselling centres,"" said Fale."

Laxmi, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, had got married to man working in Mumbai. After marriage, she became pregnant. She came back to her native place to deliver the baby but medical tests revealed that she had acquired HIV. She gave birth to the child who, mercifully, was free of the virus. When she returned to her husband in Mumbai and told him that she had HIV, he threw her out and disowned her. With nowhere to go, she begged at Mumbai Railway station for a few days with her newborn baby. After two days, however, she returned to her parents. To her dismay, even her parents refused to let her into their house. Feeling helpless, Laxmi decided to come to Ahmedabad where her aunt (mausi) lived in Bapu Nagar locality. Her aunt accepted the baby but refused to let Laxmi live with her family. Telling herself that her child would at least have a home, the hapless mother gave the child to her aunt and left. Unable to live with the stigma of HIV and the social boycott that came with the disease, Laxmi decided to end her life. She went to Kalupur Railway station with the thought of jumping in front of a train. But at the railway station she came across the signboard of the NGO, Adhar, which helps HIV positive people cope with the disease. The NGO also runs a marriage bureau for HIV positive people. It helped Laxmi get married for a second time. The UP woman is now married and lives a normal life in Ahmedabad. Laxmi and her husband have decided not to have children. Meanwhile, Laxmi's first husband has died of Aids.(Name has been changed to protect the identity)"

The PhD thesis of a professor at H K College in Ahmedabad, titled, 'Social problems faced by HIV positive people and their solutions', reveals that most patients are disowned by their families and, due to social boycott, find it difficult to get work and earn a living. Alpesh Prajapati, who did his PhD from Gujarat Vidyapith, surveyed a sample of 110 patients for his research. Most of them had been disowned by their respective families, neighbours and friends. The research also reveals that the hostility of society towards such patients has led to the creation of 'silent groups' of patients. These people have been diagnosed as being HIV positive but they do not reveal it and live with the disease as normal men and women. People with HIV find it difficult to make a living if it is known that they are infected. Thus patients find themselves fighting on many fronts at the same time. The worst impact is on the women who are found to have the Aids virus. Alpesh spent four years on research and suggested that a lot has to be done to spread awareness among people to remove the stigma attached to HIV. He has suggested that awareness programmes should be held at schools and in colleges."

Of the 16,325 HIV positive cases detected in state, in last one decade (2003-to date), 39% fall in this age group. While men constitute a majority, 39% of these infected people are women and 8% are children under 14. As per figures provided by State AIDS Control Society (SACS), number of HIV positive cases has been rising consistently and considerably since 2003. The considerable rise is mainly due to increased awareness about the disease and the wide network of testing labs, which were almost non-existent till a decade ago. In 2003, the state on an average, recorded 3 cases per month, which went up to 125 in 2008 and stands at 252 cases as of date. The number of cases recorded per month in 2009 was 182, 190 in 2010, 213 in 2011 and 242 in 2012. According to the latest data of this fiscal (2013-14), the highest number of HIV positive cases was detected in Raipur, Durg and Bilaspur. Of the 9,825 people tested in Raipur, 466 were found to be HIV positive. Similarly, in Durg and Bilaspur, a total of 15,055 and 20,718 were tested and 298 and 288 were found HIV positive respectively. Talking to TOI, Kshitiz Diwan, SACS official, attributed the rise in number of cases to increased awareness and availability of testing centers. He said since 2008, testing centers have more than doubled from 52 to 111 in 2013. Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, said there is a need for people with HIV to lead a normal life and contribute to the society, regardless of their infection. He said almost 90 per cent of women get infected with HIV/AIDS from their husband. Thus, there is a dire need for behavioral control and attitude among men. At present, 5,069 people are taking treatment at ART centers. However, 11,782 people affected with AIDS were registered but more than 50% dropped the treatment midway."

As a child, Kaveri lost her parents to AIDS, and ever since, has been under her grandmother's care. Seeing Kaveri married tops her aging grandma's priority list. But she faces a dilemma: even if she does find a match, the man would either be a widower or someone twice as old as Kaveri. ""These adolescent girls face a bleak future if they end up into forced marriages. More often than not, they are left with a single parent who wants to get them married quickly,"" says Saroja Putran, a member of the HIV-infected community.

Around 1,024 patients have been found infected with the virus till November this year as against last year's 1,824. The parent-to-child virus transmission has also come down from 67 in 2012 to 23 this year. There are four anti-retroviral treatment centres (ARTs) and link ARTs across the district to clinically examine the suspected patients. After a person is tested positive, the ART medication starts at the earliest. Jagdish Patil, the regional programme officer of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), told TOI, ""We are targeting those in the high-risk groups such as male and female sex workers, and trans genders, who are most vulnerable, to spread the awareness about the syndrome. As this group is brought under control, the spread of the virus to the secondary population, such as spouses and children of these people, also decreases. We have brought around 90% infected people to ART centres to provide medication which has significantly reduced the spread."" The District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), along with the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), is going to conduct a survey among those engaged in cutting of sugarcane for HIV infection. ""The sugar cutters are mostly migratory workers and considered the bridge-population for the virus to spread. However, there is no study about how much these people contribute to the spread of virus. However, the population has the potential risk of transmitting the virus through unsafe sex,"" Patil added. Along with the decline in the AIDS cases among the general masses, the district has also recorded a dip in in the parent-to-child transmission of the virus. ""Last year, about 67 children were infected through their HIV -positive mother. This year, the number has been significantly declined because of te co-ordinating efforts of private and public anti-natal care centres. A single-dose regimen of Nevirapin has reduced the transmission rate from 30% to 11%. We will start the triple drug regimen that can bring down the rate further to 2-5%,"" Patil said."

Despite this, Nidhi Patel (24) married him recently. It was a love marriage and Nidhi says her love is blind, but positively. In fact, when Vimal spoke about his marriage with a physician, he was told to avoid tying the knot. The doctor advised lying about his HIV status would be unethical and unjust to the girl. He was surprised to know that Nidhi, who knew Vimal for three years, was aware of his disease but determined to marry the Ahmedabad-based sales executive. “I refused to believe my patient and asked him to bring his girlfriend along for counseling. I thought the girl was probably blinded by love and did not know the seriousness of the disease,’’ said infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel. “I was surprised to meet the girl who was aware of the challenges of living with an HIV infected person. In fact, she was adamant that she would not let HIV be an obstacle to her love.’’ The marriage is a personal victory of love. But it reflects changing attitudes related to HIV patients as well. Experts say a decade ago, they would have to grapple with not only the physical and mental fallouts of the dreaded infection but also emotional manifestations of the being abandoned out of fear. At least two of every 10 patients would be divorced and many disowned by their families. “The current social scenario for HIV patients is far more positive. Not only do we see a lot of HIV positive patients marrying each other, we are also seeing boys and girls with no infection willingly marrying HIV positive people. This trend signifies a greater acceptance of HIV in society and the fact that HIV is not a death sentence. It is a disease which can be managed with good treatment and care,” said Dr Patel. Sunita, 28, is another person, who married her boyfriend of two years, despite knowing he is HIV positive. In fact, Sunita’s mother consulted a physician with her to dissuade her. But she prevailed saying she would like to find out how she could live happily with an HIV positive person. She also got married recently. Advisory for HIV discordant couples * An HIV discordant couple is where one spouse is HIV negative. * In such cases, infectious diseases experts say safe sex should be practiced. If the viral load is non-traceable in a blood test, the couple can try for a baby during the fertile period * At least two international studies reveal that if the person is on proper HIV medication and the HIV load is untraceable in blood tests, the HIV infection is not spread through sex and other contact * When the discordant couple is trying for a baby using unprotected sex, prophylactic anti-viral treatment can be given to the negative spouse "

According to the officials, around 250 HIV positive deliveries take place in Vizag district every year. As per the PPCT treatment, HIV testing is conducted on all pregnant women and if found positive, anti-retroviral treatment (ART) is administered from the 14th week of pregnancy, irrespective of the CD4 count. Right after birth, Nevirapine and Septran syrup are given to the baby. Blood tests (DBS-PCR tests) are also done from time to time till the child is one-and-half-years old. If the child tests HIV negative, then he or she can be said to be free from HIV transmission. Breastfeeding is also encouraged since the mother is kept on ART drugs. Additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said, ""Currently, around 8,000 HIV positive pregnant women are undergoing ART in Vizag as per the government records. We are focusing on zero vertical transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn and therefore implementing PPCT in every possible antenatal case. This advanced drug regime was introduced on September 2012 as a pilot project in AP and Karnataka and now the success rate is almost 98%. We will soon conduct sensitization workshops for private gynaecologists so that PPCT is followed in every case."" Besides a decrease in vertical transmission in antenatal cases, focus is given on bringing down HIV-TB co-infections. ""Since HIV patients develop tuberculosis as an opportunistic infection, we are focusing on such patients too so that incidence of HIV-TB can be brought down. The three ART centres and 15 Link ART centres in the district along with a few NGOs are playing a crucial role in controlling HIV in newborns and TB patients due to timely treatment,"" added the ADMHO. T Kailashaditya, joint director (targeted intervention), AP State AIDS Control Society, said, ""With greater awareness about HIV, health seeking behaviour among high risk groups as well as the public has gone up.

A UNICEF report says that AIDS-related deaths amongst adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 increased by 50% between 2005 and 2012, rising from 71,000 to 110,000 and that many adolescents were unaware that they were infected. The 2013 Stocktaking Report on Children and AIDS—released on the occasion of World AIDS on Sunday-- says that an estimated 74% of the 2.1 million adolescents live in 12 high burden countries. It says that investments to the tune of USD 5.5 billion by next year will be required to avoid an added two million adolescents, particularly girls, becoming infected by 2020. Investments in 2010 were US$3.8 billion. “If high-impact interventions are scaled up using an integrated approach, we can halve the number of new infections among adolescents by 2020,” said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. “It’s a matter of reaching the most vulnerable adolescents with effective programmes – urgently.” The report also found that girls are more vulnerable among adolescents. Of the total of 2.1 million individuals, 1.2 million are females. The total infected adolescent population in South Asia is 130,000 with 51% men and 49% women. Much more attention is needed to prevent and treat HIV during adolescence, so that children remain AIDS-free in the second decade of life. New infections among adolescents could be halved by 2020 by scaling up high-impact interventions and working across sectors. The treatment, care and support needs of children living with HIV change as they grow older and begin to take greater responsibility for their own health. But services generally do not keep pace with or cater to their needs. This is particularly true for marginalized adolescents males who have sex with males, adolescents who inject drugs and sexually exploited adolescents despite the disproportionately high prevalence of HIV among them. Experts have advised a combination of high-impact interventions including condoms, antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, voluntary medical male circumcision, communications for behaviour change, and targeted approaches for at-risk and marginalized populations. This is in addition to investments in other sectors such as education, social protection and welfare, and strengthening health systems. "

Just when United Nations AIDS (UNAIDS) has praised India for reducing new HIV infection rate by 57% in a decade, news from Mumbai shows that the number of patients put on life-saving drugs has almost doubled in the last five years. Figures released by the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) on the eve of World AIDS Day show that 36,920 HIV patients in the city have been put on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) over the years. The therapy has been instrumental in changing the perception of AIDS from being a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease. ""This is a 96.2% increase in the number of patients taking ART since 2008,"" said Dr B Adsul, additional project director at MDACS. The numbers show that the AIDS-control programme is spreading wider into the community. The city's government-aided AIDS control programme has registrations of 67,326 patients across the city. ""In the last five years, we have managed to increase the number of patients coming to us for treatment by 60%,'' added Dr Adsul. That HIV-positive individuals are living healthier lives can be gauged from the fact almost 40% of the registered patients don't need ART yet, said a MDACS official. This means their blood counts aren't yet plunging to levels that need ART,'' they said. The MDACS, which works under the civic bodymunicipal corporation of Greater Mumbai, operates 69 centres for testing and counselling patients as well as 10 centres to distribute ART medicines.

Surve, art director at a leading publishing house, pledged to support Dhawale, 38, in her fight to lift the stigma off AIDS, and gradually tweak the mindset of those around them by being a model ‘mixed status’ couple. And that’s not the only stereotype they are crashing. Dhawale is no emaciated, drawn HIV victim. She fills up the room when she hurries in. “I can’t hear,” she says, motioning to her hearing aid. Her eardrums were damaged in a car accident when she was three. But her hardest struggle has been to fight the stigma that came with the HIV virus she contracted eight years ago due to medical negligence. The three abortions she underwent between 2004 and 2006 (“Oral contraceptive made me nauseous and my ex-husband didn’t care for condoms”) did her in. The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used. “Poz? Me? Not possible. There has to be a mistake,” she writes on her blog, recounting receiving the test results when she went in for her fourth abortion. That she had destroyed records of all three previous surgeries meant she couldn’t hold anyone accountable. “The nursing home staff suggested I have the baby because it was my last chance due to the complications the serial abortions had led to.” Until then, Dhawale admits, she knew nothing about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus which triggers the progressive failure of the immune system, allowing life-threatening infections to thrive. “I thought it only happened to those with multiple partners. I didn’t have them, neither did my husband.” The Vasai clinic she delivered her baby at (he is seven years old now), administered Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, to prevent transmission of virus from mother to child. Her marriage ended in 2007 — “due to incompatibility, not the infection”, she clarifies — making her isolation complete. The counselling centre run by Kripa Foundation that she was directed to was ill equipped to empower patients with accurate information about medicine dosage, side effects or the nature of the virus. She realised she had to know more. The online information space was one she chose to dip into between 2010 and 2011, sparking off her transformation. Dhawale learnt that virus transmission didn’t stand a chance if partners stayed healthy and the infected person kept the virus count low with medication. “In India, abstinence is the only solution experts offer,” she says, recounting how an ‘AIDS specialist’ she visited in 2012 advised Surve, who was then her boyfriend, against kissing her. “He even suggested we wear gloves while being intimate. Even if traces of the virus exist in the saliva, it cannot be transmitted unless one or both partners have bleeding gums or open sores. It’s the same during oral sex unless one partner suffers from an STD or the viral load is at a detectable level,” she clarifies. In fact, it was during her time online that she met Surve. The two hit it off, and eventually she told him she was HIV+ve. “He disappeared for three months,” she giggles. “I was shocked,” he says. “But not a single day went by when I did not think of her.” Surve, who Dhawale says on her blog, had dilly dallied for two-anda-half years, offered a commitment this August when she was ironically preparing to participate at an HIV matrimonial meet in Pune. Expectedly, there was resistance from Surve’s family. After all, she had a ‘sex worker’s’ disease. “We tell people on a need-to-know basis, and educate them on how it’s transmitted,” says Surve, who admits that it’s family and close friends who are aware that they are a serodiscordent couple. That Dhawale never let the virus rob her vivacity has made sure the couple enjoy a “rocking, fearless but protected sex life”. “There are procedures to follow in case of a condom tear, pills you can take within 72 hours of the act, under the doctor’s guidance,” explains Surve. Their constant effort is to keep the virus load down, reducing any chance of transmission. The medicines that Dhawale takes twice a day at times so precise, the couple set an alarm for it, are personalised based on her lifestyle, and blood, liver parameters. “If you miss a dose, the virus will multiply. If you overdose, the hormones go for a toss,” he says. Does the fear of untimely death hang over the couple? “With proper exercise, diet and medication,” he says, “an HIV+ve person can outlive an HIV-ve one. We are making sure Jyoti does.”Ways to prevention Always use a condom. Have your partner tested for HIV before engaging in a physical relationship and/or marriage. Insist that labs, clinics and hospitals use disposable syringes and screens."

Bridge populations such as migrants and truckers are mainly responsible for the spread of the virus in the state. According to the HIV Sentinel Surveillance carried out by the Assam State AIDS Control Society (ASACS), the overall HIV prevalence among antenatal attendees was recorded at 0.16 per cent in 2012-13, as opposed to 0.09 per cent in 2010-11. In 2008, the prevalence of the virus among antenatal attendees was recorded at 0.13 per cent. Addressing a meeting on the eve of World AIDS Day on Saturday, state epidemiologist of ASACS Chiranjeev Bhattacharjee said, ""In Assam, a rising trend in HIV prevalence, especially among pregnant women, has been observed but it is still lower when compared to other groups. The evidence suggests that the HIV epidemic in the state is mainly driven by bridge populations such as migrants and the truckers."" He said the absence of sentinel sites to monitor HIV prevalence among truckers and migrants is responsible for the limited data on their role in the spread of HIV from high risk groups to the general populace. Assam has about 8,580 HIV positive cases, out of which around 5,229 are male, 2948 are female, seven are transgender and 396 are children."
159,12,2013,Sharp rise in HIV among adolescents,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/Sharp-rise-in-HIV-among-adolescents/articleshow/26685629.cms,"LUDHIANA: Sitting in front of her counsellor, a nervous Richa rubs her hands and hesitates, as a number of questions pop up in her mind about her health. Richa is just 18 and had been diagnosed with HIV positive. And like Richa, several youngsters in their adolescence had been diagnosed with HIV in the last one and a half years. According to the data available with the Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) Centre in civil hospital, about 500 patients aged 15 and 24 years, under the category of adolescents, have been admitted since the last one-and-a-half years. According to the present report, there are 3,700 patients being treated at the ART centre in Ludhiana, out of which 500 are adolescents between the age group of 15 and 24. Two major hospitals- Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and Christian Medical College and Hospital in the city also report their HIV positive cases to the ART centre. These numbers have varied during the last four year since the ART centre was launched on December 17, 2009. Initially, the ART centre used to receive about 10-20 cases of adolescents over the years. But now the figures have increased and the centre currently treats 500 registered cases. Talking about the tremendously increasing figures of HIV positive among the adolescents in last four years in city centre, Gurjit Singh, SMO, ART centre, said, ""At present, around 500 cases of HIV positive in adolescents are being treated here. According to data, there are two major reasons that have been found to be the reason behind the disease a?? the first being drug abuse and the second being unprotected sex or sex with more than one partner."" According to experts, an overview of the data reveals that out of the 3,700 HIV cases being treated, 87% are cases of sexual infection, 5-10% of drug abuse, and others due to infection from mother to child and blood transfusion. In case of adolescents, 70% cases happen due to sexual activity and rest due to drug abuse. Vikas Garg, assistant professor medicine from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said, ""We receive about 10-20 HIV patients every month, of which adolescents make up for the major number of confirmed cases. The reason behind the increase in these cases is that even after widespread awareness about HIV/AIDS, people do not take it seriously. Drug abuse as the major reason in city had been spreading fast among the adolescents. They mainly get affected by sharing the used syringes, which many a times may be infected. And as the infected person is more prone to opportunistic infections, it leads to other diseases."" Talking about the root cause of cases, Navjot Singh, professor and unit head department of medicine, CMC, said, ""There is only one way to cure this problem, which is by starting treatment as soon as it is diagnosed. Although, an HIV positive person is mostly left with little time, proper and timely treatment can help improve many cases."" Besides this, some homosexual cases too had been registered, but their numbers could be said to be in negligible condition in the state and city. An overview of data from the Civil Hospital shows that when the ART centre started diagnosing HIV cases, about 720 cases were reported, while now the numbers have increased to 3,700 in the city. "
160,12,2013,Dakshina Kannada shows dramatic dip in HIV prevalence,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/Dakshina-Kannada-shows-dramatic-dip-in-HIV-prevalence/articleshow/26688066.cms,"MANGALORE: From being a red zone for HIV infection a decade back, Dakshina Kannada district has moved towards 0.25% prevalence, which is half of state's estimated adult HIV prevalence. ""The positive cases have come down drastically by more than half from 2007 numbers. If the positive cases were about 1,245 in 2007 about 90 cases being reported per month, including pregnant women, now the cases are averaging less 50 per month,"" said Dr Kishore Kumar M, District AIDS Control officer. He pointed out that while in 2007, the test to positive ration was 16% in 2013 it has come to as low as 1.45%. Delineating the statistics, he said, ""In 2007 of the 7,986 persons tested 1,245 were tested positive, in 2013 (till October end) of the 38,985 tested only 567 were positive cases. Last year, as many as 38,294 went in for testing and there were 867 cases. This year, we expect the test number to reach 44,000,"" he said. Dr Kishore said the positive development was that every year from 2007 the cases were coming down by more than 100, hoping to achieve better progress in next couple of years. The most heartening fact is the effective control of transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy. Nearly five per cent of infections are attributable to parent-to-child-transmission. Dr Kishore pointed out that froma high of 82 cases in 2007 among 14,764 pregnant women tested, the numbers had come down to 23 in 2012 among 23,575 tested. This year till October 21 cases have been reported among 22,141 tested. Among the cases reported this year till October, Mangalore taluk has the highest number at 214, followed by Bantwal (51), Belthangady (45), Puttur 927) and Sullia taluk reported 15 cases. The rest of the 215 cases are from other districts tested here. Again male numbers are high at 364 followed by women at 203. The prevalence among persons in the age group of 15 to 49 is highest at 472 and it is 80 above age of 49. As of now, from 2006 till date 2,492 persons are being administered ART (Anti-Retroviral Treatment). Dr Kishore said HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3. Earlier the threshold was 250. Antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis. "
161,12,2013,Triple drug regimen to bring down HIV cases,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Triple-drug-regimen-to-bring-down-HIV-cases/articleshow/26709041.cms,"NAGPUR: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared its intention to bring down the number of new cases of HIV/AIDS to zero by the year 2015. Accordingly, a new drug regimen which will have three instead of one drug is being adopted in Maharashtra and some other states from this World AIDS Day. For those children who have acquired the infection, efforts are being made to improve their quality of life, and thus chances of longevity. This was the crux of the discussion among the city's medical fraternity during a sensitization workshop organized by city branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). International consultant on HIV/AIDS from Pune Dr Vinay Kulkarni, noted physician from the city Dr Milind Bhurshundi, associate professor at IGGMC Dr Kshama Kedar and Manish Mudliar from SAATHI (Solidarity and Action Against The HIV Infection in India) were the faculties. ""Since the new regimen will come into practice soon, we wanted our members to know about the changes in treatment modalities,"" said IMA, Nagpur president Dr Warsha Dhawale. Explaining the new regimen and the reason for introducing it, Dr Kedar who is also the chairperson of IMA's HIV committee said, ""For preventing the transmission of virus from mother to child, we give the mother only one drug. Resistance has developed against this drug in the virus, so we will start administering three drugs to pregnant positive women."" Primary prevention measure must be to avoid unwanted pregnancy and monitor a planned one in an HIV positive woman, said Dr Kulkarni. ""Once infected, it is important to link them to proper care and treatment. The new programme seems much more efficient than the previous one. Its success, however, would depend on the extent of patients covered. The most important thing is to screen all pregnant women for HIV and link all patients to proper facilities,"" he said. Along with this, stress must be given on adolescent counselling to prevent new cases of the disease as India is among the top 12 countries as far as load of HIV-positive adolescents are concerned, said Dr Kedar. Agreed Dr Bhurshundi and added, ""Though the prevalence of HIV is decreasing, there is another alarming trend to be concerned about. Most people affected by the disease are in the 18-24 age group and yet there is not much research or stress on these patients."" He also warned that affected people should lay clear off quacks who claim that they can be rid of the virus. ""Instead of being stringent about one's drug schedule and following doctors' instructions can improve one's quality of life tremendously,"" said Dr Bhurshundi. THE NEW REGIMEN Instead of a single drug to patient when she is in labour, a triple drug regimen to be used This will help in countering the resistance developing in the virus so as to suppress viral load during birth Earlier, patients with CD4 below 250 were put on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Now the limit has been raised to 350 Provision for ART for all children with HIV under 5 years of age, all pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV, and to all HIV-positive couples where one partner is uninfected, irrespective of CD4 count"
162,12,2013,Govt hospitals pose HIV risk for doctors,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Govt-hospitals-pose-HIV-risk-for-doctors/articleshow/26709126.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM: A dermatologist who runs a private clinic in Kakinada reveals that at least 10% of the HIV positive patients he treats comprise doctors and medical staff who have contracted the deadly virus while working in government hospitals. ""The number is quite alarming. But there's no way to prove that the virus has been transmitted through patients during surgeries or treatment even though the risk of contracting HIV is very high in government hospitals. Also, due to the stigma involved, the actual statistics never come out,"" the doctor informs. While private hospital doctors can choose to turn away patients who refuse to undergo HIV test prior to surgeries, there's no such option for doctors working in government hospitals. Legally, a patient can't be forced to undergo the HIV test. For operating on such patients, the medical team needs special protective and disposable gear, which may or may not be available always at state-run hospitals, exposing doctors and others in the operation theatre to the risk of contracting the deadly HIV virus. Taking elaborate safety precautions for all surgical cases is also not economically feasible, point out medical experts. Dr P V Sudhakar, head of the department of plastic surgery and deputy superintendent of King George Hospital (KGH), informs, ""Unlike private hospitals, we can't turn away a vulnerable patient who refuses to undertake HIV test prior to a surgery. So the entire surgical team needs to be alerted about the HIV status of the patient and accordingly, the doctors, medicos and other healthcare personnel associated with the surgery need to take special precautions, wear disposable synthetic gowns and double gloves but often government hospitals run out of special gears and HIV kits. Taking universal precautions for each and every case, assuming all of them to be HIV positive or Hepatitis B positive cases, may not be economically feasible."" The lack of gloves sometimes forces junior doctors or medicos to draw blood samples barehanded, a situation that clearly is alarming for them. Says a junior doctor from the hospital, ""After drawing blood samples barehanded due to the shortage of gloves, we do rush to take post-exposure prophylaxis. But this too is not recommended nor possible every time as these could be toxic drugs. There needs to be continuous supply of special gears and kits for dealing with HIV patients. The only other option for us is to purchase the disposable gloves from our pocket each time we assist in surgeries or draw blood."" When queried, Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) remarked, ""Indiscriminate HIV testing is not required prior to surgery for all patients. Naco (National Aids Control Organisation) has already prescribed testing for all pregnant women. Besides, high risk vulnerable groups and TB symptomatic patients should be tested for HIV before operations. Instead, doctors should rather opt for universal safety precautions while undertaking every surgery to curtail the risk of transmission."""

Since then, India and the world have come a long way. This year, the day was observed on the theme 'Getting to Zero,' i.e., zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero deaths. Speaking on the occasion on Sunday, renowned general physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a specialist in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, gave an insight into the latest advancements in the treatment of the disease. ""In 1987, the first HIV drug Zidovidene came into market. In 2000, HIV was transformed as a chronic manageable disease. In 2010, there was a breakthrough when HIV positive cancer patient Tim Brown turned HIV negative after stem cell therapy. Now, the focus of the world is on HIV cure. Safe sex, safe needle, safe blood, safe motherhood and respect for culture would prevent HIV/AIDS."" However, challenges still persist. ""In 2012, vaccine trial on monkeys to clear HIV from blood showed promise but is yet to be tested on human. HAART (Highly active anti-retroviral therapy), can help achieve a near-normal life and zero viremia (less than 50 viral copies per ml in the blood) is possible today. But unfortunately, the HIV in the body is in the latent stage, so the HAART is not able to reach the latent virus. Unless the drug comes to attack the latent virus, the HIV problem would persist. Studies on valopuric acid (to kill the latent virus) are inconclusive. So research on new molecules is in the pipeline,"" he said. Besides awareness programmes, Red Ribbon rallies organised by district medical and health authorities marked the World AIDS day in the city on Sunday. Around 500 medicos, nursing students and NCC cadets participated in the Red Ribbon Rally from Vuda complex to AU Engineering College. Besides, 25 visually impaired artistes also participated in an 'orchestra walk' on the occasion."

In 2012, 195 people out to 20,000 were found to be HIV positive after subjected to blood test. The figure was alarming, which put the health department in a tight spot. In 2013, blood samples of 21,833 people were tested in the district from April to till October and it was found that only 128 people were infected with deadly disease in district, which brought much-needed relief to the health department particularly the Aids Control Society run by the government in district. Of the total affected, 78 are males and remaining 50 are females. ""We are really happy that the number of HIV positive cases dropped in the district when compared to last year. We will check the results every month and take steps to prevent further spread of the disease,"" said an official. Gaurav Goel, consultant, internal medicine at Alchemist Hospital said, despite being home to the world's third-largest population suffering from HIV/AIDS, the AIDS prevalence rate in India is lower than in many other countries. ""Prevention is simple and the only answer we have, unless we find some cure,"" he added. Another doctor Charu Sachdeva, senior consultant internal medicine at Rockland hospital said there has been decline in cases due to improved therapy, increased awareness among people. People are aware that timely treatment can delay the disease and prevent opportunistic infections. ""Infected people should visit Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) clinics where they get counseling, nutrition advice and HIV prevention education and treatment for opportunistic infections"" she added. 60 percent cases are of unprotected sex 53% of cases in age-group of 30-44 years 26% cases in age group of 15-29 years Year wise cases 2013: 128 2012: 195 2011: 128 2010: 93"

A recent mortality investigation carried out by semi-government entity Institute of Actuaries of India on people living with HIV (PLHIV) shows among the deceased, the illiterate population make for the higher number, unprotected sex is still the commonest reason behind the transmission of HIV, those between 25 and 49 years of age bear 83% of the death burden and there is a significant time gap between a person getting infected and him/her seeking treatment. The study investigated 1,695 deaths between April 2012 and March 2013 in 20 ART centres of five districts, representative of the whole country. The study, carried out with support from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), is supposed to act as a guide for insurers to design the life insurance cover for PLHIV and price the risks accordingly. In its report, the IAI has suggested that CD4 count at the time of registering for ART, access to regular treatments and educational, economical and social backwardness were among major factors for longevity of life. It has recommended stricter data development and maintenance to NACO. The survey report underlines how the uneducated population contributes to 44% of the deaths, even though the rate of infection among them is only about 27%. Education, say experts, clearly has a defining role to play in HIV care but how and why is subject to further exploration. The report says the average time lost before a patient approaches a free anti-retroviral centre is about 7.4 months. “A delay in starting treatment could lead to faster deterioration of a patients’ health and s/he may also fall prey to opportunistic infections, like TB,” said a volunteer with one of the city’s 69 Integrated Testing and Counselling Centres. Most worryingly, the study revealed that in 90% of the deaths, the infection was transmitted through unprotected sex. A NACO official told TOI that despite the exponential success rate of condom use, unprotected sex remained a nagging worry. In Mumbai too, it is a challenge to check the transmission of the virus among high-risk groups such as men having sex with men (MSM). “Over the last five years, MSM in Mimbai has witnessed a drop of 88% in HIV transmission. But still, the infection rate among the high-risk group in the city is much higher than the national figure,” said Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society.

Health officials said the detection rate of new cases had dropped to 2.51% this year. Of the 99, 498 people who volunteered to undergo the HIV test between January and October this year, 2,500 people tested positive for HIV in Pune. Last year, 86,580 people had undergone the test and 2,808 people had tested positive with a detection rate of 3.24%. Aids Day was observed on Sunday Among those who tested positive for HIV this year, men accounted for the highest number of cases (1,329) followed by women (969) cases. Three cases of HIV infection were reported among transgenders. ""The number of new HIV infections in Pune city has fallen over the years. The steady efforts invested over a period of time to create awareness have started paying off. The theme of this year's AIDS Day is 'Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infection'. We are confident of achieving it,"" said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Rajiv Bamble, the city's nodal officer for prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, said, ""There is no denying the fact that awareness vis-à-vis HIV/AIDS has gone up considerably over a period of time. More and more people are coming forward to screen themselves and seek counselling."" The civic body is going to launch another antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre at Rajeev Gandhi Hospital in Yerawada with the help from Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). There are 11 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) and three ART centres in Pune An ICTC is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, of his own free will or as advised by a medical care provider. There are now more than 4,000 counselling and testing centres in India, mainly in government hospitals. In Maharashtra, there are 578 ICTCs where testing and counselling is provided free. An ICTC conducts HIV diagnostic tests, providing basic information on the modes of HIV transmission, promoting behavioural change to reduce vulnerability, and link people with other HIV prevention, care and treatment services. Between 2011-2015, AIDS Days would focus not only on bringing new HIV infection count to zero, but also on removing discrimination and bringing down AIDS related deaths."

The HIV-2 strain, is common in west African countries like Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ghana and is rarely found outside the African continent. The HIV-2 virus, is considered more vicious compared to the HIV-1 virus. In the last six months alone, about 67 samples sent to Institute of Preventive Medicines (IPM) by the APSACS (Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society) have tested positive. Furthermore, dozens of samples are currently awaiting confirmation for the presence of the virus. The IPM uses the more accurate western blot method for detection of the virus. Even private hospitals are getting cases of patients affected with the virus. ""It is a fact that few even in the medical profession are not adequately informed about the HIV-2 virus,"" said Sunita Narreddy from the infection diseases specialty of Apollo Hospitals where about five cases of HIV-2 were recorded this year. ""Though HIV-1 and HIV-2 belong to the same family, the two differ in terms of their testing methodologies and treatment. Testing is comparatively easier for the HIV-1 virus unlike the HIV-2 virus. Also, there are better treatment options for HIV-1 virus compared to the latter,"" said Narreddy. Although the method of transmission for both the viruses is same, medicines to treat HIV-1 patients do not work for HIV-2 patients. This explains the fact that there are currently no medicines that the government is prescribing for HIV-2 patients. ""Medicines for treating HIV-2 virus are still in the testing stages, There are no approved drugs that work for this virus anywhere in the world. Hence, we cannot risk a patient's life by administering any drugs at this point of time,"" said a government official of the state health department. In India, there have been a few cases of HIV-2 being reported from some pockets in and around Mumbai. ""We cannot explain how this virus spread to this state. But, the numbers are higher in certain areas of Guntur district."" said a member of an organization working on the HIV programmes. There have also been some cases of the same person carrying both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 virus. According to the state records, about 5 lakh people have been identified as HIV positive in the state."
169,12,2013,Gay sex: Body blow to fight against HIV/AIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Gay-sex-Body-blow-to-fight-against-HIV/AIDS/articleshow/27230459.cms,"CHENNAI/MUMBAI/DELHI: The Supreme Court’s decision to reinstate a colonial-era ban on gay sex is not just a blow to homosexual rights, but also to HIV/AIDS medical intervention programmes, say doctors. Dr Dilip Mathai, vice president of the AIDS Society of India, said the SC verdict was a setback for medical care for HIV patients who are men who have sex with men (MSMs). “Our focus is to minimise new cases, but this verdict will make the act more clandestine and prevent doctors from reaching out to gay men who have HIV,” explained Dr Mathai. He added: “The homosexual act will not disappear but the community seeking help will reduce drastically. Now while treating male patients, doctors cannot ask, ‘Have you indulged in sex with a man,’ and this will have a major impact on detecting new cases.” Dr Kabir Sardana of Delhi’s Maulana Azad Medical College too said that gay patients suffering from STDs may no longer report their illness for fear of being branded an outlaw. In one of its report, the Human Rights Watch had highlighted the bitter truth that India’s battle against HIV/AIDS was made harder by the criminality attached to vulnerable communities. Some of the challenges underscored were thankfully overcome owing to the Delhi HC ruling in 2009 decriminalising gay sex. But, with the latest SC verdict, the obstacles will get resurrected. The issue is particularly pressing. MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. About 7% of the estimated 25-lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalization in healthcare was in fact the basis of the public interest litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in Delhi HC. The National AIDS Control Organisation too had conceded in the HC that Section 377 seriously impeded successful public health interventions. “Those in the high-risk group are reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to the fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground, making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,” stated the affidavit. The Human Rights Watch report cited an instance from July 2001, when four NGO staffers in Lucknow working to fight HIV/AIDS among MSMs were arrested and charged under IPC Section 377 (unnatural offences) and for selling obscene material. They were imprisoned for 47 days. Their literature was seized. And the offices of their two NGOs, Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust, were sealed. The harassment they suffered has been endured over the years by scores of other health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi. “This (verdict) will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days, it was very hard to get MSMs to health units, as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgment,” said Dr L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India. Dr Ramakrishnan said the SC ruling was likely to give legal backing to the biases of some healthcare professionals and fuel their discriminatory attitudes. The Anti Retroviral Therapy centre in the Government General Hospital in Chennai had seen a rise in gay patients with HIV coming to them for treatment after the Delhi HC verdict in 2009. “The number MSMs approaching NGOs doubled from 4% to 8%,” said a senior doctor at the hospital. Bhavana, programme manager of Sahodaran, a male sexual health project, said: “If homosexuality is legalised, we can freely distribute condoms to same sex couples. It would have also encouraged people to come out. This verdict will have a negative impact on intervention programmes.” (With inputs from Kamini Mathai, Madhavi Rajadhyaksha, Durgesh Nandan Jha) "
170,12,2013,'Taking HIV to zero target may now remain a dream',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Taking-HIV-to-zero-target-may-now-remain-a-dream/articleshow/27232096.cms," NAGPUR: The World AIDS Day was recently observed, with India gushing over reduction in the number of new cases of HIV/AIDS, patting its back for the commendable health schemes being run for this aim. At the focus of most such programmes is what is coded as MSM, or men having sex with men. Will criminalizing of homosexuality mean that these activities become illegal, too? Will this mean that the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) would require dropping this huge and vulnerable population group out of their future plans? Such questions are haunting several individuals and organizations working towards HIV awareness and reduction. ""For decades, we have worked towards bringing out the hidden population of LGBTQ community to speak about their sexual problems in order to bring down the number of HIV cases amongst them. Now, even if we were to go somewhere to create awareness or discuss a project, it would be likened to encouraging an illegal activity,"" said Kunal Maind, programme manager of NGO Saarthi Trust. This will result in an increase in HIV cases as gay people would fear to come out, which ultimately will be the society's loss, he added. Questioning the intent and legality of the services and counselling provided to the community by these NGOs is a major worry among them. ""Our field workers are scared that if they go out for any awareness activity, the society will not accept them. Most importantly, they fear for their safety as police or anti-social elements can exploit this situation,"" said Amitgiri Goswami, project manager of GAURAV TI project. In the absence of follow-up of this very vulnerable group of population and awareness among them, there would be an increase in the risk factors, thus taking up the number of people affected by the infection, he feared. ""Awareness about safe sex has remained limited to the urban areas till now,"" said Vishal Gajbhiye of NGO Aborigine Bahuuddeshiya Sanstha that had taken up a project to spread this awareness to the rural areas in August. ""In the last three months, we have found 4 positive cases out of 55 random check ups we did. None of them knew anything about safe sex options.

The health ministry’s data shows that outreach programmes have helped bring down HIV prevalence in high-risk communities like transgender (TG), men having sex with men (MSM) among others. HIV prevalence for transgender has come down from 42.21% in 2006 to 8.82% in 2011, while for MSMs the figure has declined from 8.74% to 4.43%. Targeted intervention for high-risk communities are priority of the Rs 8632.77 crore National AIDS Control Programme Phase-IV approved by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) in October. The stated objective of NACP-IV is to reduce new infections by 50% and intensify and consolidate prevention services with a focus on high-risk groups and vulnerable population and the general population. According to NGO, Humsafar Trust, which is active in outreach programmes for the LGBT community, about 7.5 lakh people are being reached through the health ministry initiative. “The government’s programme has brought down HIV prevalence by 57% in high risk groups. But now we have gone 20 years behind. Our outreach workers had the blanket of the High Court order when they went out for awareness generation and interventions. Now, they will be harassed,’’ Vivek Anand from Mumbai based Humsafar Trust said. Naz Foundation executive director, Anjali Gopalan, said access to health and educational facilities were bound to be impacted adversely. According to a World Bank report while India is increasing the coverage of targeted interventions for the most at risk populations, it will be critical to sustain these efforts and expand more rapidly in those areas and among those population groups, which are lagging behind and hard to reach; most importantly, comprehensive harm reduction programmes among injecting drug users, and safe sex among men having sex with men.

172,12,2013,Supreme Court verdict on IPC section 377 impedes fight against HIV/AIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Supreme-Court-verdict-on-IPC-section-377-impedes-fight-against-HIV/AIDS/articleshow/27236005.cms,"MUMBAI: In July 2001, four staffers from a non-governmental organization in Lucknow working to fight HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men (MSM) were arrested and charged with the stringent IPC Section 377 (unnatural offences) and for sale obscene material among other offences. They were jailed for 47 days, their HIV/AIDS- related material seized and the offices of their NGOs Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust sealed. Health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi endured similar harassment, noted Human Rights Watch in its publication ""Epidemic of Abuse-Police Harassment of HIV/AIDS outreach workers"". The document highlights a bitter reality of India’s battle against HIV/AIDS—fighting the disease becomes an uphill task when criminality is attached to vulnerable communities. Much of these challenges associated with fighting HIV/AIDS were overcome thanks to the Delhi High Court judgement decriminalising same-sex relations in 2009. But they have been resurrected with the Supreme Court’s judgement on Wednesday. Activists fear the judgment will pose a huge setback for HIV/AIDS. ""It will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days it was very hard to get MSMs to health units as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgement,"" says Dr. L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India. He pointed out that the apex court’s judgement was likely to give legal backing to the biases of healthcare professionals and could fuel their discriminatory attitudes. The issue is particularly pressing as MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. Roughly seven per cent of the estimated 25 lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalisation in healthcare was in fact the basis of the Public Interest Litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in the Delhi HC. The National AIDS Control Organization too had admitted in its affidavit that Section 377 acted as a ""serious impediment"" to successful public health interventions. ""Those in the high risk group are mostly reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,"" stated the NACO affidavit. It had pointed out that social stigma forced many MSMs to deny their behaviour, thereby marrying or having sex with female partners and subsequently putting them too at the risk of HIV/AIDS. Ashok Row Kavi of the Humsafar Trust too echoed these concerns. ""It will put us in grave trouble. But the NACO’s progressive schemes have helped the community and we will continue that work,"" he said. The negative impact * Gay persons would be afraid to approach healthcare systems as they could be reported under Section 377. * The judgment would make healthcare workers who work with LGBTQ (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender, queer) communities vulnerable to police harassment for ‘promoting’ illegality. * Social stigma could force MSMs to deny their sexual behaviour, marry women and have sex with female partners putting them at the risk of HIV/AIDS.

The community is of the opinion that after SC order there is an urgent need to amend Section 377 of IPC or it would have a negative impact on the campaign against HIV. Convener of Badlao Samiti, an organization working for gays in MP, Rajnish Lengar said, ""After the court decision, many people won't come out in open about their sexual orientation and this will hamper the ongoing drive against AIDS as homosexuals are considered to be a highly vulnerable group."" He said after the SC decision the community will be under threat. ""Gays who have already disclosed their identity will face immense problems,"" he said. There are about 50,000 gays in Madhya Pradesh and most have disclosed their sexual orientation. Another gay Rahul, 25, said gay consensual sex within four walls should not be a problem to anybody. ""Consensual sex should not be kept under the category of crime,"" he said. ""People have sex as per their natural orientation and it cannot be controlled by law,"" said Pramod. Making gay sex a criminal offence will make people shy away from discussing problems and create health-related issues for society as many gays are bi-sexual and married, he said. ""People are having unnatural sex from time immemorial and it will continue in the future too and it is impossible for any law to regulate it. Government should legalise it so that people can talk about it freely and be made aware about sexual diseases,"" said 26-year-old Amit."

District magistrate Sameer Verma as head of the district AIDS control cell was also present in the workshop attended by several doctors and AIDS counsellors. Chief Development Officer (CDO) Rajendra Singh Yadav, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr RP Yadav and District Tuberculosis Officer (DTO) Dr AK Saxena also attended the workshop coordinated by 'Pragati Seva Sansthan'. Main speaker Dr Preeti Pathak laid emphasis on creating HIV and AIDS awareness from home. She said that children would be under risk category till parents were ready to discuss AIDS with their children on dining table. ""The number of AIDS patients is multiplying every year. The country has a large number of persons afflicted with HIV/AIDS. The country manufactures most of the drugs used to cure HIV around the world yet due to high cost, 50% of patients in India lack access to them. Hence education and awareness can be the only remedy,"" added Preeti. Addressing the conference, DM, Sameer Verma said that as there is no proper medical treatment for this deadly disease, awareness is the only 'Mantra' and hence awareness should be reach to all horizons of the society. Sharing information about HIV and AIDS, District Tuberculosis Officer (DTO) Dr AK Saxena said that AIDS was the biggest challenge. Most of the patients belonged to the productive age group of 15 to 49 years. He added that the disease was spreading at an alarming pace in the country and as per the recent figures around 62 lakh patients were suffering from the disease and the number was continuously increasing. ""The effort will succeed only when all organizations participate in this endeavor. Awareness is the only precaution and the government must work to create awareness,"" said the CMO. CDO Rajendra Singh Yadav said that he would organize AIDS and HIV awareness workshop in villages and take the message to all sections of the society. AIDS counsellors Ritu Singh, Krati, Mahendra and Amit were also present during the workshop. "
175,12,2013,New treatment cuts several HIV positive cases among newborns,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/New-treatment-cuts-several-HIV-positive-cases-among-newborns/articleshow/27494365.cms,"TRICHY: The number of HIV positive babies born to AIDS-infected mothers has come down drastically thanks to the new type of treatment at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. In 2013, 38 babies born to HIV positive mothers tested negative in Trichy. Since the beginning of this year, 'Nevirapine' tablets were administered to HIV-positive mothers 76 hours before delivery while babies were administered Nevirapine syrup from the time of their birth at all ART centres. Though that type of treatment was useful to bring down the number of births of HIV-positive babies, the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) that decided to eradicate it completely, made a change in the treatment method. As per the new method, the Nevirapine tablets should be taken by HIV-positive mothers for 14 weeks during pregnancy and the babies should be given Nevirapine syrup for at least six months. Dr Manivannan, medical officer of the ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), Trichy said that the new regimen of treatment was proved to be effective to ensure the birth of HIV-negative babies born to HIV-positive mothers. ""We work towards achieving the target of nil birth of HIV-positive babies in 2015. We hope it will be possible to reach the target with the present mode of treatment to the HIV-positive mothers. With this method, we can bring down the rate of possibility of babies getting affected to one to two percent from the previous rate of 20 per cent,"" he said. In 2012, 45 babies were born to HIV-positive mothers. However, only one baby tested positive and the rest of them tested negative. It is unfortunate that in most of the cases the HIV-positive mothers are victims of marriage with HIV-positive men. At the time of marriage, women are not made aware whether their partners are HIV-positive. On the other hand, the men are also lethargic to go for HIV test before marriage. ""When it is found during pregnancy check-up that a woman is HIV-positive, it comes as a shock to them. But many of the uneducated people from rural areas are not bothered about it. At the same time, the educated people from urban areas completely collapse. So, we have to provide counselling to them to give morale booster,"" said Dr Manivannan who appealed to all the married women to undergo HIV test. The blood of the new born baby is tested through dry blood sample (DBC) method at the Tuberculosis Centre in Chennai. Normally, the presence of HIV virus can be confirmed only after 18 months of delivery. However, Dr Manivannan said that the results through DBC method would almost be the same as the results that come after 18 months."

Lack of awareness and social stigma pose the greatest obstacles in a vulnerable state like Assam. Prominent activist Jahnabi Goswami, the first woman from the northeast to declare herself HIV positive, rued that the social conditions are not conducive to fighting the disease. ""It is very unfortunate that we have failed to create mass awareness regarding HIV. If we continue to be secretive about the disease, we cannot stop it from spreading,"" Goswami, who realized that she was infected with HIV in 1996, told reporters during an interactive session at the Guwahati Press Club, on Saturday. Even professionals like doctors and health practitioners are not adequately aware, Goswami said, citing examples of how a Guwahati-based private hospital had refused to provide treatment to a 14-year-old boy and his mother because they were HIV positive. ""It's strange how professional people behave even now. If they continue to spread intolerance, how we can expect the lay man to know about the disease? Several people still shy away from disclosing that they are infected, fearing social stigma. HIV positive people like us have to be vocal if we want to stop this disease from spreading further,"" Jahnabi, who runs the Assam Network of Positive People (ANPP), an NGO to create awareness and to facilitate treatment of HIV positive people, said. She lauded the proactive role played by the churches in Mizoram in this regard. The scenario is not as encouraging in Assam, with religious and social institutions not showing much interest in spreading awareness about HIV. According to the Assam State AIDS Control Society, the tate currently has an estimated 12,804 HIV positive people, of which 396 are children Though there has been a countrywide decline of 50 per cent in the numbers, she said the infection of young people is a matter of concern. Jahnabi added that diagnostic or testing centres should target areas in the interior of the state so that the disease can be detected early as it is easier to treat. In the last stage, response to treatment becomes difficult. Goswami was born in 1976 and was brought up at Kampur village in Nagaon district. At the age of 18, she was married to a Guwahati-based businessman in 1994, without 'checking his antecedents.' In 1995, her husband passed away, leaving behind Jahnabi and their three-month-old daughter, Kastorika."
