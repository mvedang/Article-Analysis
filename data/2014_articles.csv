0,1,2014,Software to track HIV+ pregnant women,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/Software-to-track-HIV-pregnant-women/articleshow/28251069.cms,"BANGALORE: Taking healthcare a step forward, the Karnataka state aids prevention society (KSAPS) is all set to introduce a software to track HIV positive pregnant women; the purpose being to eliminate chances of an unborn child getting afflicted while in the womb. The software is currently under trial in Bellary, Kolar and Udupi districts, and will be put in place at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) in all 30 districts of the state. ""It's mandatory for all pregnant women to go to ICTCs and get themselves tested. If any would-be mother is diagnosed HIV positive, we'll start monitoring her from the 14{+t}{+h} week of gestation. Thereafter, she goes to the Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres and gets herself treated. The software will help us keep track of the mother and the child till the infant turns 18 months old,"" said Dr BV Karur, additional project director, KSAPS. The software developed by the National Informatics Centre is being evaluated for its promptness. ""Training is on at various districts, and healthcare officials are being briefed on how to use the software. The process is simple - when a pregnant woman comes for check-up, her contact details are noted down. If she is found to be HIV positive, the healthcare provider keeps communicating with her to make sure she comes for treatment regularly,"" said Dr Lalita Hande, who has worked towards developing the software. ENCOURAGING NUMBERS * The state has a 0.22% prevalence of HIV among pregnant women * Going by data collated in 2010-11, HIV prevalence among general population is 0.69%, a decline from 1.5% in 2003-04 "

He is also aware now that there are many myths and beliefs associated with it. He got this gyaan, thanks to his college which had organized the Red Ribbon Club during the last week of November. Mohammed told TOI: ""A person with HIV stays near my house. When my neighbours spoke ill of her, I was confused. I didn't know about the precautionary measures, the causes, the new medicines and that even though a mother is affected, the baby can be prevented from it. I am thankful to my college for educating us about this as part of the club activity.'' Policy makers have often recommended that schools can be the focal point for disseminating information and education on HIV/AIDS. This 'social vaccine' will help students understand the issue better, say education experts. Two other students Pooja M and Chaithra B K said: ""The club activities have helped us in gaining knowledge about it. When one comes to know about the good and bad effects in his early stage of life, he can have a better life.'' Another student Amaresh S Chikkanath said: ""This is a good initiative by the college. We have learnt that if detected in the early stage, we can check it. We need more such awareness programmes.'' A 3-day rally was organized as part of the awareness programme of the club activity. The rally started from the college premises and covered Nanjangud Road, Gowrishankara Road, JSS College for Women, Saraswathipuram, JSS Hospital Road and Agrahara Circle. Nearly 3km was covered each day. Students were given an essay to write on the Role of youth in preventing HIV/AIDS and symptoms of HIV/AIDS."
3,1,2014,New therapy for HIV patients soon,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/New-therapy-for-HIV-patients-soon/articleshow/28974107.cms,"NOIDA: In order to suppress HIV virus and stop progression of the disease, the district hospital will soon start 'Link-ART' facility to provide treatment to people visiting for tests and diagnostics. Every month around 500 people visit the hospital's Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC), which provides counselling and testing services, for check up and some of the patients are found HIV positive. ""In the month of November 2013, 490 people were tested and two were found HIV positive. In December, 7 persons were found HIV positive out of 559 people tested,"" said an official. Number of transgender visiting hospital for HIV test was reported 22 and 17 in November and December respectively. Dr Meena Mishra, chief medical superintendent, said that HIV tests are mandatory for surgical patients and also for pregnant women. ""The hospital has been providing free HIV tests and counselling to patients but it does provide the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) facility. Due to which the patients found HIV positive have been referred to either a medical college in Meerut or AIIMS, Delhi for medical dose."" She said that the Link-ART facility is likely to be available for patients by the next month. The people infected with HIV will be treated by using anti-HIV drugs which suppresses HIV replication and they would not need to go far. Dr Rashmi, clinical psychologist at the hospital, said that due to massive awareness, male and female both come to the hospital in large numbers. ""Most people hesitate to clearly explain their problems to us. We first help the people about understanding sexually transmitted diseases. Then advise them to go for test. This is a major infection and may lead to more complications if not cured on time,"" she said. According to officials, once the Link-ART facility is started at the hospital, the patients will be provided medical doze at their doorstep. The hospital, in association with Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi, has been already been providing PAP Smear test to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes of the female reproductive system."

She was left unattended on the floor of the medical registration department through the night even as she lay writhing in pain. The 35-year-old woman was a gang-rape survivor and had been taken to the hospital by her brother and sister. The intern who was on duty had asked her to return on Saturday morning, citing unavailability of senior doctors. Jolted by the incident, hospital authorities said on Saturday that action would be taken against the errant doctor and promised there would be no re-run of such incidents. ""No doctor was there to attend us when we came here last night. The intern was rude and asked us to come next day. I was not in a position to go back as it was very cold outside. We had to squat on the floor for several hours,"" she said. After the woman delivered early Saturday, hospital staff swiftly shifted her to the maternity ward. CIMS dean Dr S K Mohanty told TOI, ""We will definitely take action against the doctor. It's an unfortunate incident"". Hospital in charge Dr Lakhan Lal said, ""We have sent a report to the head of the department. It is a fact that CIMS is facing acute shortage of staff. The total staff strength at the hospital is just 46% of the sanctioned strength."" ""In any case, staff-on-duty should have admitted the patient on arrival. I don't know under what circumstances she was asked to come back in the morning,"" he said. CIMS doctors, however, refused to identify the intern, who was on night duty. The woman said she became pregnant after she was sexually assaulted by three people while she was living alone after separation from her husband and family last year. Later, all three accused were arrested and remanded to judicial custody after she lodged a police complaint. "

Referring to the recent death of an AIDS-infected couple at Dharmanagar in north Tripura, he said isolation of AIDS patients reflected erosion of family values. ""We are examining the model of Rajasthan and Delhi to deal with HIV/AIDS infected people, as social security and financial support will provide them with dignity,"" he said, confirming that Tripura had 11,055 HIV positive individuals, of whom 438 were AIDS patients. He also said 127 AIDS-related deaths have been recorded in the last 14 years. Chakraborty added that the risk of transmission had increased due to greater interstate worker movement. He urged all stakeholders to counter social stigma and discrimination against HIV/AIDS infected people."

A brand ambassador of the Manipur Aids Control Society (Macs), Pradip had revealed his status after winning senior Mr Manipur title in December, 2007. Besides winning Mr South Asia title in Mr South Asia Body Building Championship held in Ludhiana and a bronze in Mr World in Bangkok in 2012, Pradip also bagged silver and a bronze in different national championships and stood 8th in Mr World competition earlier.

""The secretary of state may by order provide that persons who apply for immigration permission must demonstrate that they are not carriers of any of the prescribed pathogens listed — Hepatitis B, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and such other pathogens…,"" says the clause. The move has led to an uproar in the National AIDS Trust (NAT), who have called on the lawmakers to reject the amendment. ""This amendment shows there remains a shameful lack of understanding about HIV among some of our elected representatives,"" said NAT chief executive Deborah Jack. Jack said UNAIDS has shown that entry restrictions on people living with HIV do not protect public health and are a wasteful diversion in the fight against HIV. ""And far from being drains on the public purse — as this amendment seems to suggest— people living with HIV contribute hugely to the UK’s society and economy."" he added. The chief executive said the UK has for 30 years resisted entry restrictions and to introduce them now would set the country squarely against the international trend to overturn such rules. ""This is HIV prejudice in its purest form. If these MPs are really interested in protecting public health through immigration policy, they would oppose the current department of health plans to limit migrant access to primary care services, which are vital for disease prevention and early treatment,"" he said.

She was in a bad shape and needed immediate medical attention. But everybody at the centre, from doctors to technicians to clerical staff and counsellors were missing in action. With the staff of Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) on strike, the 40-year-old didn't know where to go. It's a similar scene across ART Centres in the state for almost a week now. Sumati couldn't even sit properly as her CD4 count dipped to 150, against the normal 350. CD4 cells are white blood cells that fight infection; their count indicates the patient's immunity levels. Sumathi is among the thousands of patients left to their fate, as the 2,057-strong staff of KSPAS have decided to voice their woes by staying from work. In Bowring Hospital alone, 9,583 HIV-positive patients are registered for ART treatment, and 200 patients come visiting every day. Patiently waiting for doctors and medical staff at the hospital, Jyothi (name changed), 29, an MNC employee said: ""I didn't know about the protest and travelled 15 km from Sunkadakatte for a check up. The staff may have genuine grouse, but they shouldn't inconvenience patients.""Demands on the table The workers striking since January 31 have two primary demands: regularization of work and salary hike. ""Some of us get just Rs 4,000 a month, and have no benefits like PF and insurance. KSAPS should be merged with the health and family welfare department,"" said Asif Ali, a lab technician at Victoria Hospital ART Centre, and a member of KSAPS employees' union. Many protesting employees said they haven't got their January salary. Of the 72 sanctioned posts for doctors at KSAPS, half are vacant, said the union representatives. However, NGOs, a crucial player in the war against AIDS in the state, are divided in their opinion. Said Praja Rajakiya Vedike's Elavarthi Manohar, ""The government must protect workers' interest."" Samuel Jesudas, a volunteer with Accept, an NGO, however felt medical services are essential and the plight of the patients can't be ignored. Usha A, who works with KNP +, a network of HIV-positive people said, ""I am bringing in new cases every day to the ART Centre but returning without any progress."" ""Medical service is essential. The plight of HIV-positives can't be ignored,"" said Samuel Jesudas, volunteer with Accept, an NGO.Pay disparity The starting salary of a government doctor is Rs 60,000 a month. But because I am with KSAPS, I get just Rs 25,000; this is nothing but disparity. I see 200 HIV-positive patients every day. With such poor working condition is it possible to do justice to my work or to my patients? No new doctors have been recruited as most are unwilling to work with KSAPS. In Bowring Hospital itself, two post are vacant. Dr Nirmala C, medical officer, art centre, Bowring HospitalMust take medicines Two lakh people living with HIV have enrolled with ART Centres across Karnataka. Of them, a lakh take Antiretroviral Therapy treatment, a monthly administering of medicines. These are compulsory and life long drugs and have to be taken at a 12-hour gap. They can't be missed. Saroja Putran, Karnataka network of people living with HIV/AIDS (KNP +)Key point noted Their key demand, a hike in wage, has been assured by the health minister.

The authorities were quick to label him as another victim of the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment that ""made patients suicidal"". For his mother, though, he was a victim of the city's indifferent public health system. ""HIV/AIDS had killed my husband around 12 years ago. That was also the time when I and my son tested positive for the disease. But I never felt so defeated then as much as I feel today. I could not save my son,"" said the 37-year-old mother of two. She does not cry or show any emotions as she narrates her son's painful journey since he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in December 2012. The robust Revised National TB Control Programme was of no consequence to the lower-middle- class family that spent over Rs 4 lakh, collected by selling land and other assets, to fund his treatment in a private hospital. The teenager, by his mother's own admission, faltered on the tuberculosis treatment and developed resistance to the drugs. This January, when his condition deteriorated, the family admitted him to Sewri TB Hospital, where MDR-TB was diagnosed. ""He often complained about the medication and injections,"" said the mother. ""I had no idea about MDR-TB. Doctors don't tell you much. They should have told me the drugs can make one suicidal,"" the mother said. Early on Wednesday, the mother said, she gave him his medicines, and left the ward as hospital rules did not allow her to sleep in a male ward. He developed breathing problems around 2am and called his mother on her cell phone. She rushed to his ward immediately. ""The nurse saw me there and started screaming. She said if someone misbehaved with me in a male ward, the hospital will not be responsible. I was asked to leave immediately,"" she said, adding the scuffle happened in front of her son. In less than an hour, the teenager slit his wrist. For the next three hours, the mother waited for an ambulance to arrive so that her son could be rushed to the nearby KEM Hospital, Parel. They reached KEM Hospital only around 5.30am. ""For the next 12 hours, my son lay there waiting for a surgeon to arrive. Three doctors checked his wounds but no one actively treated him. By 6pm, his pulse became feeble. He was declared dead in the next two hours,"" said the mother. ""So did TB or HIV kill my son? My answer is no, the system did,"" she said. Medical superintendent of Sewri TB Hospital Dr Rajendra Nanavare said people who work in the hospital cannot be called apathetic. ""They work here at the risk of getting life-threatening infections. MDR-TB patients are suicidal because of medication. We keep a close vigil but one has to understand we also work under a lot of staff crunch,"" he said. Doctors at KEM Hospital's casualty said they must check their records before commenting on the case."

The order was handed down by a New Delhi consumer disputes redressal forum. The forum, under president C K Chaturvedi, came down hard on the laboratory for a wrong report and said it revealed a “shocking state of affairs in the laboratory”, adding that it was ""fleecing consumers by false advertisements and use of inefficient medical personnel and staff."" According to the complaint, on May 24, 2003, the doctor who was working with the Army Medical Corps as a paediatric specialist in a military hospital at Kirkee, Pune, had accidentally pricked her finger during a routine procedure on a baby born to an HIV positive mother. “The complainant as per duty code of the armed forces reported the matter to the duty medical officer. It is alleged that she was advised to get herself tested and treated, if required, for post-exposure prophylaxes. The nature of infection being life-threatening, several repeated tests at various intervals had to be done as a matter of procedure till final confirmation by way of a report on HIV detection. The complainant subjected herself to various tests from different laboratories to ascertain whether the HIV virus had passed into her at the time of the incident,"" said the order. The tests revealed there was no infection, but the doctor went for a final test to Dr Lal PathLabs in Delhi “because it possessed state-of-the-art equipment for various tests and was known for its expertise,"" read the order. On August 4, 2003, the complainant received a call from the Pune office of that laboratory which conveyed to her that the report was positive. This traumatized her and her family members and plunged them into gloom and fear. Next day, a second confirmation test was carried out. The doctor alleged that as a result of the initial report and confusion created by it, she got admitted and subjected herself to a series of tests and Army procedures. A court of inquiry way set up on August 6, 2003, and, consequently, the complainant was placed in a low medical category for prospective HIV infection on September 16, 2003. “This allegedly caused grave mental agony, loss of reputation and respect, and stigma and (she) had to undergo a rigorous process of observation and restriction for 12 weeks,” said the court order. The lab argued that test conducted on the complainant was not a diagnostic test. "

They demanded that the department of AIDS control (DAC) increase VLT availability. The test is crucial to detecting the onset of AIDS. Networks affiliated to People Living with HIV (PLHIV) like the Manipur-based Community Network for Empowerment (Cone), a state-level network of people who use drugs, and Medicine Sans Frontiers (MSF) stated that the Manipur State AIDS Clinical Expert Panel (SACEP) is not doing enough to ensure availability of VLT. It also accused SACEP of falling prey to bureaucratic red tape and putting the lives of HIV positive people at risk. ""In Assam and Sikkim, samples are sent directly to the referral laboratory in Kolkata. However, HIV positive people in Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh have to come to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal to give their blood samples. They have to wait a long time to get their results as well,"" said Leena Menghaney, campaign coordinator, MSF. According to recent guidelines of World Health Organization (WHO), HIV positive people who are on antiretroviral treatment(ART) need to get a VLT done annually to ensure correct treatment. Menghaney added that VLT accessibility in some African countries was better than in India. Citing an example of an HIV positive Manipuri girl who lost her life while waiting for a VLT, community members of PLHIV expressed that treatment monitoring was a necessity. ""HIV positive people in the region, whose first line of treatment had failed, could die waiting for access to VLT to confirm treatment failure. We want DAC to respond to the situation here and ensure that patients do not face unnecessary delays in their clinical assessment,"" said Rakjumar Nalinkanta, president, CONE. Till July 2013, Mizoram had 8,258 HIV positive people, with 2,556 patients on ART, 12 patients on second line treatment, and 14 people waiting for VLT. Two people died last year in December while waiting for VLT. In Manipur, there are more than 40,000 HIV positive people. VLT determines the success of ART. There are VLT machines in Manipur, Assam and Megahalya but they are not recognized by NACO. Viral Load Test measures the number of copies of HIV'S genetic material (RNA) in every millilitre of blood. A person's viral load is undetectable when there are less than 50 copies per millilitre of blood, implying that the virus has been suppressed. The test prevents patients from being given more expensive drugs by doctors. However, owing to its high price of VRL, a patient's CD4 white blood cells are still used to monitor a patient's response to treatment."

Apart from urging the government to pass the revised Manipur State AIDS Policy, 2010, in the ongoing assembly session, the memo sought to make all entitlement schemes and benefits available to PLHIVs. The memo urged the government to ensure that laboratory testing and investigations for HIV/AIDS patients be made free of cost in all government hospitals and Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres. This would include treatment for opportunistic infections and related illnesses like hepatitis C. The NGOs also demanded that basic amenities such as drinking water, sanitation and seating arrangements at all ART centres should be provided to PLHIVs. Manipur is one of India's six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states. According to the latest report prepared by Manipur State AIDS Control Society (Macs), the state has 43,707 PLHIVs. Of this number, 11,878 are women and 2,780 are children. As a result of the government's failure to implement such measures, PLHIVs face acute challenges in accessing basic healthcare, supportive medicine, food, education and housing. The memo highlighted the increasing poverty levels among Manipur's HIV positive community and stated that increasing prices was a major threat to the infected population as it decreased access to basic commodities. The NGOs demanded the appointment of adequate doctors in government hospitals to deal with HIV cases, especially gynecologists for female PLHIVs. Increasing accessibility of ART at treatment centres and installing and improving CD4 count and viral load testing machines at such centers were some of their other demands. The memo, a copy of which was forwarded to Manipur speaker Th Lokeshwar Singh, health minister Phungzathang Tonsing, social welfare minister A K Mirabai Devi and MLA I Ibohalbi Singh, stated that the NGOs had earlier put forward their demands to the government, but in vain."

""HIV cases should be screened for other viruses and a holistic treatment given to patients for a better quality life,"" he said while delivering the eighth Professor JV Bhat Memorial Oration at School of Life Sciences, Manipal University here on Monday. ""Since most of the HIV-related mortality is due to these liver infections, and not necessarily from that of HIV, the experts should pay attention to the viruses as there is sufficient evidence to show they exist. All viruses should be taken into consideration together and treated appropriately. Because if HIV is treated and contained, the hepatitis viruses' problem still remains,"" said Professor Thyagarajan and added by doing so, the mortality rate can be reduced. He spoke on the co-infection of HIV and the various forms of Hepatitis Virus (HBV, HCV etc.) in Indian population. A pioneer in this area of research, he gave an overview of the different facets of the HIV-HBV and HIV-HCV co-infections. Backed by scientific data, he showed that co-infection of HIV-HCV was much more prevalent in the population than that of HIV-HBV co-infection. He also pointed out that with advances in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) death due to HIV infections has been on the wane. However, most of the deaths that still occur are due to secondary or co-infections with liver diseases due to hepatitis virus co-infection being the most common cause. These can, with the help of available prognostic markers and treatment modalities, be altered with interactions between the clinicians and the diagnostic microbiologists. The Prof. JV Bhat Memorial Oration is an initiative of the School of Life Sciences and Manipal University. Earlier, Prof. PM Gopinath welcomed the gathering. Dr H. Vinod Bhat, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Manipal University in his presidential address recalled the humble beginnings of this oration lecture and marveled at the prestige and history that it has attained. He also highlighted the research and efforts of Prof. SP Thyagarajan in his pioneering research on HIV-Hepatitis co-infections, how he helped the community in treatment of such conditions and also his role in educating students at various levels.

During the current year, HIV testing was taken up at primary health centres and 4,111 tests were conducted. The state government provides financial assistance of 2,000 per month to eligible persons living with HIV (PLHIV) under the Dayanand Social Security Scheme and till date, 150 beneficiaries have been covered under the scheme. The government has also extended the benefit of 50% travel concession to PLHIVs residing in Goa to travel by KTCL buses and till date, 509 PLHIVs have availed of the facility. The ART centre at the Goa Medical College, Bambolim, provides treatment to PLHIVs and till date, 5,538 patients have been registered; of which, 2,817 patients started on ART and till date 1,928 patients are alive on ART. A care support centre (CSC) Vihaan has also been started at St Cruz to establish linkages of PLHIVs with various service providers and to assist the ART centre in tracking the missing/lost to follow-up patients, the economic survey said."

Often referred to as a viral time bomb, the disease is widespread among intravenous drug users (IDUs). Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the Hepatitis-C virus (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 per cent and 78 per cent respectively. In Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the Indian Council of Medical Research and others, was 20.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them. ""The main objective is to create awareness about viral Hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease,"" said Ketho, general secretary of Hepatitis Coalition of Nagaland (HEPCON). With much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 per cent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to Hepatitis-B patients (HBV). ""Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs,"" said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Another factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 per cent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water."

Every year, some two lakh sugarcane cutters migrate to Kolhapur district alone on the job and are found to be vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. ""Sugarcane cutters move from field to field over November to April every year. Once they return to their homes in Latur, Osmanabad, Ahmednagar and Beed districts, they should not miss their medication. We are working on a detailed plan to write to the primary health centres, informing them about the disease, the patients and their treatment,"" Suryavanshi said. The follow-up will help in controlling the disease and check its spread among other people, he said. Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) are working on this pilot project, where all sugarcane cutters are approached for medical examination and counselling. The medication and counselling is free. ""Sugarcane cutters are paid at one time; generally before the beginning of the cutting season. They carry cash with them and use it to pay sex workers. Often, sexual intercourse is unprotected; hence they are prone to HIV infection. Some of these workers are also engage in casual sex with female co-workers in their groups or a group travelling together from one field to another. In interior rural areas, no contraceptives are available. In such situations, the possibility of transmission of infection increases,"" said MSACS regional programme officer Jagdish Patil. Many sugarcane cutters have also been detected for HIV-tuberculosis co-infection, he said. Asked about the CEO's proposal, Patil said, ""If it works, it will be a major achievement in this field because the migrants are major carriers of HIV infection in all sectors and it is tough to maintain a follow-up on them. The government is spending a huge amount on controlling HIV infection and we need to support it with continuous follow-ups."""
18,3,2014,HIV patients stage protest against drug scarcity,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/HIV-patients-stage-protest-against-drug-scarcity/articleshow/31931480.cms,"MUMBAI: HIV/AIDS patients are going to protest against the scarce supply of drugs that requires them to frequent the treatment centres way too often. The protest is going to be staged outside the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) office in Wadala on Thursday. Patients are livid that they are given only a week's supply of the antiretroviral therapy medicines when the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) allows the patients to take home a month's quota. MSACS is responsible for giving free HIV drugs medicines to to all patients across the state, but has done little to tackle the severe shortage of HIV medicines. ""Patients from as far as Nagpur and Sindhudurg and several other parts of the state have to travel every week to Mumbai to get these medicines. They cannot do this forever managing their jobs and concealed HIV status at workplaces or risk losing their jobs and dignities, because of the stigma attached to the illness,"" said one of the patients.

19,3,2014,Can’t come to JJ every week for free drugs: HIV+ patients,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Cant-come-to-JJ-every-week-for-free-drugs-HIV-patients/articleshow/31976379.cms,"MUMBAI: Upset HIV-infected patients of the Mumbai Aids Forum staged a protest outside the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society’s Wadala office on Thursday demanding a more regular supply of the free antiretroviral drugs at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre in JJ Hospital. An erratic drug supply of second-line medication has forced thousands of patients—some from as far as Nagpur, Sindhudurg, Akola and even parts of Gujarat—to frequent the treatment centre multiple times a week to collect the drugs instead of the usual once-a-month practice. “Most HIV-positive people hide their status at their workplace. We cannot afford to seek leave every alternate day to collect the medicines. Several people have lost their jobs because of this,” said an HIV patient, adding that lately he has been asking for leave once every week. The Bhayander resident said he has already switched jobs twice as too many questions about his absenteeism were raised at the workplace. Another HIV-positive patient, a 37-year-old Sion resident, said he has been missing doses as his boss has started questioning his medical fitness. “How many leaves can an office grant in a week? We cannot even buy the drugs from outside given the steep cost,” he complained. Patients are livid that while other four ART centres—in Nagpur, Aurangabad, Pune and Sangli—have dealt with the medicine shortage by procuring them locally, the same zeal was lacking at JJ, which has been accused of inadequate supply of drugs for the last six months. The only centre to disburse second-line medicines in city, it also caters to patients from Konkan region. An official from the state Aids control society said the hospital has recently purchased second-line medicines worth Rs16 lakh, but the patients rejected the claim. Nearly 2,400 patients are on second-line HIV treatment in the state, of which about 900 come to JJ Hospital. “We wrote to the Mumbai District Aids Control Society asking for three months’ supply of drugs, but did not get any response,” said Dr VK Joglekar in-charge of the ART centre, JJ Hospital. “The problem will be resolved within a month. We have placed the orders. Tenders were floated earlier but there were no bidders,” said Dr BB Rewari, head of ART at National Aids Control Organisation. A member of CHIRAG, an action group of HIV+ people, alleged that at least two HIV-infected patients died last year due to the delay in moving them from first- to second- line of treatment. One was a 37-year-old woman who was admitted to JJ for three months, only to be told that her viral load was too high for the second-line medication to work. “She died within days,” said a worker from the group.

20,3,2014,Mystery shrouds boy's HIV infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/Mystery-shrouds-boys-HIV-infection/articleshow/32041099.cms,"CHENNAI: KG Hospitals on Friday afternoon admitted that there was ""some confusion"" about how the 16-year-old boy from Ooty could test positive for HIV. They admitted that the boy had tested negative for the virus before his dialysis treatment in December, but tested positive for it in March. The hospital claims they have clear records of the three people, whose blood was transfused into the boy, and tests to show that they were HIV negative. ""We do not know how the virus entered the boy's blood stream,"" admitted the hospital's chairman K G Bhakthavatchalam. ""December could have been a window period for the virus, so it did not show in the blood tests done in December,"" he added. Insisting that his hospital was not responsible for transfusing HIV positive blood into the boy, he claimed that it could've happened ""during any usual treatment administered during the boy's childhood"". The boy had been treated by the hospital for more than three months for kidney failure. Both his kidneys had failed; he was undergoing dialysis and needed a transplant urgently. Doctors admit that the ""window period theory"" could have happened, but say a detailed viral load test is required to confirm the virus and monitor the infection. Doctors say if the boy is infected with HIV type 1, there are incidents of the virus strain not showing up in blood tests for months or even years after it enters a person's blood stream. ""It may have entered due to a mistake that happened much earlier,"" said a doctor. ""The viral load test will also give us an idea of the danger it poses immediately, how it should be treated and how long the virus may have been present in the boy,"" says Dr Soundaravel, assistant resident medical officer of Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) indicating that it could hold clues to the above controversy. The viral load test would also indicate whether he needs antiretroviral therapy. ""His CD 4 cell count should be checked regularly to monitor his body's immune system, especially since he is undergoing dialysis treatment and will be on immunosuppressant drugs,"" he added. ""He will have to undergo dialysis for the rest of his life, and if his CD4 count falls he should be very careful with infections,"" he further added. Doctors also admitted there were possibilities of the hospital not following protocols laid down by the National Blood Transfusion Council. ""We are made to take a detailed case history on every pint of blood we collect and store. We have records of illnesses, diseases and alcohol history of the donor and strains of it present in the blood. We also test each of them for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and malarial bacteria before making it ready for issue,"" said Dr Shyam of Ganga Hospitals, which with 150 to 200 units of blood has one of the largest blood banks in the city. ""Even after it is issued our systems ensure we can trace the donor and blood's history within minutes,"" he added."
21,3,2014,Rare woman-to-woman HIV case,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/Rare-woman-to-woman-HIV-case/articleshow/32044286.cms,"WASHINGTON: A 46-year-old woman in the US has likely acquired HIV from her female partner in a rare case of female-to-female sexual transmission of the deadly AIDS virus, scientists say. The woman “likely” acquired the virus during a six-month monogamous relationship with a 43-yearold HIV-positive woman in Texas, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. In August 2012, the Houston department of health contacted CDC regarding the rare transmission of HIV likely by sexual contact between two women. Laboratory testing confirmed that the woman with newly diagnosed HIV infection had avirus virtually identical to that of her female partner, who was diagnosed previously with HIV and who had stopped receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2010. The woman with newly acquired infection did not report any other recognized risk factors for HIV infection, and the viruses infecting the two women had 98% sequence identity in three genes. Transmission of HIV between women who have sex with women (WSW) has been reported rarely and is difficult to ascertain. The potential for HIV transmission by female-to-female sexual contact includes unprotected exposure to vaginal or other body fluids and to blood from menstruation , or to exposure to blood from trauma during rough sex. Other potential exposures associated with HIV transmission in WSW that must be ruled out include injection drug use (IDU), heterosexual sex, tattooing, acupuncture , piercing, use of shared sex toys between the partners and other persons, exposure to body fluids of others, and receipt of transplants or transfusion, the report said. The woman who acquired HIV had a history of heterosexual intercourse, but not in the 10 years before HIV infection. She reported three female sexual partners in the preceding 5 years but said she had no IDU, receipt of tattoos, acupuncture, transfusions, transplants, or any other recognised HIV risk behaviour . The woman supplemented her income by selling her plasma and had tested negative for HIV by HIV-1 /2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) serology screening after donating plasma in March 2012. In April, 10 days after donating plasma, the woman went to an emergency department with a sore throat, fever, vomiting, decreased appetite, pain on swallowing , dry cough, frequent diarrhoea, and muscle cramps. At that time, she was again tested for HIV by EIA serology screening , and the results were negative. She was treated with azithromycin for a presumed upper respiratory infection and discharged. Eighteen days later, the woman attempted to sell plasma but was refused because she tested positive for HIV by EIA serology screening followed by an HIV-1 Western blot test. "
22,3,2014,Most hospitals refuse to treat HIV patients,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/Most-hospitals-refuse-to-treat-HIV-patients/articleshow/32099402.cms," COIMBATORE: A day after a private hospital in Race Course in the city refused to treat a 16-year-old boy further because he was HIV positive, NGOs working with HIV positive patients said almost 98% of private institutions in the city reject patients if they are HIV infected. Kamakshi (name changed), 43, a house-wife who was HIV positive had to undergo a simple colonoscopy because her physician advised her to do so after she complained of chronic stomach pain. She approached a mid-level hospital in Sundarapuram and got her admission form done. However, when she told the staff that she was HIV positive, they returned her admission and claimed they had too many patients lined up for colonoscopy for the next two days and didn't have a vacant bed even in the general ward. ""They asked me to a call three days later or better approach a government hospital for the test,"" she said. The Coimbatore Positive Network, a city-based NGO, said the polite rejection that Kamakshi received was better than usual. ""Almost all private hospitals in the city and surrounding districts refuse to treat or operate on HIV patients,"" said the network's president M Somesh. ""They tell patients that they don't have facilities or infrastructure to treat HIV positive people,"" he said. They tell them to go to government hospitals in Coimbatore or Pollachi, he added. A campaign by the network sensitization programmes held by Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS), three large hospitals have agreed to treat and operate HIV patients. ""We have got them to conduct around 15 deliveries so far,"" says Somesh. However, these hospitals charge HIV patients twice the amount they take from regular patients. ""They claim they have to purchase disposable instruments and gear such as gloves, masks, costumes which they have to dispose after one use and hence the higher charge,"" said Somesh. But we are glad that they at least treat us, so we have learned to bear the costs, he said. Though Coimbatore district has more than 10,300 registered HIV positive patients, the two government hospitals and one link centre are the only venues where a patient can get Anti retroviral therapy (ART) at subsidised rate. ""Even if other private hospitals offer ART, they do not tell us. In fact, hospitals that treat HIV positive patients do not want it to be known,"" said Somesh. Hospitals said they can't be blamed, because ART medication is expensive and the general public is scared of being treated along-side HIV positive patients. ""We have a separate wing to treat HIV patients, conduct surgeries and even do deliveries. We do not publicise it much because we do not want our general patients to live in fear of a transfusion mistake or infection,"" said a doctor at one of the hospitals that treat HIV patients. ""We do not want doctors to lose out on their normal patients,"" he added. Surprisingly, not a single complaint has been filed against any hospital for rejecting a HIV positive patient. ""We have not got any such complaints against a hospital so far,"" said Dr A S Valan, regional coordinator, TANSACS. ""When we get such a complaint we will refer it to the Indian Medical Association and sensitise the particular hospital,"" he says. The law clearly mentions that HIV patients can't be discriminated against. IMA officials said many hospitals refuse HIV patients not because they intend to discriminate but simply because ""they lack the expertise to treat them"". ""Treatment of HIV patients is becoming a specialty on its own. For example, you need to understand the stage of the virus and there are drugs which can't be prescribed along with ART drugs,"" said IMA state president Dr M Balasubramanian. This is a far cry from Chennai where almost all big hospitals have started treating HIV patients. ""We haven't got any complaints from our members about being turned away from a hospital, despite them being very poor,"" says S Noori, president, South India Positive Network."
23,3,2014,New untouchables: People with HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/New-untouchables-People-with-HIV/articleshow/32378697.cms,"In the run-up to the colourful slugfest called electioneering, a motley group of people cried out in the wilderness of our mushrooming urban jungle. Not just ill-informed and superstitious Khap Panchayats but even our educated and intelligent health service providers have apparently added a fifth 'varna' to our patriarchal, parochial, and stratified society. At the very bottom of the heap are the new untouchables - those who are denied c-sections, gallbladder and other surgical interventions, those who can't get broken bones mended - children, women, and men testing positive for HIV. The first-ever survey conducted by HIV positive people (also called PLHA) on HIV positive people in Patna came to light recently. So much is the fear of being ostracized that 50% of those surveyed haven't disclosed their status to their family while 77% haven't disclosed their status to close friends. While 5% lost their share of property, 2% of the women were thrown out of their homes. As many as 34% of those employed face problems at the workplace after their HIV status became known. However, the majority of the survey sample consisted of those in the informal sector. The Community Health Medicinal Unit (CHMU) presented their findings on issues and problems of people with HIV and AIDS in a consultation attended by prominent members of the HIV/AIDS fraternity, including representatives from state government bodies, NGOs, doctors, lawyers and so on. The report reflected the growing anxiety of PLHA and their families about the denial of surgical procedures and treatment by government doctors, some incidents of which have been highlighted in the local media. By and large, BSACS (Bihar State AIDS Control Society) and the state government have ensured regular and timely dispensing of ART (antiretroviral therapy) medicines that PLHA need with 94% of the survey respondents giving positive responses about the facilities available in Patna (PMCH and RMRI). But no PLHA gets treatment for opportunistic infections from the PHCs (primary health centres). Greater coordination is needed between BSACS, government and civil society to address issues that go beyond the mere distribution of free medicines. ""Doctors belong to the educated and enlightened section of our society, but there are among them (those) who practice untouchability vis-à-vis persons with HIV,"" said the report. The doctors attending the event claimed there were orthopaedic surgeons and gynaecologists in the city who have never refused to operate on patients with HIV, but these can be counted on the finger of one hand, says Chandy Joseph of CHMU. The conference recognized that surgeons fear contracting HIV by coming into contact with infected body fluids during operative procedures, and government hospitals are not provided good quality protective gear. It strongly recommended that the government supply adequate protective kits to surgical departments to deal with this issue. Doctors Diwakar Tejaswi and A K Singh said the government should turn its attention to upgrading four key factors that impact PLHA and are linked to prejudice against them. These factors include doctors and training programmes, availability of post-prick prophylaxis, availability of protection kits and care and nursing services training for serving PLHA. The doctors recommended that the government should conduct trainings and orientations for medical service providers and paramedics on how to provide services to PLHA, and enlist as resource persons surgeons such as Dr John Mukhopadhyay, Dr Manoj Kumar and others who regularly perform surgical interventions for PLHA so that there could be a sharing of ideas that will lead to a reduction in stigma and discrimination. The conference also recommended that PLHA should be entitled to BPL status and accorded the entitlements by virtue of their condition in the spirit of the Supreme Court judgments. This status could be provided on the basis of the ART card. Special efforts should be made to ensure that the Right to Education Act norms of elementary education effectively covers children with HIV. The positive attitude of the representatives of the PLHA attending the conference was remarkable. ""Yes, many of us face discrimination, even abuse, but we are not here to point fingers. Let's educate each other, understand our fears, and engage with civil society and government more actively,"" said Sanjeet Singh, the person who has successfully used the PIL route to bring relief to affected members of the PLHA community."
24,3,2014,HIV positive and happily married,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/HIV-positive-and-happily-married/articleshow/32380521.cms," PANAJI: Catherine and Desmond Fernandes from South Goa have been happily married for four years now and have a three-year-old daughter. They appear like any other couple, yet theirs is no ordinary coupling. Having tested positive for HIV-contracted from different partners-some years ago, the 43-year-old Desmond and 38-year-old Catherine did not let AIDS tie their lives in knots. Instead, they tied the knot, and thanks to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) their child is HIV negative. For Melvin and Janet D'Souza, both also HIV positive, the tying of the knot happened 30 years ago. They chose not to have children. NGOs working towards enlightening society on the humane treatment of those with HIV say more and more people with AIDS in Goa are taking the plunge into marriage. ""Loneliness and lack of companionship often lead to neglect of one's health, so having a partner does create an environment for a better future and longer life,"" says Maria Cardoso, project officer at Udant. Anita Pereira, also with the NGO, says, ""Many who have HIV initially have doubts about getting married, but, HIV does not prevent anyone from marrying, it only requires a little more responsibility and trust from both people in the relationship."" Medications, new infections, family issues and failing health burden HIV-positive couples everyday. Yet they stand by each other, fighting tough. Catherine, who contributes to the family income by selling vegetables she grows, says the couple has ""abundant worries"". ""We have short lives. And we have to think about the future of our child."" Janet, who works at the insurance firm where Melvin worked, says, ""Most of the challenges we face are perceived, not real. We make choices based on these perceptions."" Two of the choices for the D'Souzas have been not to have children-""we didn't want to leave them orphaned""-and not to buy a house-""so the surviving partner would not be saddled with a mortgage"". ""I never thought long-term about changing my career. I am just happy we can support ourselves,"" says Janet. Pereira says many people with HIV nurse dreams of marriage and living normal lives, but since they are unable to meet like-minded people, their dreams remain unfulfilled. ""Moreover, having a sexual relationship with your partner can cause tremendous anxiety if you are HIV positive."" She points out the contrast that people with other diseases and disabilities lead normal, healthy lives that include relationships and marriage. Ask Janet what advice she has for those with HIV getting into relationships, and pat comes the reply, ""I don't think my advice would be different for 'positive' or 'negative'."" ""Honesty,"" she says, ""Is the most important thing you can bring to the table. And tolerance. And letting people grow at their own pace."" There's also learning how to argue. ""If you're agitated, walk away, and don't come back to the subject until you've calmed down and can hear each other's point of view,"" says Janet. Melvin says it's important for couples to support each other in doing things they're passionate about. Also, ""toss aside the petty stuff and concentrate on what's important. When you are given a life sentence, you make sure every day counts"". Dipak Kabadi, director of the government-run Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) says, ""There are half-a-dozen NGOs working to create awareness about HIV, and helping people living with the disease not to be stigmatized."" Cardoso sums up the message when she says, ""Supporting persons living with HIV to get married and have a family is an encouragement to help them lead a normal life.""

Around 50 children participated in the drive along with their parents and caretakers. Kimaya Shah, managing trustee of the foundation, said, ""The daylong drive was mainly to keep a track of our patients, beneficiaries and boost their confidence by treating them like normal people. A small scale baby-wellness competition was part of the drive. Another message we wanted to spread among the parents and caretakers was though some of children are HIV+, they can live a normal life. Unlike other diseases, the fear of death among AIDS patients is high. Another fear prevalent among the patients is that they could easily succumb to other infections."" She said though the foundation did not wish to compromise on the secrecy of the patients, it also wanted to boost their confidence. The organizers had divided the participating children into three age groups - six to 18 months, 18 to 36 months and 36 to 60 months. Their medical tests along with weight and height was checked. An awareness lecture on healthy diet, medication and its gradual results was also organized during the drive. Deepa Shipurkar, district AIDS prevention and control unit programme officer, said, ""The participating women and children are mainly from 3-4 tehsils in Kolhapur district, where the prevalence of such patients is higher. A lot of industrial activities take place in these tehsils, which have significant floating population."""

State government-run JJ Hospital in Byculla will be one of the 10 centres across the country where these specialized drugs will be distributed free of cost. “The decision has already been taken, but the drug-procuring process will take time,” said Dr B B Rewari, Naco’s national programme officer (ART). But the rollout should take place within six months, added Dr Rewari, who was in the city to attend the ongoing HIV Congress. India rolled out free ART in 2008, with 7.5 lakh people availing of it in 2014. Of these, around 7,500 HIV-positive people were moved to the second-line regimen after developing resistance. “Of these, 250 people are showing resistance to the second-line drugs as well,” said Dr Rewari. However, the government plans to prepare dosages of the third-line regimen for up to 1,000 patients. "

Shockingly, the hospital that treats over 850 patients at any given point of time does not have a single full-time counsellor. On Monday, an HIV-positive woman, who was admitted to the hospital, about 10 days ago for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR) treatment allegedly jumped off the lift duct on the first floor of the hospital. Her brother and his wife had paid her a visit just a few hours before she allegedly committed suicide. The autopsy report showed that she died of head injury. On February, it was a 19-year-old boy from Bandra who slashed his wrist after he could no longer bear to go through the long-drawn treatment regime. ""MDRTB treatment lasts for up to two years during which the patient can suffer from adverse effects ranging from nausea, deafness, blindness, among other things. The patient needs to be constantly motivated to take the medicines,"" a senior public health official said. Currently, there is only one counsellor from Medicine Sans Frontiers visiting the Sewri hospital. tnn ""Counselling should be made mandatory for resistant TB cases. They suffer from extreme mood swings. Most of them endure enormous financial and personal hardships that inadvertently affect their treatment,"" said a senior doctor from the TB hospital. The TB Hospital is already reeling under vacancies. For instance, only eleven assistant medical officer posts out of 27 are filled up. The hospital is running without two of its deputy medical superintendents. A BMC official, however, said that the situation will soon change. ""Sewri TB Hospital will get four counsellors for its DOTS plus centres and so will KEM, Nair and Sion hospitals. The posts have already been sanctioned from the centre under the Revised National Tuberculosis Programme (RNTCP),"" the official said."

Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and the Oak Crest Institute of Science in Pasadena, California, set out to study the relationship between the skin cells and the ""good"" bacteria. The health of the human vagina depends on a symbiotic/mutually beneficial relationship with ""good"" bacteria that live on its surface feeding on products produced by vaginal skin cells. These good bacteria, in turn, create a physical and chemical barrier to bad bacteria and viruses including HIV. The researchers are the first to grow human vaginal skin cells in a dish in a manner that creates surfaces that support colonisation by the complex good and bad communities of bacteria collected from women during routine gynecological exams. The bacteria communities have never before been successfully grown outside a human. By using this model of the human vagina, researchers discovered that certain bacterial communities alter the way HIV infects and replicates. Their laboratory model will allow careful and controlled evaluation of the complex community of bacteria to ultimately identify those species that weaken the defenses against HIV. The research group led by Richard Pyles at UTMB also indicated that this model ""will provide the opportunity to study the way that these mixed species bacterial communities change the activity of vaginal applicants including over-the-counter products like douches and prescription medications and contraceptives."" The team documented the potential for their system to better evaluate current and future antimicrobial drugs in terms of how they interact with ""good and bad"" bacteria. In their current studies a bacterial community associated with a symptomatic condition called bacterial vaginosis substantially reduced the antiviral activity of one of the leading anti-HIV medicines. Conversely, vaginal surfaces occupied by healthy bacteria and treated with the antiviral produced significantly less HIV than those vaginal surfaces without bacteria treated with the same antiviral. The study was published in the journal PLOS One. "

The new law that came into force on Sunday makes it legal for Britons to test and diagnose themselves at home. The move is expected to help 25,000 undiagnosed HIV-positive people know their status. There is, however, one small glitch - no OTC HIV testing kit is sold in the UK at present. Experts expect the kits to be available in the market by 2015. The US FDA approved the first OTC HIV test kit that allows people to test at home in 2012. The OraQuick In-Home HIV test is designed to allows individuals to collect an oral fluid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums inside of their mouths, then place that sample into a developer vial and obtain test results within 20-40 minutes. One in four people living with HIV in England is currently unaware of his or her infection in England, contributing to ongoing transmission in the population and poorer health outcomes for those individuals. Anthony Nardone, consultant epidemiologist in Public Health England (PHE's) HIV/STI department, said: ""People who are unaware of their infection are likely to be those most at risk of transmitting HIV to others. By encouraging earlier and more frequent HIV testing, we can accelerate a reduction in the number of people with undiagnosed HIV infection in the UK. We hope this new resource will help people decide to test for HIV in the way that best suits them."" In August 2013, the department of health had announced plans to repeal the UK ban on the sale of HIV self-testing kits "

The court rejected the man's plea for leniency on health grounds saying such crimes need to be curbed.

The ruling from a single judge bench of Justice Madan Tahaliyani came on criminal appeal of Buldhana-based Raju Girnare, currently lodged in Amravati Central Jail. He was accused of kidnapping, outraging the modesty of and raping a 14-year-old girl on May 17, 2009, in Buldhana after luring her with promise of marriage. After a complaint by her father, the police arrested and charge-sheeted him under Sections 363, 366 and 376 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The ad hoc additional sessions judge in Buldhana convicted and sentenced Girnare to seven years' rigorous imprisonment for rape and five years for kidnapping on February 23, 2012. The petitioner approached the high court appealing for lesser punishment under proviso to Section 376(1) of IPC contending he was a HIV positive patient and had two growing children, including a 13-year-old girl, to look after. The court, however, noted that his children were already being looked after by other family members as he was in custody from the date of arrest. Therefore, there is no occasion for the children to suffer. ""As far as the disease of the appellant is concerned, it is most probably invited by himself for which no leniency can be shown. HIV can be treated by regular visits to the hospital or consultation with the medical officer of the prison. Such facilities are provided in the prison where authorities are always mindful of the problems of the prisoners, particularly those who are suffering from severe diseases,"" Justice Tahaliyani observed while upholding Buldhana court's verdict. It was the case of survivor's father that he came in contact with Girnare during delivery of his wife at Buldhana Government Hospital. His daughter was staying with the mother in the ward. He came into contact with the petitioner as latter was also staying in the same hospital to look after one of his relatives was admitted there. On the fateful day, the girl, her father and petitioner had gone to vegetable market together in morning. In the evening, the girl went missing from the hospital along with the petitioner.

She always keeps the mobile phone with her, having balance of merely Rs 3-4, to contact her husband, a factory worker who too is HIV positive, in case of an emergency. She is distressed with the discrimination and stigma attached to HIV patients. She said it was more agonizing when her three-and-a-half-year-old healthy son is shooed away by the neighbours. ""We are treated as untouchables. Our family throws food in front of me like it is given to dogs. Doctors don't want to operate me because I am HIV positive. We have consulted many eye surgeons but no one is ready to operate me. One of the famous eye surgeons in Chandigarh examined my eyes with ear buds and didn't even touch me,"" she told TOI on Tuesday. The only person in the couple's lives that shows them some ray of hope is Dr Vaneet Sareen who has not only financially helped the hapless couple but has also assured to spend up to Rs 1 lakh on treatment of her eyes through his organization Akhil Bhartiya Human Rights Welfare Association. ""It's unfortunate but true that most of the doctors have denied her treatment on one pretext or the other,"" said Sareen. Gurinder acquired the virus from her drug addict husband who shared the syringes with other addicts for injecting narcotics. She said, ""I don't know how long would I survive with HIV, but I want my eyesight back so that I can work and contribute financially to run my family."" Groping her way to an almirah, Gurinder took out her old photographs and said, ""See how I looked then and what I have become now."" Her eye treatment would cost around Rs 12 lakh, says her husband, adding: ""How can we afford it? Moreover, doctors are simply not ready to operate an HIV positive patient. Every doctor refers her to the other."". Meanwhile, Dr Jyoti of Guru Nanak Dev Hospital said, ""She was undergoing antiretroviral therapy and had reaction from one of the drugs. But then we are giving same drugs to all HIV positive patients, hers is one out of a thousand case."" The doctor also denied that HIV patients were not operated due to stigma or fear. ""Specialized doctors are operating the HIV positive patients like others. Sometimes the patient thinks that he or she is being discriminated against.""

38,4,2014,HIV slowly adapting to humans: Scientists,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/HIV-slowly-adapting-to-humans-Scientists/articleshow/34289520.cms,"TORONTO: Scientists studying the evolution of HIV in North America have found evidence that the virus is slowly adapting over time to its human hosts. However, this change is so gradual that it is unlikely to have an impact on vaccine design, researchers said. ""Much research has focused on how HIV adapts to antiviral drugs — we wanted to investigate how HIV adapts to us, its human hosts, over time,"" said lead author Zabrina Brumme, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University. ""HIV adapts to the immune response in reproducible ways. In theory, this could be bad news for host immunity — and vaccines — if such mutations were to spread in the population,"" said Brumme. ""Just like transmitted drug resistance can compromise treatment success, transmitted immune escape mutations could erode our ability to naturally fight HIV,"" said Brumme. Researchers characterised the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequences from patients dating from 1979, the beginning of the North American HIV epidemic, to the modern day. The team reconstructed the epidemic's ancestral HIV sequence and from there, assessed the spread of immune escape mutations in the population. ""Overall, our results show that the virus is adapting very slowly in North America. In parts of the world harder hit by HIV though, rates of adaptation could be higher,"" said Brumme. ""We already have the tools to curb HIV in the form of treatment — and we continue to advance towards a vaccine and a cure. Together, we can stop HIV/AIDS before the virus subverts host immunity through population-level adaptation,"" Brumme added. The study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics. "

The representatives made the observations on Monday at a two-day meeting here which was attended by members of the department of AIDS control and regional participants working with IDUs. The discussion focussed on strengthening support systems, capacity building, resource sharing and better coordination among regional networks to make harm-reduction services more feasible. ""We are concentrating only on IDUs. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss strategies for strengthening networks and establishing linkages. There is a need to discuss critical areas of diagnostic studies and we need to be engaged with the state AIDS control societies,"" said IHRN's Rajkumar Raju. Despite substantial work in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention in the last two decades, there was still a high probability of new and potential IDUs getting infected with HIV or Hepatitis C in the northeast, said Raju. IDUs are considered a high-risk group, along with commercial sex workers, as far as chances of contracting HIV and other blood-borne diseases were concerned. Harm-reduction services provide substitution programmes for intravenous drug users and provide them with clean syringes ""The infection spreads quickly and most infected persons have no idea that they are afflicted. It is important that we devise ways to strengthen IDU networks in the northeast,"" said Raju. The need for Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) and better OST-related services will also form part of the discussions on Tuesday. ""There should be an effort to make local groups stronger so that information about new populations of intravenous drug users is recorded. Harm-reduction programmes were started to battle HIV,"" said Aditya Singh, department of AIDS control."

But doctors themselves have to be more cautious about contracting contagious diseases from patients they treat. Of late, both doctors and nurses in Trichy hospitals are alert to HIV risks from patients undergoing surgery. There have been cases where HIV-positive women who were admitted for delivery or caesarean didn't disclose their health condition fearing discrimination. To be on the safer side, doctors are now insisting on HIV tests for all surgery cases. Sources said two HIV-positive pregnant women got admitted at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) for emergency delivery in October and December last year. Only after completing the surgery, doctors came to know that they were HIV-infected. ""A nurse fainted after knowing that the blood scattered on her during the delivery was of an HIV-infected woman. She later took treatment to avoid the infection. Such incidences have occurred occasionally,"" said a hospital source. R Selvakumar, district supervisor, District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), said the HIV tests are being compulsorily done after such incidents. ""Following such incidents, HIV test was made mandatory. But we have heard that some private hospitals don't conduct the HIV test though it is a simple procedure. Doctors should take precautionary measures and HIV patients should not hide their health condition. Moreover, HIV-infected people should screen themselves at anti-retroviral therapy centres,"" said Selvakumar. Some private doctors here said patients hide information about certain health issues fearing adverse response. Dr S Nagamani, an obstetrics and gynaecologist here, said most private hospitals are strictly following all procedures before carrying out any surgery on pregnant women. ""Patients may not disclose condition fearing discrimination. But we take universal precaution to avoid any infection from any patient. The risk of infection is higher from Hepatitis B-affected patients than HIV-infected ones. Still, we do the HIV test before carrying out any treatment and safely handle the waste blood,"" said Dr Nagamani. Some doctors say that they can only advise the patients to undergo HIV test but they cannot force them. ""Yes, there is risk for doctors. But we educate them to undergo necessary tests. Our patients too agree to undergo tests. But we should not force them because they have the right to refuse to undergo tests,"" Dr A Charmila, a functionary of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India. Dr KS Devanathan, the president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Trichy, said HIV test is mandatory for all patients. ""As patients are not willing to disclose their health problems before undergoing surgery, tests are compulsorily done at all private hospitals so that doctors can be safe,"" said Dr Devanathan. "

The court said convicts Arjun (23) and Dharmender (24) were good friends and the circumstances which compelled them to plan the offence was the life threatening condition of Arjun's mother who died as she could not get proper treatment for her disease due to lack of money. ""There are strong chances of their reformation and any harsh view by this court at this stage would spoil their entire future and hence a lenient view is taken against the convicts,"" the judge said. The court also said that this was a case which should be treated as an ""exception"" and a lenient view should be taken against Arjun and Dharmender who were young and self-employed at the time of the incident and belonged to poor families. They have no previous history of crime. The court sentenced the duo to imprisonment of one year and 18 days which they have already spent behind bars. It also imposed a fine of Rs 2,500 and Rs 500 on Arjun and Dharmender, respectively. The court noted that Arjun's mother, who was now no more, was HIV positive and doctors at Bara Hindu Rao Hospital here had referred her to private hospitals where authorities refused to treat her unless the family gave money for the treatment. According to the prosecution, on December 26, 2012, Arjun and Dharmender had conspired to rob Rs 4.15 lakh from PP Jewellers, Karol Bagh. When complainant Mukesh, who was working as a field boy with PP Jewellers at Karol Bagh, reached Keshav Puram, Arjun robbed him of Rs 4.15 lakh using a pistol. The crime was facilitated by Dharmender, who was an employee of the jeweller."

The representatives of the social organizations pointed out that once an infant is born with HIV his life becomes challenging as there have been instances of the child being shifted to shelter homes by his close relatives after his HIV positive parents died. The organizations claimed that the transmission of virus from mother to newborn could be prevented by taking some medication, which minimizes transmission chance. More the HIV testing of pregnant women is done less would be the chances of newborns being infected with the virus. Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) is already conducting HIV tests of pregnant women through counseling. They take the women's consent before conducting the test. The RSACS said they have conducted tests on more than 6 lakh pregnant women for HIV in 2013, which could be nearly 33% of the total pregnant women giving birth to newborns every year, through proper counseling. The auxiliary nurse midwife and general nurse midwife counsel the women to take the test before she gives birth. So far, the new infections among children are 130, the social organizations claimed."

The attacker, a 42-year-old Agripada resident (name withheld by TOI), was subdued by ward boys and relatives of other patients in the third-floor general ward and handed over to the police. Dean T P Lahane said he seemed to display symptoms of schizophrenia. He has been admitted to a ward in JJ hospital, and his arms bound, said sources. He has been charged with murder, but is yet to be arrested. Police said around 6.30am, he came out of the toilet and attacked Thakur, whose lung cancer was in an advanced stage, but who was to be discharged in three days after a month’s stay in the hospital. “By the time, ward boys and patients’ relatives could stop him, he had smashed Thakur’s head,” said a source. Thakur was rushed to the hospital ICU, where he was pronounced dead after three hours. The Agripada resident also attacked two other patients—Praful Parmar (70) and Janardhan Arte (66)—who are in a stable condition. Thakur’s son Pankaj said his mother Miradevi had been at his father’s bedside since he was admitted on April 12. “On Monday morning, my mother had gone downstairs to bring medicines. The attack took place around that time. He hit father thrice with the rod, hurting his head. My father was bleeding profusely,” said Pankaj, who works in a private firm as administrator. “He had hit the other two patients on their heads too,” he added. The police said the people at the ward struggled to overpower the man. “He was so violent three to four men could not control him. Sister Alina Anthony, the nurse who is the complainant, said he was finally pinned down to a chair by several people, given a sedative injection and tied up,” said a policeman. The accused was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis meningitis at Bombay Hospital since May 8. “He is a known case of tuberculosis and HIV, and had been admitted here even last year with similar health complaints,” said Dr Sagar Sankhle, Bombay Hospital spokesperson. The accused had been cooperating with all diagnostic tests and had never showed any violent behaviour until Monday, he added. The accused used to work in a private firm until he was diagnosed with HIV. He then went into depression and was under treatment at several places before coming to the Marine Lines hospital, said the police. There was no enmity between the accused and Thakur, who came from Agra and worked as a taxi driver in Mumbai for over 30 years, or planning in the attack, said senior inspector Narendra Singh. Thakur, a resident of Pratiksha Nagar in Sion, is survived by his wife, three sons and two sisters. He needed regular clearing of lungs for fluid retention and was first admitted to the general ward. His health deteriorated and he was shifted to the ICU. “On April 30, he was brought back to the general ward. We were happy he was recovering and hoping to go home soon,” added Pankaj."

A study by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis found that dosage of rifabutin — a second-line drug for HIV-infected TB patients — prescribed by Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) is insufficient to tackle mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of the disease, one of the leading causes of death among AIDS/HIV+ patients. 	“The programme recommends 150mg of the drug thrice a week. But based on our studies of blood samples collected from 17 patients, we found that for 150mg of rifabutin to work, patients would have to take the drug every day,” said Dr Geetha Ramachandran, who led the study. 	The subjects of the study were all patients at Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram. All of them had failed to respond to first-line treatment. 	Researchers found that the RNTCP stipulated dosage administered to seven patients was too low to counter the disease. Four of the subjects died during the course of the study. 	“Ten of the patients, who received a dosage of around 30mg/ml higher than that prescribed by the RNTCP, showed favourable response to the treatment,” Dr Ramachandran said. 	Experts say the dosage of the drug has always been a matter of debate, with doctors exercising extra caution due to possible chemical interaction of medicines for HIV and TB. 	“While in some countries like the US, the dosage of rifabutin has been increased from 150mg three days a week to the same amount daily, in India insufficient data and studies resulted in health authorities failing to increase the dosage,” NIRT director Soumya Swaminathan said. 	The researchers have presented the results of the study to the National AIDS Control Organisation. “A multi-centric study will be undertaken in different parts of the country to assess the effect of rifabutin. This could change the drug regimen for HIV-positive patients with TB,” Dr Swaminathan said. 	Experts say 60%-70% of HIV-infected patients are likely to develop TB, mostly those on second-line therapy. 	“There are several factors that may lead to poor treatment outcome, including malnutrition and other infections. The dosage of rifabutin, which kills the bacteria, is also a contributing factor which can’t be taken lightly. Although we recommend daily dosage, more studies will be required to determine the optimal level,” Dr Ramachandran said. "

48,5,2014,New regimen to reduce HIV risk to infants,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/New-regimen-to-reduce-HIV-risk-to-infants/articleshow/35624311.cms,"JAIPUR: New multi-drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimen has been initiated in the state aiming to further reduce the risk of vertical HIV transmission from HIV infected mother to her newborn. The decision has been taken to promote birth of HIV-free children. The Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) has initiated lifelong multi-drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimens for all pregnant and breast-feeding women living with HIV. The transmission of HIV from infected mother to her newborn is one of the leading causes of spread of HIV. According to RSACS, it is estimated that 5.2% of total HIV infections are due to transmission of HIV from mother to newborn. To deal with it, earlier the RSACS was providing single dose of Nevirapine to such women at the time of labour pain to prevent the HIV transmission from mother to her newborn baby. But, from May 19, the RSACS has changed its strategy. Health department's project director (AIDS) Dr SS Chauhan said, ""From an HIV infected mother, the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to newborn is 30%. But, a single dose of Nevirapine reduces the risk to around 15%. So far we were giving single dose of Nevirapine to pregnant women at the time of delivery. But, still the high risk (up to 15%) remained the cause of concern for us. Now, to bring down the percentage of risk of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to her newborn, we have initiated the lifelong ART (triple drug regimen). The multidrug ARV regimen would further decrease the risk from 11% to up to 5%. It will be the major benefit of the new multidrug regimen."" The triple drug regimen includes — Tenofovir, Lamivudine and Efavirenz. The three drugs would be administered to the women living with HIV and her infant. The drug would continue lifelong to reduce mortality and morbidity in mothers and children. The RSACS is spreading awareness of HIV testing among pregnant women. They take consent of pregnant women for HIV testing. If the women test positive for HIV, they link the women with anti retroviral therapy centre. Also, they put effort to prevent the transmission of HIV to her newborn. In 2013-14, the RSACS conducted HIV testing on 4.68 lakh pregnant women and found 412 women living with HIV. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV. They have linked the newborns with antiretroviral therapy centres. An RSACS official said that they have provided training to its staff to start the new multidrug regimen. The new multidrug ARV regimen is part of prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT) of HIV launched in 2001-02 by ministry of health and family welfare."

Speaking at a conference, 'Coming together-a partnership for public health' organised in the city on Friday, organizers said FICCI will explore avenues to extend support to the vulnerable population in both states. ""At a time when international funding is dwindling for the HIV programme in India, partnership with corporate donors for continuous investment to improve health of the marginalised populations in India is important,"" said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, director, Avahan Programme Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Experts said there is an urgent need for partnership between the corporate sector and NGOs for improving public health and provide livelihood opportunities to marginalised sections. ""There is a sharp increase in cases of violence against sex workers. We are looking at involving corporates to provide funding to initiate an alternate livelihood skills mechanism for these women,"" said Dr P Prabhakar, director, India HIV AIDS Alliance, Andhra Pradesh. A budget of about Rs five crore is required to take up the skill development programme, he said. ""The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) does not provide funding for such a programme,"" said Dr Prabhakar. Currently, the united state of AP has the highest population of people living with HIV AIDS - an estimated five lakh people. The AP State Aids Control Society is reaching out to 1.52 lakh sex workers and 40,000 men having sex with men through its initiatives. ""With the advent of New Companies Act 2013 and special emphasis on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), support for initiatives would immensely help corporates and NGOS to eradicate sexually transmitted diseases including HIV AIDS in the days to come,"" said Sangita Reddy, chairperson, FICCI. During 2014-15, Corporate India is supposed to spend an estimated Rs 20,000 crore on corporate social responsibility (CSR) as per the mandatory regulation introduced this year. ""The regulation says that the corporate firms are supposed to spend two per cent of their net profits on CSR,"" said Rony Antony, director, Tax and Regulatory Services, KPMG. If the money is pumped into the right initiatives, it can transform the public health system for good, he said. ""Firms can partner with NGOs and fulfill their CSR initiatives. They can earmark specific funding for HIV AIDS and other programmes on healthcare,"" he added."

A senior official of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society said, ""We get funds from the Union government to run ICTC and ART centres. There are some technical issues that need to be sorted out before absorbing the staff in permanent services. The work of ART centres has not been affected much due to the strike.

He had raped his seven-year-old niece and then strangled her at Kasegaon village in Sangli in 2011. The bench comprising justices V K Tahilramani and V L Achliya observed, ""There can be no doubt that the offence committed by the accused deserves severe condemnation and it is a heinous crime, but on looking at the cumulative facts and on balancing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, we do not think that the case falls in the category of rarest of rare cases. Hence, we are not inclined to confirm the death sentence."" On March 26, 2013, the district and sessions court at Islampur had convicted and sentenced him to death for raping and murdering the girl. The victim, a resident of Sangli, was studying in standard two in a local school. The prosecution's case is that on February 26, 2011, the man had taken the girl from school to Kalammawadi, near Kasegaon in Walva tehsil and raped her in a sugarcane field. He then strangled her and fled to Pune. When the girl did not come back from school, her mother told her husband. He inquired with the school teacher who had told him that she had gone with her maternal uncle. After a search, the girl's father registered a criminal case with the Kasegaon police station. The rapist was arrested after investigations revealed his involvement in the crime. The victim's body was recovered from the sugarcane field. The trial court had sentenced him to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape under section 376 (2) (f) of the IPC. He was also sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment each for kidnapping and destroying evidence under sections 363 and 201 of the IPC. The trial court had sent a reference to the high court for confirming the death sentence. He had also filed a criminal appeal challenging the death sentence in the high court. Additional public prosecutor Mankuwar Deshmukh relied on aggravating circumstances to prove that the accused had brutally raped and murdered a defenceless girl. She pleaded to confirm death sentence as the girl was last seen in the company of the accused. She relied on the DNA report to prove that the blood stains found on the victim's frock matched his blood group. She submitted that the rapist was a habitual offender as he had two cases registered against him with the Chinchwad police station here in 2009 and 2011. The HC later found that he had been acquitted in both the cases. The HC appointed lawyer Abhaykumar Apte to represent the man from its legal aid committee. Apte argued that police had not recorded his statement to show that the dead body was recovered at his instance. He also challenged the identification parade of the accused on the grounds that the witnesses had seen him at the police station. The HC's observations Quoting several Supreme Court judgments, the HC bench said, ""The man was suffering from HIV and this was the only mitigating circumstance in his favour for commuting his death sentence to life imprisonment."" The HC also sought his doctor's advice on whether his life span will be that of an ordinary man if he continued with the medicines. While partly allowing his appeal, the HC on examining the evidence maintained his conviction under sections of the IPC, but commuted the death sentence given for murder to life imprisonment. The HC also commuted the life imprisonment awarded for rape to 10 years RI. However, both the sentences will run consecutively. The sentences of three years RI each awarded for kidnapping and destruction of evidence will run concurrently. The judgment was delivered on May 8 and posted on the HC website on June 18."

As they innocently await a new set of books and uniforms, the nuns who run the home are struggling to find a school willing to admit the children. The problem arose when the nuns approached a school close to the home and the children were refused admission as 14 of them were HIV+. Despite there being two other schools closer to the institute, the nuns then approached a school in Sulcorna, that is about 15km away. The Sulcorna school decided to admit the children, but ran into trouble when parents objected. Sources in the Sulcorna school management said parents of other students objected to HIV+ children sharing space with their children and threatened to pull out their children from the school if the HIV+ children were admitted. ?Some parents even sought school leaving certificates for their children, school sources said. Speaking to TOI, the head of the children's institute said, ""The parents believe that if their children mingle with children with HIV, they would be exposed to the infection."" To allay such fears, Indian medical association (IMA) Goa state president Dr Jagadish Cacodkar had a session with the school's parent teachers association (PTA) to explain that ""merely mixing with HIV positive persons does not pass the infection"". Some 200 PTA members attended the session and Cacodkar claimed they appeared satisfied with the explanation and reasoning. Cacodkar said the opposition by parents was a result of misconception. ""The main reason parents object is because AIDS is incurable. The psychological fear of contracting a deadly disease coupled with misconception about its transition has compounded their ignorance. Their biggest misconception is that HIV is contagious,"" he said. ""They were explained why it is not possible to get an infection if you touch a HIV positive person, share a seat with one or even when you eat from a common plate,"" he said. Even late Friday evening, the nuns were in talks with the parents and the school management, and remained hopeful that all the children from their home will be admitted. ""I can say that 95% of the problem is sorted out. Consultative efforts to change the outlook of parents seems to be finally yielding results,"" the nun said. Until last academic year the 14 HIV positive children were schooled in the home. It was only this year that, emboldened by the Supreme Court decision in March that asked Central and state governments to end discrimination against HIV positive children during school admission, the nuns decided to admit them in a public school. While they almost succeeded, their attempt was derailed by parents. How HIV spreads The virus can be transmitted only through body fluids like blood, semen or breast milk. HIV cannot spread through saliva, sweat or by touching. The virus finds it hard to survive outside of bodily fluids You cannot catch HIV by Breathing the same air as someone who is HIV+ Hugging, kissing, or shaking hands with someone who is HIV+ Touching a toilet seat or doorknob after an HIV+ person Sharing food with an HIV+ person "

Particularly because it was a reversal of its own conscious and bold decision taken only a few days ago to admit those students on ""humanitarian grounds"". When the Salesian priests came to Sulcorna over 50 years ago, they transformed large swathes of jungle areas into a farm, growing sugarcane, cashew, and other cash crops, employing locals as farmhands and helping the needy. Today the Don Bosco Agro-Ed Complex at Sulcorna, situated on a sprawling lush land, has grown into a hub of educational, agricultural and social activities. ""Besides playing a pioneering role in the remote villages along this hinterland belt in the field of agriculture, horticulture, watershed development etc, the activities of Don Bosco Sulcorna, have always been village-centric. We have taken utmost care of the villagers all these years and the locals hold us in high esteem. We are always the first to reach out to them in their times of need. We have always fought for protecting the interests of the villagers. We have helped them form self-help groups and cooperative societies, besides helping the young in gaining employment. Though our students come from a poor background, they excel in studies and are on par with those from the urban schools. Our relationship with the villagers is close knit and we share a mutual trust,"" sources in the school management told TOI. Sources within the local community confirmed that it was exactly because of the villagers' sense of attachment and belonging to Don Bosco school that they felt ""let down"" by the school management when it granted admission to HIV positive students residing ""far away"" from the village. The school management is now concerned about the probable withdrawal of students by their parents in case admission is granted to the HIV positive students. The HIV positive students have also been denied admission in at least two other schools located in the vicinity of the children's home in which they are lodged, it is reliably learnt. It was exactly because of such discrimination against HIV positive students that the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, an organization which runs a care home for orphaned and vulnerable children, had moved the Supreme Court, invoking the fundamental rights to life, education and equality guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. The foundation had pointed out that based on their own HIV status or that of their parents or guardians, children affected by HIV face multiple forms of discrimination in schools. It was on this PIL that on March 3, the Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and all states to declare HIV positive children as a disadvantaged group under the Right to Education (RTE) Act to ensure they got education without discrimination. Section 9(c) of the Act says, ""Every local authority shall ensure that the child belonging to weaker section and the child belonging to disadvantaged group are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education on any grounds."""

The inquiry will also seek to find out who leaked the information of the children being HIV+, a matter that should have been kept confidential. At a meeting on Monday, the commission decided that a two-member team will visit the school on Thursday to investigate. ""We will fix an appointment with the school and we will meet the school management, the parents and hear out all the concerned parties. We will also speak to education officials. First we will investigate who leaked out such confidential information, as it can have many adverse consequences for the children involved,"" commission chairperson Sameera Kazi said. The objection by parents of other children to the 13 HIV positive children's admission, first reported by TOI, had Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) hold a meeting on Monday and decide that the home where the children are housed should be visited to check its state. ""We discussed the issue threadbare and felt that there is a need for creating more awareness in rural areas. We have decided on a strategy for generating awareness about the disease. Since we don't know what is the ground reality in the institute with HIV positive children at the Zambaulim care home, our team will visit the institute to check out the position. We will take a decision thereafter,"" GSACS project director Dr Vandana Patankar said. Education officials, on the other hand, were yet to intervene in the case as of Monday to secure admission to the children as promised by state education ministry. NGOs working with HIV positive persons in Goa also expressed their anger at the maltreatment of the children. ""Stigma attached to HIV/AIDs has still not gone. We have to motivate people-children as well as parents. The decision of some parents to oppose admission of HIV positive children is not right. The time has come to treat the issue very seriously,"" Positive People board member Raj Vaidya said. Human Touch founder Peter Borges said, ""A few days ago those kids were part of my camp. I want to help them and have been in touch with Church authorities. Two years ago, a similar problem had cropped up at a children's home in Tivim. We spoke to the parent teachers association (PTA) and succeeded in resolving the issue. GSACS should play a more pro-active role to resolve this issue. I think the problem arose because awareness is lacking. Earlier, HIV positive children did not live long but with anti-retroviral treatment (ART) their life span is increasing. Considering this fact, we have to bring them in mainstream society."" "
60,6,2014,Team to meet stakeholders in HIV+ kids' admission issue,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Team-to-meet-stakeholders-in-HIV-kids-admission-issue/articleshow/37139879.cms,"MARGAO: The education department on Monday deputed a team to meet the stakeholders over the admission issue to HIV+ children in South Goa's hinterland. Sources said that the department will take necessary action based on a report which it will get from the team in a day or two. The sources said that the department is working out a solution taking into consideration views from all stakeholders. Being a sensitive matter, the government doesn't want to make public the proposal for a solution fearing that it might go against the interest of the children, the sources said. A couple of meetings took place on Tuesday to resolve the issue. The government has involved bodies like Goa state aids control society to come out of the imbroglio. Confidentiality is also being maintained as parents of children studying in a Sulcorna school threatened to withdraw their wards en masse if the HIV+ children were admitted in the school. The Sulcorna school was in a fix as it had on humanitarian grounds decided to admit the children after two schools close to the children's home where they were housed, had reportedly refused to admit them. Though the education department was initially reluctant to intervene, officials went into a pro-active mode after the chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who is also the education minister, stated that the government would not tolerate any discrimination. An official said that the government will ensure that the Supreme Court directions are implemented - that there is no discrimination to HIV children in getting admission to a neighbourhood school. A source said that the education department is also working on adopting some preventive steps so that such cases do not occur in the future. In March 2014, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and all states on a PIL to declare HIV-affected children as a disadvantaged group under Right to Education Act (RTE), to ensure that they get admission without any discrimination. The Goa state commission for protection of child rights as well as GSACS members have decided to meet the stakeholders. The former will also inquire into the leakage of information of the children who are HIV positive."

""CRG is anguished with the response of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) of Fatima High School at Rivona, who are threatening to boycott the school if the management gives admission to 13 HIV positive students. Denying admission to children affected with HIV is a violation of the rights of the child under the Indian Constitution, child-related laws in India and international covenants that India has ratified,"" the CRG has said. It has pointed out that the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act guarantees education to all children irrespective of any illness, caste, creed and disability. Section 9 (c) ensures that ?the child belonging to weaker sections and the child belonging to disadvantaged groups are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education on any grounds.' ""One would have thought that most people would be aware that HIV is not contagious and cannot be spread if a child sits next to a child infected with HIV. We also appeal to all parents of Goa not to resort to such kind of discriminatory behaviour towards HIV affected children. They too have dreams to study like any other child,"" the CRG statement said."
62,7,2014,Massive blow: 'Miracle girl' cured of HIV as a baby is suffering from virus again,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Massive-blow-Miracle-girl-cured-of-HIV-as-a-baby-is-suffering-from-virus-again/articleshow/38209433.cms,"LONDON: A four-year-old girl who had emerged as the beacon of hope for the global fight against AIDS, when she was cured of HIV after being born to an infected mother has now been found with “detectable levels of HIV”. In a massive blow to scientists, the child known as the “Mississippi baby” who when put on antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 hours of birth was cured last year by halting the formation of hard-to-treat viral reservoirs — dormant cells responsible for reigniting the infection in most HIV patients within weeks of stopping the therapy has now been found to have been re-infected after more than two years of not taking ART. “Certainly, this is a disappointing turn of events for this young child, the medical staff involved in the child’s care, and the HIV/AIDS research community,” said NIAID director Anthony S Fauci. “Scientifically, this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body”. A routine clinical care visit earlier this month has revealed that the child has detectable HIV levels in the blood (16,750 copies/mL). Repeat viral load blood testing performed 72 hours later confirmed this finding (10,564 copies/mL of virus). Additionally, the child had decreased levels of CD4+ T-cells, a key component of a normal immune system, and the presence of HIV antibodies — signals of an actively replicating pool of virus in the body. The child was again started on ART. Genetic sequencing of the virus indicated that the child’s HIV infection was the same strain acquired from the mother. Delegates pray for individuals that have perished due to HIV-AIDS at the 31st International AIDS Candlelight Memorial in Manila (Getty Images) The child continues to receive medical care, treatment and monitoring from Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who has been involved in the child’s care since birth. Researchers say they will now work to better understand what enabled the child to remain off treatment for more than two years without detectable virus or measurable immunologic response and what might be done to extend the period of sustained HIV remission in the absence of ART. “The fact that this child was able to remain off antiretroviral treatment for two years and maintain quiescent virus for that length of time is unprecedented,” said Deborah Persaud, professor of infectious diseases at the John Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore and one of the two pediatric HIV experts involved in the ongoing analysis of the case. “Typically, when treatment is stopped, HIV levels rebound within weeks, not years”. Quilts embroidered with the names of AIDS victims (Getty Images) “The case of the Mississippi child indicates that early antiretroviral treatment in this HIV-infected infant did not completely eliminate the reservoir of HIV-infected cells that was established upon infection but may have considerably limited its development and averted the need for antiretroviral medication over a considerable period,” said Dr Fauci. “Now we must direct our attention to understanding why that is and determining whether the period of sustained remission in the absence of therapy can be prolonged even further.” HIV first sprung its head over 30 years ago and has till now infected over 34 million people worldwide. Finding a vaccine against HIV has been a daunting challenge. The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world. In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011. In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children. The baby in question was born prematurely in a Mississippi clinic in 2010 to an HIV-infected mother who did not receive ART medication during pregnancy and was not diagnosed with HIV infection until the time of delivery. Because of the high risk of HIV exposure, the infant was started at 30 hours of age on liquid, triple-drug antiretroviral treatment. Testing confirmed within several days that the baby had been infected with HIV. At two weeks of age, the baby was discharged from the hospital and continued on liquid antiretroviral therapy. The baby continued on antiretroviral treatment until 18 months of age, when the child was lost to follow up and no longer received treatment. Yet, when the child was again seen by medical staff five months later, blood samples revealed undetectable HIV levels (less than 20 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood (copies/mL)) and no HIV-specific antibodies. The child continued to do well in the absence of antiretroviral medicines and was free of detectable HIV for more than two years. “The prolonged lack of viral rebound, in the absence of HIV-specific immune responses, suggests that the very early therapy not only kept this child clinically well, but also restricted the number of cells harboring HIV infection,” said Katherine Luzuriaga, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. A Global Plan on HIV has two main targets for 2015: a 90% reduction in the number of children newly infected with HIV and a 50% reduction in the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths. The Plan focuses on the 22 countries which account for 90% of new HIV infections among children which includes India. "
63,7,2014,HIV stigma: strategic long-term plan vital,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/HIV-stigma-strategic-long-term-plan-vital/articleshow/38336890.cms,"With the issue of HIV related stigma and discrimination being addressed in the state, I have attempted to put more light on the issue. There is need to understand the issue, not only in relation to the children who are facing discrimination, but close to 14,000 odd HIVpositive individuals found positive in Goa. Rivona case should help us to strategize for a long term impact. Goa had set an example to the rest of country three decades ago and had created an impact in addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination. India's first HIV litigation arose when HIVpositive activist Dominic D'Souza was incarcerated in the late 1980s. D'Souza, a resident of Goa, was found to be HIVpositive when he donated blood at a Goa hospital. The test was performed without his knowledge or consent, and the results were revealed not to him, but to the local police. D'Souza was subsequently arrested and confined in an unused TB sanatorium pursuant to the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act, 1985, an amendment to which in 1986 authorized the state to mandatorily test any person for HIV and isolate them if they tested HIVpositive. He challenged the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which called for mandatory isolation of an HIVpositive person. He won a partial victory when the court ruled detainment was mandatory only in a ""justifiable"" case. His legacy continues through Positive, the NGO he started to help people living with HIV. Dominic's case highlighted several aspects of the laws that are related to the HIV epidemic beyond the application (or mis-application) of public health laws. Dominic was tested for HIV without his consent, his confidentiality was breached, and eventually, when he was released, he had lost his job. Since that first case, violations of the rights of people living with or affected by HIV have increasingly come to light, many legal cases have been fought and won or lost, and many judgments have been pronounced by the courts. It should be understood that those who stigmatize people living with HIV falsely believe that the virus is highly contagious and that they could easily become infected. When that happens, others start to view HIV-positive as a threat. Many become isolated - within their homes, in public, at their workplaces. They are further stigmatized by others' assumptions about their moral integrity - such as the belief that they became infected with HIV because they chose to take part in risky behaviors. Also, stigma and discrimination continue to undermine prevention, treatment and care of people living with the HIV and AIDS. It hinders those with the virus from telling their partners about their status. It threatens their access to health care. It increases their vulnerability to physical violence. And HIV-related stigma affects people's ability to earn a living, making it even more difficult for them to lift themselves out of poverty. HIV and AIDS have highlighted such vast inequities, violent abuse and widespread stigma, that human rights have been violated in a manner and on a scale rarely witnessed before in the public health sphere. The HIV epidemic cannot be looked upon as just a medical problem. It touches on the most personal behaviours and aspects of people's lives, and its effect is felt in every sphere of a person's life. Combating it therefore demands an approach that integrates social, cultural, economic and human rights perspectives. While we discuss this, I wish to bring to fore more issues related to this. Once an adolescent finds out about his or her HIV status, disclosure, safer sex and family planning become pressing issues, requiring services tailored to the specific needs of adolescents. Despite the growing importance of this population group, they are largely left out of HIV/AIDS responses in the state. One effect is that existing paediatric and adult services are often ill-equipped to deal with their complex needs. This emerging situation underscores the need to recognize these adolescents in Goa as well, learn more about their lives, identify their preventive information needs and service priorities, and design appropriate programs for their special needs. Civil society organizations and the state at large, need to have planned and sustainable programmes for children, rather address issues as they come to the fore. While, I highlight the above, I also wish to bring to the attention of public at large, some of the instances of stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV in Goa. Discrimination in medical setting is widely prevalent. Surprisingly, even I came across staff of an NGO working in the premises of GMC to provide services, identifying HIV patients and alerting others to maintain distance. Some who are availing 50% bus concession from KTC also face discrimination by conductors who sometimes grill them on the card and also deny them concession. Most of the migrant PLHIVs, including children are denied social entitlement and social security schemes. People accessing DSS schemes are constantly under fear and sometimes refrain from accessing schemes due to fear of status being revealed. The government besides providing some social entitlements should also focus on long term HIV impact mitigation. It's high time that all stakeholders working to address HIV in the state come together on a common platform and address HIV through need-based, planned and sustained programmes. It requires commitment, courage and leadership at all levels. (The writer is the founder of Human Touch and secretary of Positive People.

TCIF is working towards to enhancing HIV awareness among the truckers so that they are safe from the disease. ""Volleyball is organized near the office of Chandigarh Transport Association everyday. This interests the truckers and cleaners and they participate eagerly in this game,"" said Dr Vanita Gupta, project director, UT SACS. Three teams of 10 players each have been made, including various stakeholders. A handout on HIV is provided during the play. Interpersonal communication and group meetings during the game are also used to motivate the players and their friends to undergo HIV testing to promote safe behaviour, including the use of condoms. This is an ongoing activity and has been a successful way of promoting safe behaviour among the truckers. Truck drivers spend long periods of time away from home. Studies have shown that around a quarter to a third of long-distance truckers pay for sex whilst working away. Truck drivers constitute a well-known bridge population for the infection and transmission of HIV/AIDS due to migratory nature of their work."

Strongly objecting to the post that states: ""The Goa church loves everyone except HIV+ kids,"" Kamat demanded that a FIR be filed against Swamy for ""attempting to create and promote enmity against the Catholic Church"". He said the post is clearly an offence coming within the ambit of Sections 153 and 153-A of the IPC and as it is in cyberspace, an offence needs to be registered against the BJP leader under Section 66A of Information Technology Act. The complaint states that by accusing the church of loving everyone except HIV positive children, Swamy ""has tried to give a communal and political twist to a very sensitive issue by trying to portray the church in Goa as not being sensitive towards HIV positive orphans"". The issue pertains to admission of 13 HIV positive students from a community care centre run by Catholic nuns in Sanguem taluka. As nearby schools did not admit the students, a school in Sulcorna run by Salesian priests volunteered to admit the children but as parents of other students objected, they were not admitted. When parents objected to the children's admission in another school, this time in Rivona, the children were denied admission here too. The controversy in the last three weeks is over the admission of 23 orphans who grew up with the HIV positive students in the same community care centre. Stating that the BJP leader has made an insensitive statement without knowing facts, Kamat pointed out that the community care centre where these children are being taken care of is run by church institutions. Kamat in the complaint said that the post on Swamy's page is trying to influence public opinion against the minority community ""and communalize and politicize a sensitive issue under the garb of public service"". Panaji police said they have received the complaint and are studying the matter. As for the sections of IPC and IT Act mentioned in the complaint, an official at the Panaji police station said, ""We will have to talk to our superiors."""
67,7,2014,Kick-and-kill strategy boosts HIV cure effort,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Kick-and-kill-strategy-boosts-HIV-cure-effort/articleshow/38894849.cms,"MELBOURNE: The elusive quest for an HIV cure received a boost at the world AIDS conference on Tuesday as scientists said they had forced the virus out of a hiding place where it had lurked after being suppressed by drugs. The experiment, carried out with six HIV-infected volunteers, is an important advance in the so-called kick-and-kill approach for a cure, they said. The technique aims to force the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from its last redoubt after it is beaten back by antiretroviral drugs. These drugs can bring HIV in the blood to below detectable levels, enabling sick patients to return almost miraculously to normal life. But the therapy has to be taken every day, is costly and carries potential side effects. If the drugs are stopped, HIV usually rebounds within a few weeks and starts once more to infect other immune cells, exposing the body to opportunistic microbes. For the past three years, scientists have focused on ways to kick HIV out of its bolthole and then kill the hideaway cells. In a presentation at the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark described a step forward in the first stage of this process. Six patients on antiretrovirals took an anti-cancer drug called romidepsin, which prompted virus production in HIV-infected cells to crank up to between 2.1 and 3.9 times above normal. In five patients, the level of virus in the blood increased to measurable levels, an important threshold. agencies "

This has led to 778 out of 2437 HIV positive people, who are on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART), being unsure about the prognosis of their disease. After initial clamour from AIDS activists on July 10, three portable but temporary CD4 machines were provided to Kiphire, Zunheboto and Tuensang districts. But activists say the new machines are for an interim period and meant for affected people in the interior areas only. Nagaland has only four CD4 count machines in Mokochung, Tuensang, Dimapur and Kohima that are 9 to 10 years old and were brought from other states. Network of Naga People living with HIV/AIDS (NNP+) and Nagaland Users Network (NUN) have cited the situation as a ?continued negligence' on the part of the Department of AIDS Control (previously called NACO) and Nagaland State Aids Control Society (NSACS). Altogether, 2437 HIV positive people from Tuensang district of Nagaland are facing uncertainty about their present status of HIV drug treatment. CD4 testing is important in HIV treatment as it puts newly detected patients on Anti Retroviral (ARV) for regular monitoring of the present treatment. ""WHO, in its guidelines (2013), recommends more efficient test - viral load testing for treatment and monitoring to ensure adherence and timely switch to next line regimen. It is really shocking that even the basic CD4 testing is not being made available to us at the community level,"" said Naomi, President of NNP+. The networks wrote to the DAC on March 7 ,to apprise them of the frequent breakdown of the machines in 4 ART centres in Dimapur, Kohima, Mokokchung and Tuensang district Hospitals. The networks have questioned the functionality of the machines. Even a RTI was filled by a community member. ""DAC's inability to tackle this problem means disrupting a patients' treatment. They should stop playing with people's lives and put their act together.

The pregnant woman, who hails from a village under Gola block of Ramgarh district, gave birth to a child after a 14-hour ordeal. While she was in labour, one of the nurses assisting her was mistakenly pricked by the needle meant for the woman. Sources in the hospital said none of the medical staff was aware that the patients was HIV+ till her mother-in-law asked the nurses to administer her an injection meant for HIV positive mothers. This came as a shock to the medical staff and the nurse who was hurt by the needle used in the HIV positive woman. The nurse was immediately referred to Rims to run necessary medical tests on her. Confirming the news, Dr Ashok Ram, medical officer in charge of the government hospital, said the mother-in-law of the pregnant woman told him that her son is HIV positive so it’s likely that her daughter-in-law may have got the infection too. However, he added, “We can’t confirm if the nurse is infected as the test reports are pending.” Doctors at the government hospital suspect that the newborn too is HIV positive. Hospital sources said the names of the HIV positive couple are registered with Rims and the doctors there had asked them to get admitted in Rims at the time of delivery. Dr Ramesh Kumar Srivastava at Rims said no pathological test could immediately detect the virus. “If there is an accidental prick by an HIV-infected needle, the person must undergo prophylactic treatment at the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Rims. No pathological test can immediately establish whether the person has got infected with HIV or not. But after a gap of three to four days, neuclic acid test can confirm the presence of Human Immune Viruses,” said the professor of pathology at Rims. He added that such medical accidents are not rare and they often get cases related to doctors performing surgery on AIDS patients and being bruised or pricked accidently, but in most of the cases immediate ART treatment helps avert chances of being infected.

71,7,2014,HIV model can beat hepatitis,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/HIV-model-can-beat-hepatitis/articleshow/39185553.cms,"NEW DELHI: Eradication of polio and HIV/AIDS has been two major successes in health sector in India. On World Hepatitis Day on Monday, World Health Organization called for using similar strategies and infrastructure to check the spread of infection caused by Hepatitis viruses. The issue was discussed at the first roundtable consultation on viral hepatitis organized by WHO at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. ""The HIV/AIDS programme in India has been successful mainly because of its robust sentinel surveillance mechanism, involvement of community health workers and NGOs to spread awareness and availability of free drugs. These strategies and infrastructure can be used to spread awareness about Hepatitis B and C that follow similar modes of transmission,"" said Dr Nicole Seguy, technical advisor at the WHO country office. There are five main hepatitis viruses, of which B and C cause the most fatalities as these can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Dr Seguy said preventive measures such as compulsory vaccination for Hepatitis B, promoting safe sex and screening of blood for infections at the time of transfusion can help check the spread of diseases. ""Though there is treatment available for Hepatitis C, few can afford it. The government should make efforts to subsidize or make drugs available for free to those infected,"" she added. Dr S K Sarin, director of ILBS, said a key recommendation made by the experts group at the WHO meet was that the government should utilize services of 17,000 HIV surveillance centres for screening Hepatitis B and C patients. ""If one person in the family has Hepatitis B, chances of others having it are high. It is important to screen them for the virus before vaccination because the vaccines can only protect uninfected patients,"" he said. Nata Menabde, WHO representative to India, also stressed on the need for reliable information on viral hepatitis for building prevention and control measures. ""WHO calls upon all partners and stakeholders to make the 'silent' epidemic of viral hepatitis more visible and more manageable,"" she said. ""We have had massive awareness campaigns for polio, HIV or tuberculosis in our country. Hepatitis is also one such disease which can be prevented to a large extent if people know about it,"" said Dr S K Acharya, HOD, gastroenterology, at AIIMS. According to him, patients get to know about the disease at a very late stage."
72,7,2014,Lack of awareness among general public in Goa about HIV/AIDS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Lack-of-awareness-among-general-public-in-Goa-about-HIV/AIDS/articleshow/39190676.cms,"PANAJI: The parent teacher association (PTA) body's refusal to allow admission to HIV-positive children in a Rivona school has brought into sharp focus the lack of awareness about HIV/ AIDS among the general population in the state though Goa state aids control society (GSACS), a nodal department entrusted with enlightening people about HIV, is active for over a decade. While GSACS is given credit for generating awareness about the deadly disease among high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers, truck drivers, motorcycle pilots, the Sanguem incident emphasizes the GSACS' need to also focus on the general population and work towards eliminating stigma attached to HIV AIDS. Raj Vaidya who works for Positive People, a NGO working for HIV/AIDS, says besides creating awareness, more importantly, GSACS will have to now work towards doing away with stigma, and discrimination that HIV-infected people face. ""A lot of work has to be done,"" he says indicating that it will be a mammoth task. Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, who is well aware of the task before her, said though they have started awareness programmes and workshops are being conducted, she says it will be a while before people come to really understand the issue and bury their prejudices. She said the issue is complicated as there is no cure for HIV/AIDS. Present day parents, most of whom have one or two children, become too protective about their children even though HIV is not contagious. ""Two or three decades ago, parents rarely bothered who their children's classmates in schools were, with whom they play with. But today the scene is different,"" she says. The situation, she says is not synonymous to Goa alone. ""It is a phobia among the general population and the disease is a stumbling block,"" she says. In their revised efforts to ally fear about HIV/AIDS among the general population, she said they have started involving people at all levels. ""We are engaging panchayat representatives, health officials and other to pass on the message,"" she added. A school teacher from a Mapusa school said many teachers are themselves ignorant about the disease or at times, despite of being well aware that merely touching or sitting next to a HIV-positive person will not get them an infection, they will still refuse to mix with HIV-positive persons. ""This I have gathered from hearing teachers talk in the staffroom. What they feel about HIV-infected people. It is sad,"" she said.

Vaidya also observed the efforts should not be half-hearted otherwise in future there will be more instances of schools closing their doors on children suffering HIV."
73,7,2014,Goa education minister says HIV+ kids' admissions issue resolved,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Goa-education-minister-says-HIV-kids-admissions-issue-resolved/articleshow/39318667.cms,"PORVORIM: Chief minister-cum-education minister Manohar Parrikar told the legislative assembly on Wednesday that the issue of admissions of children of a community care centre to a school in Rivona has been resolved. Parrikar said the issue arose because of ignorance about HIV. ""People are educated but it does mean they are knowledgable,"" he said, explaining the ways in which HIV is spread. ""Bring a HIV-positive boy here and I'm willing to eat from his plate,"" he said by way of example, while responding to a calling attention motion tabled by Sanguem MLA Subhash Phaldesai. The management of the centre had to battle for over a month to find a school for its 37 children, of whom 13 are HIV positive, after parents of students at two schools stiffly opposed the admissions. Parrikar said the news about the children's illness was leaked to the parents of other students of Fatima High School, Rivona. The parents then started demanding cancellation of the admission and the school was compelled to close for a few days. The problem has now been resolved with the intervention of the local MLA, officials of the directorate of education, Goa sarva shiksha abhiyan, Goa state commission for protection of child rights, health department and district administration, said Parrikar. The HIV-positive children have also been admitted to a school, he said, adding that in the interest of the children he would not mention the name of the school. He said the role of Fatima high school has also not been above board. ""The school, knowingly or unknowingly leaked information about the medical health of some students, which is against provisions of the RTE Act,"" said Parrikar. He said the school's role in the whole matter will be further investigated. "

As if the trauma of losing their parents to HIV/AIDS at a tender age was not enough, neighbours had closed their doors on these HIV-positive orphans. 	Facing protest and discrimination from neighbours, the girls had to vacate their special home — an apartment in Puna area of the city. 	This is when a city-based businessman extended a helping hand — Mahesh Savani of PP Savani Group offered his plush farmhouse to accommodate these girls. 	Today, these girls, whose number has grown to 49, not only enjoy their accommodation at the farmhouse but also pursue their education in a school near by. 	Since last one year the girls have not suffered from any infection, which was otherwise routine for them. 	“HIV/AIDS medicines of six girls have been discontinued as their CD4 counts have improved and they are in a better condition. These girls now believe that they are not just patients but also human beings,” says Savani. He has even named his farmhouse ‘Janani Dham’. CD4 cells, also known as T-helper cells, are a type of white blood cells that fight infection. 	At their previous shelter, these girls were banned from playing in the residential campus. Following objections, Gujarat State Network for Positive People (GSNP+), the NGO taking care of the girls, was forced to relocate the girls. But with limited budget they had no other option than to ask government for accommodation facility. 	After Savani offered his farmhouse, these girls have a sprawling garden and a play area equipped with a couple of rides for their recreation. 	“Living in a lush green area has helped create positivity among them and it has improved their health. No major infections as well as improvements in CD4 count reflect their healthy condition. They can now access good education and meet other citizens regularly,” says Daksha Patel, vice-president of GSNP+. 	Savani is now planning to accommodate HIV+ widows at the same farmhouse. 	“If things move ahead as planned, we will soon support HIV+ women by offering them home at ‘Janani Dham’. I believe it will improve life for both the women and the girls,” says Savani, who owns a chain of schools in the city. "
75,8,2014,HIV positive patients made to run in circles,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/HIV-positive-patients-made-to-run-in-circles/articleshow/39905748.cms,"PATNA: A National Aids Control Organistion (NACO) ad has caught attention of many: A five-year-old's HIV positive mom is lying unattended at a hospital. The boy rushes to the doctor's chamber, takes his coat and runs back. The doctor and nurse rush behind him. Back with mom, the child says he resorted to the ?theft' just to bring his mother's case to the doctor's notice. Has the message percolated down to the doctors? Apparently not. A 45-year old HIV+ woman died at the PMCH after being denied surgery to remove intestinal obstruction in September last year. Amid much hue and cry, the state health department promised a slew of reforms to ensure people with HIV were not denied healthcare for their other ailments, but they seem to have remained on paper. Even the Patna high court's prods in this regard have gone in vain. Had it not been so, 45-yr-old Ram Kumar would not have been made to run from pillar to post ? from IGIMS to NMCH to PMCH, to be precise ? to get his urethra dilated. More than ten visits to these government healthcare facilities notwithstanding, Kumar remains untreated. It was on August 4, 2009 that Kumar visited the IGIMS' urology department for the first time. Investigations were conducted on him. ""However, when it was discovered that I am HIV positive, I was told to go away. As my condition deteriorated, I visited the hospital again after four days. They again said it was not possible to operate me at the IGIMS,"" he said. As the complications increased, Kumar visited a private doctor. He prescribed treatment for a year but the surgery became a must. Kumar went to the NMCH in December 2013. He was refused surgery there too and was instead ""referred to PMCH/IGIMS."" To try his luck for the third time, the patient went to the IGIMS again and found history repeating itself. ""The machine through which the operation is done is not functional,"" Kumar quoted the same doctor as telling him this time. In July this year, Kumar went to the PMCH which referred him to the IGIMS. ""I have lost all hopes. The private doctor says it is high time I got operated upon. If I die, who will be responsible for my death?"" Kumar asked TOI on Friday. The doctors Kumar visited have written ""HIV+"" in bold letters on the top on his prescriptions despite the fact that the treatment protocol prohibits such ?announcements'. All that the doctors can write on such prescriptions is ?PLWHA' which stands for people living with HIV/AIDS. Kumar's is not a one-off case. Raja Singh of Chhoti Pahaari at Patna has been endlessly waiting for a heart surgery. He even visited a private hospital where the doctors told him he should go to the PMCH since his was an HIV case. He has made several rounds of the PMCH's Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology since then. Intermittently, he was referred to AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital and G B Pant Hospital (all in Delhi). Gyan Ranjan, a social activist who has been taking cudgels on behalf of the people with HIV, says he gets 30 to 40 calls from such patients every week. They are denied surgeries ranging from uterus removal to orthopaedic restoration. A patient was denied endoscopy at PMCH last year, he said. According to Ranjan, doctors at times frighten away the patients by cooking up stories. ""Two months back, a 40-yr-old woman of Chhapra went to the PMCH to get her stone problem treated. Doctors told her she would die on the operation table and she returned without treatment. Such cases are common in orthopaedic department too,"" Ranjan said. ""After the death of a woman last year, the PMCH administration promised it would allot an operation theatre for two days a week for surgery of people living with HIV. That promise has gone in vain. Doctors say they are not being provided safety kits while their hospitals deny this claim. The responsibility has not been fixed and, as such, the vicious cycle of denial goes on,"" Ranjan said.(Patients' names have been changed)"

But what if a hospital declares an HIV positive patient as negative? Suraj Prasad (name changed) went to the PMCH and complained about ulcer in glans. Neither the doctor asked nor Prasad told him that he was living with HIV. The PMCH doctor advised a number of investigations, including HIV test. The test reports were OK, including the one that declared Prasad HIV negative. The patient was not told about the outcome of test reports and given an appointment for surgery. As advised, the patient also purchased certain medicines for the purpose. It was at this time that the patient asked the PMCH doctor if he could continue with his antiretroviral therapy drugs, which are meant for persons with AIDS, post the surgery. ""Once the doctor discovered I am actually HIV positive, he asked me to leave. He said it was a complicated surgery which could lead to my death My repeated pleas fell on deaf ears,"" Prasad recalled. Undeterred, Prasad went to the PMCH again in July. ""Prior to that, I had approached the hospital superintendent and the principal secretary (health). I was finally operated upon this Sunday,"" Prasad told TOI while convalescing in the PMCH's surgery ward on Thursday."

Representing a stigmatized lot, the three women recounted how they contracted the infection, eventually losing their husbands and the trauma ? mental and social ? they had to face thereafter. ""These women not just lost their husbands, but their families too. Because of their HIV+ status, they were stigmatized and mistreated by their in-laws. Getting them to tie rakhis was just our small attempt to reach out to the section they represent,"" said Daljit Singh, a first-year student of the department. Assistant professor at the department Gaurav Gaur, who took the initiative, explained the thought behind it, ""It is an initiative to de-stigmatize people suffering from HIV/AIDS. Despite the kind of initiatives taken to dispel myths regarding the infection and the disease, people have a lot of misconceptions against such persons."" ""People visit different places to tie or get rakhis tied on their wrists. As a gesture, some women tie rakhis on the wrists of armymen. We thought that we could involve HIV+ women.

For the past three weeks, several patients claimed to have been turned away from the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Most centres have run out of stocks of Tenofovir and Lamivudine, both of which are crucial drugs prescribed in combination with a few others as the first-line HIV regimen. Tenofovir, in certain instances, is also used as a combination drug in the second-line therapy. One of the affected patients told TOI that major centres at BYL Nair and Sion hospitals too do not have these drugs. “The shortage that started with bigger centres has now hit even the smaller centers at MT Agarwal Hospital in Mulund and Siddharth Hospital in Goregaon, who too have run out of medicines for the past one week now,” he said. “Without ART medicines, most HIV patients may fall sick as their viral load will increase,” he said. Another patient said hospitals like JJ in Byculla and KEM in Parel are the only ones with some stock. “They too are giving the drugs only for a week,” he said. “There is no word from the authorities, including the Mumbai District Aids Control Society or Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) as to when the medicines will arrive,” he added. Head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that they had stocks, which should last for about a month or two. A senior official from MSACS said the shortage was caused by a delay in supply of the drug by one specific supplier. “We have got the stock on Friday and it has already been released to all the ART centers in the state. We have also provided MDACS with 21,000 tablets. Drugs should be available by Monday hopefully,” the officer said. Despite several attempts, National Aids Control Society (Naco) officials could not be reached for comments."

82,8,2014,Trangender HIV deaths rise despite drop in TN fatalities,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Trangender-HIV-deaths-rise-despite-drop-in-TN-fatalities/articleshow/40312517.cms,"CHENNAI: Has Tamil Nadu been successful in its battle against HIV/AIDS? Yes and no. The state recorded a marked decline in incidence of HIV infection and deaths from AIDS between 2009 and 2013 among both men and women. However, in what is both a pointer to the vulnerability of the third gender and an indictment of a failure in social inclusiveness, the mortality rate of HIV-positive transgenders in the state increased by more than 1,600% over the same period.READ ALSO: AIDS can be brought under control by 2030 — UNAIDS Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TNSACS) statistics, sourced by TOI through an RTI petition, show that 1,537 men and 814 women died of HIV/AIDS-related causes in 2009. Effective intervention by the state led to a decline in the numbers to 1,323 male and 595 female HIV/AIDS deaths in 2013, a fall of 18.42%. Tamil Nadu — one of the four worst HIV/AIDS affected states along with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra — recorded only seven transgender deaths in 2009. The number climbed exponentially to 113 in 2013. If this does not appear to be strikingly high number, consider that the latest census statistics put the number of transgenders in the country at 4.9 lakh out of a total population in excess of 120 crore. That is 0.04% of the general population. By comparison, the HIV/AIDS mortality rate for transgenders by population in Tamil Nadu is 5.56%. Also, activists say, the actual numbers could be far higher because transgender deaths are hugely underreported. ""Social stigma prevents the reporting of transgender deaths,"" says A J Hariharan, founder of NGO Indian Community Welfare Organisation, which works for the welfare of the sex workers and transgenders. According to the TNSACS data, the number of HIV-positive cases in the state dropped from 25,572 in 2009 to 17,055 in 2013, with the number of HIV-infected males decreasing from 14,835 to 9,868 and women from 10,665 to 7,127 over the same period. The figures raise several disconcerting questions. Have Tamil Nadu's highly acclaimed efforts to stem the spread of the disease not been an unqualified success? Is social inclusiveness a myth when it comes to transgenders despite several government initiatives to bring the community into the mainstream? Tamil Nadu was the first state to create a special welfare board for transgenders and provide them land, pension and separate ration cards. The Election Commission in 2009 created a separate entry for transgenders on voter lists. But transgenders say the welfare board has ceased to function. ""It was after Tamil Nadu that other states like Maharashtra set up welfare board for transgenders. But unfortunately the board for all purposes does not exist,"" says R Jeeva, founder of NGO Transgender Rights Association and a former member of the welfare board. Other officials say lack of awareness is probably the main cause for the rise in deaths of transgenders. ""The increase in deaths of HIV-positive transgenders is a concern. It is most likely linked to unsafe sex,"" said Dr Vijaya Raman, deputy director of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative (TAI). But transgenders say they have little choice in the matter. Latha S, a 30-year-old transgender says she's a prostitute by compulsion and not by choice. While that may be true of most women and men who sell sex for money, individuals of the third gender — stigmatised, ridiculed and shunned — have far fewer chances of opting out of the profession than others. Latha says she did not have an education and no one would give her a job. ""I have been in the profession ever since I discovered I was a transgender and joined the community,"" she says. ""Once I left home there was no one to educate me or help me get employed."" Her job, Latha says, involves violence from drunks and rowdies. ""Customers often do not pay and policemen harass us and force us to pay a large chunk of what we earn for protection,"" she says. ""I hate being a prostitute but I don't know what else to do,"" she says. What is worst, she says, is the vulnerability that she and other transgenders face and the constant fear it engenders. Transgenders usually leave home when they are around 16 years old, says A J Hariharan, the founder secretary of Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO), an NGO that works for the welfare of the homeless, sex workers and transgenders. ""They join other transgenders and are pushed into begging and prostitution,"" he says. ""Lack of basic education means they are unable to get jobs and the stigma attached to them means even manual labour is not an option."" Hariharan says companies could, as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes, look to help transgenders. ""That would be empowering for members of the community because it would involve acceptance of the fact that transgenders are part of society and bring them into the mainstream, apart from giving them a livelihood,"" he says. But the discrimination that transgenders face leaves them with little optimism that they could win acceptance and integrate with society. ""Social acceptance? I don't know if that is possible,"" says transgender Raji Sekar, 25. ""We can't even take a house on rent because few landlords would want transgenders as tenants."" ""I did not wish to be transgender,"" she says. ""I was born this way and that is what people should realise for society to accept us,"" she says. Her companion Ambika M, has bruises on her face and hands. She says a group of men beat her up a few days ago. ""We face intolerance all the time, so nobody cares about our safety,"" she says. ""Not a day goes by without a transgender being beaten up by customers or drunkards."" "

The Goa medical council’s ethics and disciplinary committee—heeding the state commission for protection of child rights’ complaint against Dr Auvduth Prabhudessai—has concluded that since the doctor is not registered with the council it has no jurisdiction in the case. The commission’s chairperson Samira Kazi said the department is exploring other possibilities of taking action against Prabhudessai. 	When contacted by STOI, Prabhudessai refused to reveal what he had advised the villagers, saying only, “I’m responsible for the welfare of my village.” Asked if he had misinformed locals about HIV/AIDS, he said he would reply only to an inquiry against him. 	Chief minister Manohar Parrikar recently assured the legislative assembly that action would be taken against the doctor, after Sanguem MLA Subhash Faldessai raised the issue in the House. 	Before his retirement, Prabhudessai worked for the directorate of health services and also served in the armed forces. Post retirement he runs a private practice at Colomb, Rivona. Asked if he is open to the idea of children with HIV being given admissions in regular schools, Prabhudessai said, “It is a debatable issue.” He refused to elaborate, saying he did not want to answer such questions telephonically. 	He informed STOI that he was registered with the Maharashtra Medical Council after getting his degree, as the Goa council did not exist then, and later he did register with the Goa council. It is mandatory for every doctor to register with the state medical council or MCI if they want to practice in India. It is also compulsory for doctors to renew this registration every five years. 	The controversy over admissions to HIV-positive children raged for over a fortnight in June-July, and was finally resolved through government intervention. It saw over 40 parents withdraw their wards from the school where the children with HIV were finally admitted. "

Researchers at the University of Washington (UW) have developed the material which is capable of carrying substantial loads of medicine, dissolving and releasing the drugs once its comes into contact with moisture. The study builds on research conducted at UW's Department of Bioengineering in 2012. Dr Kim Woodrow and her team were experimenting with electrospinning, a process where a charged fluid containing polymers and antiretroviral drugs is projected from a syringe and through an electric field. The electric field causes the jet of liquid to break into tiny fibres, each measuring anywhere between 100 to several thousand nanometres, 'Gizmag' reported. These then come to land on a collecting plate and combine to form a stretchy fabric capable of blocking sperm and, as the researchers discovered, carrying and releasing contraceptives and antivirals. Because certain elements of the material can be controlled, such as the solubility, strength and size of the fibres, the researchers said that it may prove more versatile than other anti-HIV technologies currently in development. One sample dissolved within minutes, an application that could protect against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Another sample dissolved over several days, which could prove useful in sustained delivery of drugs, such as birth-control pills and anti-HIV medicines. The team said that the electrospun material can carry a large load of maraviroc, an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV which has minimal side effects. The research is published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. "

According to recent data from the Union ministry of health and family welfare, 1,330 pregnant women of the nearly seven lakh carrying mothers screened in AP last year, tested HIV positive. The ministry data shows that in neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, where a larger number of women were screened, the percentage of women testing positive was significantly lower. It has been estimated that a mother has 30 per cent chance of transmitting the virus to her baby during pregnancy. The mortality rate among children with HIV is much higher compared to adults owing to their under-developed immune systems. However AP fared better or equally well in treating mothers to prevent transmission to children, as evinced by the data which shows that 1,142 HIV positive pregnant women were put on treatment. To reduce the numbers of baby transmissions, AP government in a first launched a new regimen of medication and treatment modality in 2012. The new treatment modality requires mothers to start treatment 14 weeks into pregnancy as against earlier practice of taking medication at the time of delivery. The medication now comprises a combination of three drugs as against one compound that was given earlier. Babies now are also given the same medication after birth. Additionally, under the new treatment practice, babies are screened every six months after birth until 18 months of age, when a concluding diagnosis is made about their infection. According to P L Jayachandra Reddy, additional project director of AP State Aids Control Society, more than 90 per cent of the first batch of pregnant women in undivided AP, who were put on the new treatment modality in 2012, delivered babies without infecting them. “The transmission rate has come down to about five per cent. It has not been eliminated completely owing to drug resistance some of the women developed during treatment or due to delay in starting the treatment,” Reddy said. A team comprising members of World Health Organisation (WHO) and National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) established this during a study of AP’s implementation of the new treatment modality in March this year, 18 months after the first batch of women mentioned by Reddy, gave birth. Buoyed by AP’s success, the WHO-NACO team has recommended that the new treatment modality be taken up in other states.

According to P L Jayachandra Reddy, additional project director of AP State Aids Control Society, more than 90 per cent of the first batch of pregnant women in undivided AP, who were put on the new treatment modality in 2012, delivered babies without infecting them. “The transmission rate has come down to about five per cent. It has not been eliminated completely owing to drug resistance some of the women developed during treatment or due to delay in starting the treatment,” Reddy said. A team comprising members of World Health Organisation (WHO) and National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) established this during a study of AP’s implementation of the new treatment modality in March this year, 18 months after the first batch of women mentioned by Reddy, gave birth. Buoyed by AP’s success, the WHO-NACO team has recommended that the new treatment modality be taken up in other states. The data was released by Union ministry of health 1,330 pregnant women of the nearly seven lakh carrying mothers screened in undivided Andhra Pradesh last year, tested HIV positive, which is much higher than in other states "

This, despite the fact Chhattisgarh is among one of 13 states that account for 90% of HIV infected pregnant women in India. Union health ministry had fixed deadline of April 2014 for implementation of its programme, Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV (PPTCT) services, in all government run hospitals and health centres in the 12 affected districts of Chhattisgarh. However, four months after lapse of the deadline, PPTCT services are yet to start in health centres of the state. Even multi-drug regimen for preventing transmission of the disease from infected mother to foetus, which was to start in these health centres, has failed to take off. According to NACO’s data there are an estimated 38,204 HIV infected pregnant women across the country. Of these, 90% (34,465) are concentrated in 13 states including Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. In Chhattisgarh, 233 such cases were detected in 2013-14. According to NACO officials 12 districts in Chhattisgarh – namely Raipur, Bilaspur, Dhamtari, Durg, Mahasamund, Rajnandgaon, Janjgir-Champa, Korba, Koriya, Raigarh, Bastar and Surguja- have been identified as priority areas for scaling up HIV-testing services to ensure timely detection of infected mothers. Dr SK Binjhwar, additional project director, State AIDS Control Society admitted delay in implementing of services in all community and primary health centres. He attributed this to delay in receiving grants for purchase of HIV testing kits. He said HIV testing services in all CHCs and PHCs is expected to commence by next month. He also disclosed that 4,500 auxillary nursing and midwifery (ANM) have been trained for screening of pregnant women for HIV. A recent NACO report on multi-drug anti-retro virals for PPTCT of HIV under National AIDS Control Programme in India, an estimated 1,097 HIV infected pregnant woman require PPTCT services in Chhattisgarh. As per the report 159 pregnant women were detected with HIV 2012-13. NACO officials said efforts are on to make HIV testing of all pregnant women mandatory in government hospitals. They admitted though consent of expecting mothers is required for a HIV test, they would counsel reluctant ones to ensure their participation. Officials said if a pregnant woman is tested positive, efforts are made to reduce chances of transmission of HIV to her child by giving Navirapine Prophylaxis. A dose of navirapine is given to mother at the time of delivery to prevent HIV transmission to child. According to NACO report, while 100% medical colleges and district hospitals have an HIV testing facility across the country, about 86% sub-district hospitals have the same. But lower down in the health system the levels of saturation differ in different phases. "

So, the hospital provided her regular care and medicines. Now, weeks before the delivery date, she is in fear that the mistake by the hospital may end up affecting the baby she is expecting. Along with her husband, Asha (name changed), a Gurgaon resident from a semi-rural background, was detected HIV positive in 2011 by Civil Hospital. This year, the couple decided to have a child. After conceiving, in March, Asha visited Civil Hospital again. The hospital again put her through an HIV test, which is mandatory under Haryana government rules on all pregnant women. The 2011 report fell between the cracks. But this new report a copy of which is with TOI showed she was HIV negative. Asha proceeded to follow doctors' instructions, assuming they were aware of her HIV positive condition as those tests had been conducted in the same hospital, without noticing that this time, the results were different. Earlier this month, when she visited a gynaecologist at Civil Hospital for a check-up, Asha told her she was HIV positive. The gynaecologist immediately got another test done at the hospital. This time, the result was positive. The lab staff made a new report on August 19. The hospital, subsequently, referred the case to a Delhi hospital. ""We'll first have to figure out why she was referred to a new hospital. We're carrying out investigations. Action will be taken if lab reports were found to be false,"" said CMO Pushpa Bishnoi. Asked about the impact of the faulty report on the baby, a city-based gynecologist said, ""Although it depends on the viral load in her body, since in this case both husband and wife are infected, she (Asha) should have been given anti-virus therapy from the beginning."""
90,8,2014,Stock-out hits HIV treatment across India,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Stock-out-hits-HIV-treatment-across-India/articleshow/40886596.cms,"MUMBAI: Treatment for HIV patients across India has taken a hit, especially in Delhi and Mumbai, due to severe stock-outs of life-saving medicines reported at government-owned centres. Shortage of first-line (initial), second-line (advanced) and paediatric HIV drugs, besides crucial diagnostic kits, has prompted patient groups to send a legal notice to the government, pointing to the scarcity, gaps in procurement and supply of these drugs. The treatment and control of HIV, including dispensing drugs and testing, is handled by the government-run public health programme through its 355-odd centres. Of the over two million HIV-infected people in India, four states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu — account for 53%. More than one-third of them, or 7.5 lakh patients, are on the public health programme this year. While the medicines are available in the retail market at a cost, the ones dispensed at government-owned centres come free. At certain centres in Mumbai and Delhi, partial doses of treatment are being provided to patients for a few days, forcing them to return frequently. Alternatively, drugs are being substituted. Hospitals such as AIIMS, Safdarjung and LNJP in Delhi, and Nair, KEM, Siddharth and Sion in Mumbai have been grappling with shortage of these drugs. Prices of first-line HIV drugs in the retail market has come down now substantially due to affordable generic medicines. The treatment costs lakhs of rupees for advanced therapies for certain patients. While, retail first-line drugs cost Rs 5,500 a year, the advanced and complex therapies come at around Rs 20,000 to Rs 2 lakh a year. In a legal notice to the health ministry sent on August 22, the Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+), representing HIV patients, has sought emergency procurement and relocation of stocks to government-owned centres experiencing stock-outs of ARVS, particularly in Mumbai. They have also sought strengthening and streamlining drug forecasting, procurement and supply chain mechanism to prevent future shortages. Stock-outs have hit centres in Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Manipur the worst, Vikas Ahuja of International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, South Asia, told TOI. Drug supply has been erratic over the past few months, Ahuja said. Bureaucratic delay in tendering, procurement and supply has been cited as the reason, besides the mechanism not being planned proactively and in a streamlined way. As per NACO guidelines, patients adhering to the treatment should get the medicines for at least a month. Industry experts say shortage of second-line therapy has existed in certain centres since 2012, and that of diagnostic kits since last year."
91,8,2014,"Proteins that inhibit HIV, Ebola release identified",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Proteins-that-inhibit-HIV-Ebola-release-identified/articleshow/40911485.cms," WASHINGTON: In a surprise finding, scientists have discovered that a family of proteins that helps viruses, such as HIV and Ebola, enter a cell can also block the release of these deadly viruses. 	""This is a surprising finding that provides new insights into our understanding of not only HIV infection, but also that of Ebola and other viruses,"" said Shan-Lu Liu, associate professor in the University of Missouri School of Medicine's Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology. 	AIDS is a condition characterised by progressive failure of the immune system. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). 	When HIV-1 or any virus infects a cell, it replicates and spreads to other cells. One type of cellular protein - T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain, or TIM-1 - has previously been shown to promote entry of some highly pathogenic viruses into host cells. 	Now, researchers have found that the same protein possesses a unique ability to block the release of HIV-1 and Ebola virus. 	""This study shows that TIM proteins keep viral particles from being released by the infected cell and instead keep them tethered to the cell surface,"" said Gordon Freeman, associate professor of medicine with Harvard Medical School's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 	""This is true for several important enveloped viruses including HIV and Ebola. We may be able to use this insight to slow the production of these viruses,"" said Freeman. 	Under the supervision of Liu, Minghua Li, a graduate student in the MU Pathobiology Area Programme, performed a series of experiments that revealed the protein's ability to inhibit HIV-1 release, resulting in diminished viral production and replication. 	HIV-1 attacks cells that are vital to the body's immune system, such as T cells. These white blood cells play an important role in the body's response to infection, but HIV-1 disrupts the cells' ability to fight back against infection. 	When the virus enters a host cell, it infects the cell and replicates, producing viral particles that spread to and infect other cells. 	The researchers found that as the viral particles attempt to bud from, or leave, the infected cell, the TIM-family proteins located on the surface of the cell can attach to lipids on the surface of the viral particle. 	These lipids - known as phosphatidylserine (PS) - are normally present on the inner side of the cellular membrane but can be exposed to the outer side upon viral infection. 	When the TIM-family proteins come in contact with PS, the viral particle becomes attached to the host cell, keeping the particle from being released from the cell. 	Because TIM-family proteins and PS are present on the surface of the cell and the viral particle, the viral particles get stuck to one another, forming a network of viral particles that accumulate on the surface of the host cell, rather than being released to infect other cells. 	The study was published in the journal PNAS. "

The couple's sorry plight came to light on Monday, when Naik and his wife, of Bhairagada village located about 70 km from the district headquarters town of Rayagada under Muniguda block, met collector Sashi Bhushan Padhi at his grievance cell and told him about their experience. The couple were diagnosed HIV positive in 2012 when their blood samples were examined during the woman's pregnancy. ""On the advice of doctors, we immediately started taking medicines and my wife delivered a son at Koraput hospital. By the grace of God, our son is not affected by HIV,"" said Naik.

The battered couple went to police, who helped them return to their home. There is now a police picket in the locality in Ghola. But the stigma of social ostracism in an area barely 30km from the city centre is a grim pointer to the taboo that still surrounds the disease. Fortunately, some neighbours have come forward to support them. The couple has a six-year-old daughter, who is not HIV-positive. They were making preparations to secure her life when their own blood relatives and one-time friends turned on them. The husband, a small-time trader, is 35 years old and his wife 32. She was the first to be detected with HIV during a routine test during her pregnancy in 2006. Her husband was also asked to undergo the test and he, too, tested positive. After the initial shock, they took it bravely and went through the entire process of medication and counseling. They decided to keep their condition under the wraps when doctors told them that they could lead a normal life under medication and care. “The doctor who is treating us advised us of the precautions to take to prevent transmission. We have a daughter who is not infected. We have to take precautions to prevent the disease from spreading to her. The doctor also told us to start saving for antiretroviral therapy,” the wife told TOI. A few days ago, her husband’s younger brother stumbled upon their secret. He lives in the same house with his wife and two children. As soon as he came to know that his brother and sister-in-law were HIV-positive, he made life miserable for them. According to the couple, he kept demanding that they leave the house because they were putting him and his family at risk. “No amount of reasoning would convince him that we were taking all the necessary precautions since we also have a child. He and his wife would abuse and even physically assault us. Finally, on Saturday afternoon, my brother-in-law summoned a few locals who are known to him. After my husband returned from work, they caught hold of him and threw him out of the house. When I rushed to his rescue, one of them hit me on the head with a stick and I started bleeding,” she added. Outnumbered and getting no assistance from locals, the couple and their daughter went to the police and narrated their trauma. Officers immediately sent a team to escort them back to the locality. “The couple says they are HIV-positive and that they were beaten up by the husband’s brother. We have taken down their complaint. We will take strong action against the accused,” said Barrackpore detective chief C Sudhakar. When a police contingent accompanied the couple back to their house, the accused were nowhere to be found. After ensuring that the couple was safely in their house, police left a stern message with locals not to bother them in the future. Police are looking for the man’s brother and his associates involved in the attack. Sources say he has fled the area with his family. "

The medicine is not available either in the market or government run Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) medicine.

""After the news (about penalty) was published, one of the community members came to him and returned Rs 56,000.

However, Dilip doesn't mind losing the remaining money as he had got the cash by selling his wife's ornaments. Dilip's wife, who too was an AIDS patient for the last seven years, had committed suicide on September 2. However, instead of standing by him in this difficult time, Prajapati's community slapped a fine of Rs 1.11 lakh on him. Prajapati, who earns Rs 150 a day by working as a labourer at a food eatery, was forced to borrow money and sell ornaments of his wife to pay the fine. ""I would now repay the lenders,"" said Dilip.

A total of 118 teachers were trained in these workshops. With a gain in Pre test- Post Test Scores by 34% they are now trained trainers under the GFATM Project. 	The goal of these trainings was, to provide basic information on HIV AIDS &amp; antiretroviral therapy (ART) to the teachers of all ANM Nursing Training Schools of Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh &amp; Punjab so that they impart the same training to their ANM students (future Auxiliary Nurses) hence enabling them to adequately support, care &amp; treat their patients who are HIV Positive. 	This course has been designed for ANMs working in Primary/ Community Health Centres/ ICTC/ FICTCs. The teachers have been trained about Basics of HIV/AIDS, Stigma &amp; Discrimination, and Counselling &amp; Testing for HIV, and Prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT), Infection control &amp; Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), Sexually Transmitted Infections in HIV. 	The lectures were followed by group works such as role plays, presentations and discussions.

According to officials, five ART centres that provide the drug free to HIV positive patients across the state have no stock of nevirapine syrup and tablets and some other medicines too could soon run out since no fresh stocks are coming in. Chhattisgarh Network for People Living with HIV said the shortage had exposed many to risks of the disease. 	Doctors revealed that pregnant women are supposed to receive a single dose of the drug at the time of labour and their newborn babies get a single dose of the drug syrup immediately after birth. ""Many babies in the state have missed this required dose, said president of Chhattisgarh Network of Positive People (CNPP), Rinki Arora. 	She said however, medicines- Tenofovir-lamivudine combination, which is prescribed to adults, and a lopinavir-ritonavir combination syrup that is given to children are available for next two months. However, they are apprehensive of yet another crises building up as it's already happened five times this year that stocks had run out. 	Talking to TOI, Rinki said she was in Delhi just to discuss the treatment strategy, as ART centres would soon be going out of stock of many medicines including tenofovir-lamivudine and lopinavir-ritonavir"". She said this is the big issue as drugs are necessary for the health of the mother and child. 	Secretary of CNPP, K Mukesh, said recently around 15 deliveries in Durg, 11 in Raipur and four in Bilaspur were conducted without the newborns being given the mandatory dose of nevirapine. He said the cost of one bottle is around Rs 1,200 and the dose is given according to weight but due to its cost, people don't buy it. He said that as per new guidelines of NACO, the drug is required to administer to newborns within six months. 	When contacted, additional project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, said there is shortage of nevirapine syrup but we can't do anything about it as only one company manufactures the same and there is no supply from it. According to officials, around 17,000 HIV patients including 2,500 children are registered at ART centres in the state. "

The prevalence of the virus among sex workers in brothels is higher than street-based and home-based sex workers, according to an RSCACS report. Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society's (RSACS) state report released recently shows that one out of 71 street-based sex workers and one out of 208 home-based sex workers are living with HIV. ""HIV prevalence varied depending upon type of sex work. Higher prevalence of 3.25% has been found among brothel-based sex workers followed by 1.4% among street-based and 0.48% in home-based sex workers,"" according to the report. The report elaborates that HIV prevalence varies among female sex workers (FSW) on the time they had spent in the work. ""Considering the duration of sex work, highest positivity has been recorded among those who are in the profession of sex work for around 3 to 5 years. During the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2008, the highest positivity of 6.25% was seen among new entrants (i.e. six months to one year of sex work). In HSS 2010-11, among new entrants, the HIV prevalence is only 1.67% which is reduced by 5.58% as compared to HSS 2008,"" the report says. The HIV positivity among sex workers with one to six years in the profession is 1.67%, among those with one to 3 years is 0.38%, those with 3-5 years have highest prevalence of 2.39% and with more than 5 years in profession, such workers have 1.36% of prevalence. RSACS officials claimed that the HIV prevalence among sex workers have declined over the past few years. ""Result of the HSS 2010-11 shows that the overall HIV prevalence amongst female sex workers is 1.28%, a significant decrease of 2.53% from 2008. Three consistent sites Ajmer, Alwar and Banswara showed significant decrease in prevalence,"" the report says. The result of HSS 2010-11 shows that highest HIV prevalence rates among FSWs have been recorded in eastern and southern parts of the state. ""Nearly one out of 20 female sex workers are living with HIV in Alwar, while Udaipur and Ajmer have almost one out 100 sex workers with HIV, Ganganagar has one out of 200 sex workers with HIV,"" the report says. Alwar has higher prevalence as the work is brothel based. An RSACS official said the prevalence among the sex workers is on the decline because they are more aware of precautions and also the officials are conducting individual tracking to prevent HIV infections among FSWs. While comparing prevalence between rural and urban areas, it has been found in HSS 2010 data that prevalence rate is higher in rural areas (1.95%) as compared to urban areas (0.57%). ""A scrutiny of higher vulnerability to HIV rendering to the characteristics of the population marks that women who have certain education are more informed, and thus better able to protect themselves from HIV. This was observed in HSS 2010 data where educated female sex workers comprised a lower proportion (1.01%) of the total number of HIV positive than their illiterate counterparts,"" the report says. Moreover, the positivity is on the decline among young female sex workers aged 20-29 years. It was 4.24% in 2008 compared to 1.78% in 2010-2011, a decline of 2.46%."

The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) said it is withdrawing “with immediate effect” — a guideline that had allowed it to put price caps on crucial medicines — to comply with a government “direction”. The guideline had been issued on May 29, just three days after the Modi government was sworn in. Although the NPPA’s sudden notification does not mention whether it is revoking the price caps which it had announced on 50 anti-diabetic and cardiac drugs in July, the development could have negative fallout, sources said. A wider and more serious impact will be that impending price controls on expensive treatments of cancer, HIV and tuberculosis now stand cancelled.READ ALSO: Stock-out hits HIV treatment across India NPPA officials were not available for comment, but sources say the government succumbed to pressure from industry lobbies. The NPPA’s decision to impose price controls had been hotly contested; with the industry up in arms against what it said was “arbitrary implementation of the policy”. In effect, NPPA has withdrawn guidelines for price control issued under Para 19 of the Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO) 2013, which authorized it to control prices of drugs that are not under the NLEM (National List of Essential Medicines) under “extraordinary circumstances” and in “public interest”. In July the NPPA, in a rare invocation of the lesser-used provision, had fixed prices of 50 anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medicines. This was the first time the government had brought drugs, outside the national list of essential medicines, under price control. (Prices of 652 drugs under NLEM were fixed by the government last year under DPCO 2013). The move had triggered of a series of protests and lawsuits from the industry against the drug pricing regulator as they feared more such action. “In compliance with the directions received from the government in the department of pharmaceuticals ... The aforesaid internal guidelines issued by the NPPA on May 29, 2014 under Paragraph 19 of DPCO 2013 are hereby withdrawn with immediate effect,” NPPA said in its latest notification posted on its website. The industry welcomed the move saying that the interpretation of the May guidelines was erroneous. “We have always contended that the guidelines for Para 19 were erroneous. Para 19 is not the right provision for extension of price control as there is no public health concern which could have prompted the NPPA to invoke the provision,” D G Shah, secretary general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said. Though it is still trying to figure out its implication on companies, the industry body representing multinational firms, the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, said: “We appreciate the government’s decision to withdraw the guidelines on fixation/revision of prices of scheduled and non-scheduled formulations under Para 19 of the DPCO 2013. This welcome move tells us we are being heard and we look forward to working with the government toward a common goal.” The industry expects that the NPPA will take a decision on whether to revoke the price reduction order, over the next few days. The next hearing of the OPPI court case against NPPA is slated for September 29. "

Habra’s Leena Das (name changed) said, “My husband died in January this year nine months after he was detected with full blow AIDS. My two sons and I are also HIV positive. My children are too young to understand the implications of the virus. Like other kids they were looking forward for new clothes, which I was unable to afford. I am so touched by the gesture of these sisters.” Leena works as a tailor and her income is inadequate to take care of her family. These HIV positive children are under the North 24-Parganas Network for People living with HIV/AIDS, Barasat (NNP+), who facilitates their health check-ups, treatment and other support. Majority of these children got infected from their parents while few are thalassemic and got the virus during blood transfusions. Most are orphans as their parents have succumbed to AIDS. “There are about 400 children under NNP+, many of whom have lost their parents to AIDS. Their families do not want to keep them due to the stigma. And so far there is no shelter home for these children from the government. But this effort by the staff and students of the nursing college is a reason to cheer for these children,” said Samir Biswas of NNP + Barasat. The ‘joy of giving’ campaign also provided the nursing students with an opportunity to interact with HIV positive individuals. Principal Dr Subrata Sarkar hugged the children, shook hands and mixed with them, sending a message to students that HIV positive individuals are not to be shunned. “There is still so much of stigma attached with HIV positives. Such interaction, apart from giving the HIV positive kids a little bit of joy during the festival, is also a platform where we make an effort to change the attitude of the future nurses about these patients,” said Sarkar. This is the third year the college has organized the ‘joy of giving’. The staff and students pooled in for the project. The students also put up a show for the children."

Awarding the meagre compensation, the Madras high court on Thursday asked parents of the boy, now 16, to file a separate suit if they wanted a higher amount. S Sorna, a daily wager, had moved the Madras high court HC, seeking a compensation of Rs 10 lakh. She said doctors at the Institute of Child Health in Egmore transmitted HIV-infected blood to her son Kumar (name changed) in February 1999 after a surgery. The one-year-old boy had been was admitted to the hospital for treatment of diarrhoea. The boy was treated as an inpatient till March 1999 and then discharged. However, he started falling ill frequently in September 1999 and developed cold and swelling on his neck. Medical tests revealed that he was HIV-positive. The parents themselves underwent a series of tests, and it was found that they were not infected. Sorna then realized that the government hospital had transfused blood without a prior test. She demanded Rs 10 lakh as compensation for her son's present condition and future treatment. The hospital, however, denied the allegations saying while the surgery and blood transfusion was done in February, the boy fell ill and tested positive for HIV only in September 1999. Infection might have happened at any other hospital where the boy was treated during this period, it said. Rejecting the contention, Justice S Vaidyanathan said the parents were poor and that they could not afford to take treatment in private hospitals. By invoking public law remedy, he awarded Rs 50,000 as compensation and added that the child or his parents could invoke their private law remedy by filing a suit for tortuous damages. ""Since the hospital is disputing the case of the petitioner, contending that there is no negligence on its part, this court is of the view that the petitioner can work out her remedy by way of a suit before an appropriate civil court,"" he said. Taking note of the present health condition of the boy, ""which is deteriorating day by day"", the judge directed the authorities to take necessary steps and provide better treatment to him free of cost and extend all relief packages provided by the state government for victims of AIDS.

109,10,2014,"Encouraged by declining HIV cases, GSACS steps up efforts",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Encouraged-by-declining-HIV-cases-GSACS-steps-up-efforts/articleshow/44022981.cms,"Panaji: Though statistics provided by the Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) depict a gradual decline in the number of HIV and AIDS cases in Goa over the last five years, GSACS has stepped up its efforts to reduce the number HIV/AIDS cases in the state even further. Last year, 532 cases of HIV were registered in the state compared to 959 cases in 2009. A similar trend has been observed among AIDS patients with only 51 cases registered in 2013 compared to 184 cases registered in 2009. A total of 1,040 persons have succumbed to the deadly virus since 1989, when HIV was first detected in Goa. But, this is only the reported figure, while the actual number would be higher as HIV-related deaths at home or private hospitals are not reflected in the above figures. GSACS project director Dr Vandana Patankar said that they have increased the number of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres in Goa. Earlier, there was only one main ART centre at the Goa medical college, Bambolim; but, in recent years, GSACS has set up link ART centres at Asilo hospital, Mapusa, Hospicio hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and cottage hospital, Chicalim. Patankar revealed plans of upgrading the link ART centre at the Hospicio, Margao, to facility-integrated ART centre. This means that there will be a doctor and nurse at the centre and patients from South Goa need not travel to GMC for the initial CD4 test. He also mentioned of another link ART centre that has been approved for the Curchorem community health centre. GSACS has tied up with nine NGOs to execute 16 projects in Goa to combat HIV/AIDS. These NGOs work with high risk groups like commercial sex workers, drug users, gay men, truckers, etc. GSACS is now adding two more projects with the focus on migrants. Another new measure is towards HIV positive pregnant women. Earlier, these women were treated only at the time of delivery. Now, such cases will be provided life-long ART treatment and the child will be given treatment for at least six months depending on whether it is HIV positive or negative. “Presently, the mother to child HIV transmission percentage is about 2.5%. We want to make it zero,” Patankar said. He also informed of another new initiative of setting up a new opiad substitution therapy centre at Hospicio, Margao. This centre is meant to wean drug addicts who use injections from syringes to oral drugs which are less addictive. Presently, there is only one such centre at Calangute which is run by an NGO. GSACS is also adding one more ICTC (integrated counselling and testing centres) at Ponda. It already has 14 such centres all over Goa including three especially for expectant mothers. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sanctioned 7.55 crore for GSACS to conduct its programmes this year, but the amount is yet to be released, Patankar added."
110,10,2014,"After over 30 years, exact location of HIV’s first appearance pinpointed by scientists",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/After-over-30-years-exact-location-of-HIVs-first-appearance-pinpointed-by-scientists/articleshow/44190657.cms,"LONDON: Over 30 years after it first emerged and has since infected over 75 million people, scientists have finally pinpointed from where exactly HIV emerged. A genetic analysis of thousands of individual viruses has confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that HIV first emerged in Kinshasa, the capital of the Belgian Congo, in about 1920 from where it spread thanks to the colonial railway network to other parts of central Africa. Scientists have nailed the origin of the Aids pandemic to a colonial-era city — then called Leopoldville which was then the biggest urban centre in Central Africa including a market in wild “bush meat” captured from the nearby forests. A “perfect storm” of factors then led to the virus’ spread in the human population. UNAIDS estimates that 35 million people were living with HIV in the world at the end of 2013. Scientists from University of Oxford said, “Thirty years after the discovery of HIV-1, the early transmission, dissemination and establishment of the virus in human populations remain unclear. Using statistical approaches applied to HIV-1 sequence data from central Africa, we show that from the 1920s Kinshasa (in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo) was the focus of early transmission and the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses elsewhere. Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa. Our results reconstruct the early dynamics of HIV-1 and emphasize the role of social changes and transport networks in the establishment of this virus in human populations.”Vendors sell their products beside a railroad track in Kinshasa, Zaire (File photo via Getty Images) The breakthrough was possible due to a new, sophisticated analysis of hundreds of genetic sequences of HIV from different time points and locations. The researchers also note that 13 documented cases exist of different simian viruses jumping from chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys into humans, but only one — known has HIV-1 group M — sparked a global epidemic. They show that group M and another strain, group O, expanded at the same rate until about 1960, but then group M nearly tripled its rate of spread. Possible reasons include public health campaigns that had contaminated needles and an increase in the number of clients of sex workers. “For the first time we have analysed all the available evidence using the latest phylogeographic techniques, which enable us to statistically estimate where a virus comes from,” said Professor Oliver Pybus of Oxford University. “This means we can say with a high degree of certainty where and when the HIV pandemic originated.” “Kinshasa at that time was growing fast, it was the biggest city in central Africa at that time and was very well connected to the rest of the Congo,” said Nuno Faria of Oxford. “Data from colonial archives tells us that by the end of the 1940s over one million people were travelling through Kinshasa on the railways each year. Our genetic data tells us that HIV very quickly spread across Congo, a country the size of Western Europe,” Dr Faria said. “Our research suggests that following the original animal-to-human transmission of the virus, probably through the hunting or handling of bush meat, there was only a small window during the Belgian colonial era for this particular strain of HIV to emerge and spread into a pandemic,” Professor Pybus said. “By the 1960s, transport systems such as the railways that enabled the virus to spread vast distances were less active, but by that time the seeds of the pandemic were already sown across Africa and beyond,” he said.

The slack supply could lead to there being no stocks left which could make HIV positive people very vulnerable to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drug resistance as well, according to activists working with HIV positive people. The region has the highest number of HIV positive people and intravenous drug users in the country. According to the department of AIDS control (2013-2014) and as per NACO HIV estimates, the total number of new infected adults was 6,460 and there were 3,594 AIDS related deaths in the northeast region. Organizations working with HIV positive people said that depleting stocks in medicines such as Nevirapine, combined dosages of Tenofovor and Lamivudine, and Abacavir have rendered a section of the adult HIV positive people in some places to use medicines meant for children who are HIV positive. In Manipur, which is considered to have the highest number of HIV positive people in the country (40,855 in March 2012), Nevirapine is almost out of stock, sources said. A 200 mg dose of Nevirapine is taken twice a day by a HIV positive person. With diminishing stocks, patients were reported to be taking Nevirapine 50 mg four times in the morning and four times in the evening. “We cannot live without these drugs. The situation has been going on for a while. We are dependent on these medicines and a timely duration during the present course of the drug regimen keeps our health in check. Authorities should take necessary steps,” said Rajkumar Kanta, president of Community Network for Empowerment (CONE). Besides the shortage, slow dispatch in medicines on the part of courier services has also caused problems. An emergency dispatch of Nevirapine for Manipur took 28 days to reach the destination. The dispatch was lying idle for 19 days in Guwahati, sources said. “I took a tracking slip from one courier company for tracking Nevirapine. It revealed that from Hyderabad to Guwahati, it took 28 days. It also showed that the stocks were lying idle in Guwahati for 19 days. This is ridiculous and totally unacceptable. Among the numerous bottlenecks, this courier service is one major hurdle,” said Loon Gangte of International Treatment Preparedness and Coalition. In Dimapur district of Nagaland, the Nevirapine paediatric drug is out of stock at ART centres. The same drug is available in Mokokching district but its availability could diminish in two to three weeks. In Mizoram, Nevarapine syrup, which is given to newborns, was also reported to be out of stock. In Assam, activists said there is a shortage of Nevirapine syrup and Tenofovir and Lamivudine fixed dose combination."
112,10,2014,ASRO nuns shower love on HIV positive kids,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ASRO-nuns-shower-love-on-HIV-positive-kids/articleshow/44528023.cms,"PANAJI: To the unknowing, they are bright, young kids playing in their boarding house yard. Their greetings are spontaneous and warm, their faces appear cheerful but all 42 children of ASRO at Tivim are HIV positive. Most are orphans but all are victims, in some form or the other, of discrimination and rejection. The love and care they now thrive on comes from the nuns of the Sisters of Mercy of the Holy Cross. Three nuns manage ASRO - the home for HIV positive children – which is a project of Caritas Goa. The home began with one HIV positive child in a residential house at Canca, Tivim, in 2002. That child died four years ago, the home is now a big building closer to Acoi and presently, there are 20 girls and 22 boys living there. Except for seven, all are on anti-retroviral treatment from the Goa medical college. Most of the children are migrants but there are a few Goans from the Vasco area. ASRO takes in children of all creeds and most are non-Christians, except five. “There is a sad story behind every child here,” says Sr Coshav Rodrigues, in-charge of the home. “It is not their fault that they are HIV positive. Almost all of them got it from their parents.” But forget society, even family can be unforgiving. There is one 14-year-old girl from a well-to-do family, who lost both her parents to HIV/AIDS. When other family members realized she too was positive, they admitted her to ASRO. Once they took her home on a festival day but would not allow their daughter to play with her. When they returned the child to ASRO later in the evening, the child was in tears. And resolutely silent. With Sr Coshav’s gentle probing, the child opened up. The nun later counselled the family which relented and now take the child home for three or four days sometimes. “There is lot of misinformation among people. But they realize there is no danger when we tell them that we live with these children 24-hours in a day. We want to integrate them in society but the children live with rejection. Some express their hurt,” says Sr Felcy Lewis, who is also the resident nurse at the home. The oldest boy is 22-years old. He was admitted when he was around nine. He could not cope with studies and now works at the home. Except for the occasional cold, cough and fever, he keeps fairly good health. The youngest child is four years old who was admitted in June this year. She too is quite healthy. All children are taken for health check-ups to the GMC every month. But every six months, the children undergo blood tests at the GMC. In the last four years, only one child died at the home. Though the project is run by Caritas Goa, people donate generously in kind by giving rice, dal, coconut, sugar, milk, biscuits and bakery products. Occasionally, the home also gets chicken and fish. Waking up in the middle of the night to tend to a sick child is routine for the three nuns. But the boys and girls living under the same roof though in different quarters, are growing up. Naturally, there is the occasional display of affection. The nuns have to now cope with the possibility of the blossoming of love between the children. It’s a challenge they are seeking to address the only way they know, with love."
113,10,2014,"HIV relief for only 52 orphans, destitute kids",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/HIV-relief-for-only-52-orphans-destitute-kids/articleshow/44819643.cms," 	NEW DELHI: Just 52 orphans and destitute children have got the benefit of the only financial assistance scheme Delhi government offers to people living with HIV/AIDS. In a status report on children impacted by HIV/AIDS, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has questioned the complex eligibility criteria for the scheme launched in fiscal 2012-13. 	A 2012 study by Delhi State AIDS Control Society estimates the number of orphans and vulnerable children in Delhi as 1,908, of whom 766 were infected with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, there were 1,142 children whose parents were infected with the virus. The data used in the DCPCR study was gathered during the period April 2010-March 2012 from nine antiretroviral treatment centres, Children Affected by AIDS (CABA) pilot scheme and two institutions providing residential care to CABA in Delhi. 	The DCPCR study finds the coverage of the Financial Assistance Scheme for People Living with HIV/AIDS ((PLHA) of Delhi Government wanting in many ways. The scheme has so far enrolled 1,726 infected adults and children,14 orphan children who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, 26 orphaned HIV-positive children and 12 HIV-positive destitute children. 	A sum of Rs 1,000 is given as monthly benefit to PLHAs including infected children, Rs 1,750 to orphaned children who are not positive but affected by HIV/AIDS as their parents were infected with the virus and Rs 2,050 to orphans and destitute children infected by HIV/AIDS under the scheme. 	However, the DCPCR study says there is need to reach out to more children. It is stated that the eligibility criteria are too complex for an affected person to fulfill. According to these, a PLHA has to be on one year of Anti Retroviral Treatment and has to provide proof of the same. Besides being a resident of Delhi for three years, the beneficiary must have an annual family income of less than Rs 1 lakh. In case of orphaned children there has to be proof of death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. In case of a destitute child, proof of HIV positive status is mandatory. The child must also be found living in an institution in Delhi. DCPCR strongly feels these need to be reviewed. 	“Often lack of papers like death certificate or proof of residence can hinder access to these schemes. If the process is simplified, more would be able to get its benefit,” DCPCR chairperson Arun Mathur said. "

The petition, which was filed before a special CBI court in the city, accused the agency of shielding the ruling party’s MLA, Mahendra Mashroo, who was managing Sarvodaya Blood Bank that had provided blood for these kids. Twenty-seven parents have termed the CBI probe incomplete. The CBI has exonerated the laboratory, blood bank and hospital staff. But the petitioners’ counsel Paresh Waghela said that mere absence of mens rea (criminal intention) on part of those responsible for this blunder was not enough to spare them. It was because of their negligence that more than 30 children contracted HIV and five of them have died so far. Advocate Waghela said that the CBI had found 529 of total 1,227 blood donors and traced the donor who had HIV positive. The 2011 reports showed that he was HIV negative. When CBI could locate one person, it proves that there was a problem in the system and there were people responsible for the same. "

Justice Indermeet Kaur in a recent order allowed the appeal filed by Birender (name changed) after it found lack of medical evidence to prove the alleged injuries received by the boy and discrepancies in the victim's statement. ""There is no doubt that the petitioner is suffering and is HIV positive but where a court has returned the finding that there was no prima facie material to hold that there was any unnatural act committed by him upon the victim. The question of his having knowledge that by this act he was likely to spread infection of a disease dangerous to life didn't arise,"" Justice Kaur said while quashing the FIR lodged in Vasant Vihar police station. According to the police, Birender, a shopkeeper, sodomized a boy by closing the doors of his shop and luring the boy in on the pretext of offering him money. Later, the father of the victim lodged a complaint on the basis of the boy's allegations of unnatural sex. Appearing for Birender, advocate Vijay Aggarwal pointed out that medical records clearly show his client never committed the offence of unnatural sex and he can't be held guilty for the offence dealing with spreading of infection because it is implicit that no sexual act took place between him and the alleged victim. A magistrate who first heard the case found that the statements made by the victim and his father were contrary to the version given by the boy under section 164 CrPC. Though the magistrate acquitted Birender, a session's court refused to discharge him of the offence under Section 270 of IPC that deals with ""malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life."" The high court while hearing the revision plea focused on the medico legal case of the victim and found no mention of any external injury in anal region, no pain, no bleeding. The court also pointed out that once an act itself never occurred as per evidence, the knowledge of the accused to spread infection of a dangerous disease by doing such an act can't be accepted as evidence in law.

International medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) released the study published in PLoS One, which is the first to look at the DR-TB burden amongst attendees of ART centres in high HIV-burden settings in cities like Mumbai. 	Conducted in collaboration with the national health authorities in Mumbai between February 2013 and January 2014, attendees at seven large-scale ART centres were screened during more than 14,000 visits, and the sputum of 1,724 patients with TB symptoms was collected. 	The study reveals the proportion of DR-TB to be 25% among new cases of TB and 44% among previously treated TB cases. The findings reinforce the need for national health authorities to ensure timely diagnosis of DR-TB, especially for vulnerable populations and including people living with HIV, in order to curb primary transmission. 	What is alarming is, that it provides evidence that primary transmission is the cause of DR-TB in as many as one in four newly-diagnosed TB patients. 	Primary DR-TB results from the direct transmission of DR-TB from one person to another. The prevention of primary transmission of DR-TB has largely been neglected during the development of TB control programmes. 	These patients were exposed to DR-TB mycobacterium either in their communities or during their visits to health facilities as they have no previous records of receiving treatment for TB. 	“In ‘hot-spots’ such as the slums of Mumbai, and among vulnerable groups such as people living with HIV, the DR-TB epidemic may be driven by primary transmission, rather than simply by a lack of adherence to TB treatment,” says Dr Petros Isaakidis, MSF principal investigator of the study. “The government needs to pay more attention to primary transmission of DR-TB, particularly in settings of high HIV prevalence and rapid TB spread. Promptly diagnosing and treating DR-TB is the solution to curb primary transmission.” 	The data highlights the urgent need to address DR-TB among people living with HIV by systematically offering screening, drug susceptibility testing (DST) and access to treatment based on actual resistance patterns. 	“We need to urgently prevent transmission of DR-TB to others. With DR-TB, treatment is prevention, and these findings should lead to a stronger focus on diagnostics and treatment of DR-TB, particularly in high HIV-prevalent settings,” says Eldred Tellis of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. “This is in addition to the fact that health authorities cannot afford to neglect TB infection control in overcrowded healthcare facilities like ART centres.” 	“This study comes at the right time. Studies like this are complementary to the national survey and are essential to get a close-up picture of the DR-TB epidemic in ‘hot-spots’ and marginalised populations,” says Dr Arun Bamne, co-author of the study and former executive health officer of Mumbai’s Public Health Department. “Such studies will help shape the national response with specific interventions for those populations most at risk of getting DR-TB.” 	TB is one of the most common opportunistic infections and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV/AIDS. Undiagnosed and untreated drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity among people living with HIV. 	In September, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan formally launched the first-ever nationwide TB drug-resistance survey to get a better understanding of the disease in the country. "

A study conducted among MSMs (men who have sex with men) in the city revealed that most of the homosexuals wanted guidance on overcoming stress arising out of social stigma. About 55 gays, ranging from post-graduate students to sex workers, were interviewed in a study conducted by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) in collaboration with Sahodaran (an NGO for MSMs). Though the study says that gay men in India have an HIV seroprevalence rate that is 22 times higher than the country’s general population, those surveyed have a different take. “It is better not to keep concentrating on HIV… I think it is important to raise the low self-esteem of MSMs,” one of the interviewees said. Those who participated in the survey showed a high degree of awareness of HIV prevention. Nevertheless, they expressed concerns surrounding their mental health. Some complained of high levels of depression which they said followed after they had disclosed their sexual orientation. Changed behaviour of their family members, ridicule from peers and a sense of social rejection, said the interviewees, have taken a toll on their self-esteem. The interviewees also pointed out lack of privacy in state-run STI clinics (health centres which deal with sexually transmitted diseases). Once their sexual identity is disclosed, the homosexuals often face discrimination and harassment. This, some stated, forced them into alcohol or substance abuse. As a remedy, most stated that they preferred individual counseling. “When the society ridicules, having multiple partners becomes a desirable way to feel accepted. Unless they get help to come to terms and respect themselves, the sexual risk they face cannot be addressed. We have disseminated this study to NACO and few NGOs to carry out counseling,” said scientist Beena Thomas, NIRT. "

These patients were exposed to DR-TB mycobacterium either in their communities or during their visits to health facilities as they have no previous records of receiving treatment for TB. The study’s co-author Dr Arun Bamne, who was the city’s executive health officer until recently, said such studies give insight into the TB load among marginalised populations and help shape specific health intervention programmes. The study was conducted among HIV-positive people attending seven ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres. More than 14,000 visits were studied, and sputum of 1,724 patients with TB symptoms was collected. The study was released to coincide with the Union World Conference on Lung Health which begins in Barcelona later this week. “The findings reinforce the need for national health authorities to ensure timely diagnosis of DR-TB (drug resistant), especially for vulnerable populations and including people living with HIV, in order to curb primary transmission,” said the MSF press release. “We need to urgently prevent transmission of DR-TB to others.

The study says there is a need to promptly diagnose drug-resistance among all HIV-infected people by systematically offering access to first- and second-line drug-sensitivity testing to patients with ‘presumptive TB’ rather than ‘presumptive DR-TB’ and tailor treatment regimen based on the resistance patterns. MSF has been running an HIV/DR-TB clinic in Mumbai since 2006, focusing on patients with drug-resistant TB, HIV or both infections together. "

They talked about the rights of such patients, various precautions to be taken by them, need to consult a doctor and side effects of taking medicines without consulting a doctor etc. The seminar was conducted by the branch of Etawah based NGO in collaboration with Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society and Uttar Pradesh Welfare for People Living with HIV/AIDS Society. Speaking at the seminar Dr Chaman Kumar Vanvani, senior medical officer, Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) centre, said, ""Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS have to face a lot of societal pressure, which results in negative impact on the treatment. HIV is a war that can be won with the help of each one of us, it should not be considered as a punishment. It is very important that these patients are aware about their rights and different facilities that are being provided by the government,” he said. AIDS-related stigma and discrimination refers to prejudice, negative attitude and maltreatment directed at people living with HIV and AIDS. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are wide-ranging: being shunned by family, peers and the wider community, poor treatment in healthcare, psychological damage and negative effect on success of HIV testing and treatment, he added. The doctor said that the HIV deadly virus can be tackled just like any other disease. “The government provides free counselling and antiretroviral drugs to such patients. These are available at the ART centres all over the country. If someone is suffering from frequent fever, skin problems or any other type of illness, he should immediately go for HIV test. Once the virus is detected in the human body, the person needs to consult a doctor. Eating healthy diet rich in protein and anti-oxidant can help a sufferer lead a long life. Also, one should go for CD4 count test every six month to keep a track of the level of antibodies in the body,” he said. The doctor debunked the myth that HIV and AIDS are same. He said that just like many other diseases HIV and AIDS are two different stages of the disease. The event was attended by about 50 patients of the city."

124,11,2014,'Editing' blood stem cells to fight HIV?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Editing-blood-stem-cells-to-fight-HIV/articleshow/45077033.cms,"WASHINGTON: Harvard researchers have used a new gene-editing technique to create what could prove to be an effective method for blocking HIV from invading and destroying patients' immune systems. This is the first published report of a group using CRISPR/Cas technology to efficiently and precisely edit clinically relevant genes out of cells collected directly from people, in this case human blood-forming stem cells and T-cells, researchers said. The work was led by Chad Cowan and Derrick Rossi, associate professors in Harvard's Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (HSCRB). HIV specifically targets T cells, a principal portion of the blood-based immune system, and enters via a gene receptor called CCR5 that serves as a doorway into the cells. Once inside the T cells, HIV replicates and kills off the host cells, leaving patients at the mercy of a variety of opportunistic infections. Using the CRISPR/Cas gene-editing technology, the researchers knocked the CCR5 receptor out of blood stem cells that they showed could give rise to differentiated blood cells that did not have CCR5. In theory, such gene-edited stem cells could be introduced into HIV patients via bone marrow transplantation, the procedure used to transplant blood stem cells into leukemia patients, to give rise to HIV-resistant immune systems. ""We showed that you can knock out CCR5 very efficaciously, we showed that the cells are still functional, and we did very, very deep sequencing analysis to show that there were no unwanted mutations, so it appears to be safe,"" Cowan said. Though the researchers believe that this new approach to HIV therapy might be ready for human safety trials in less than five years, they urge caution. The work could run into unexpected complications and the history of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is littered with ""cures"" that turned out not to be, researchers said. Even if this new approach works perfectly, it will require additional developments to be applicable in the areas of the world that have been the hardest hit by the epidemic, they said. "

The 35-year old youth patient, a resident of Rajnandgaon, the home constituency of chief minister Dr Raman Singh, who reportedly needs dialysis, has been denied treatment not only by private hospitals but also the state run premier institutes, Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital. The denial of treatment to the youth is a contravention of the apex court’s orders and the HIV AIDS bill 2007 that prohibits discrimination of a HIV/AIDS patient in several matters, including healthcare. According to sources, the youth was recently diagnosed with HIV at a private hospital in Raipur. Since his condition was deteriorating, he was advised to undergo dialysis and initially approached Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial hospital, which denied treatment to him. He subsequently approached Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital, which too denied treatment to him and asked him to approach private hospitals. Sources said with no hospital was willing to undertake his treatment, the youth has gone back to his hometown. According to Dr Puneet Gupta, nephrologist at Ambedkar hospital, the youth was initially undergoing treatment for some ailments at a private hospital where he was diagnosed with HIV. “Once the doctors there learnt about his condition, they washed their hands off and advised him to move to other hospitals or a government run institute,” said Dr Gupta. Dr Gupta admitted that the patient had approached dialysis unit but the same was denied to him, as there is a risk of transmission of HIV through machines if they are used on patients suffering from the disease. He said though they manage treatment of such patients through drugs, they couldn't use dialysis machines on them, as it can put other patients to risk. “If a dialysis machine is used on a patient suffering from HIV, it not only affect the other machine due to same pipes interconnected but needs sterilized again, which isn't a very simple procedure”, explained Dr Gupta.

The girl's family is now spending sleepless nights, worried if the virus has been transmitted to the girl as well. 	The incident took place in Andheri on November 2, when the child was sent to the house of the 45-year-old accused to collect rent. The man, a distant uncle of the child, has known the family for over 15 years and has been living in the same neighbourhood; he had recently rented one of the rooms owned by the survivor's family. 	As she entered the room around 11am, the accused locked the door and allegedly attacked the girl. But the child fought back, screaming loudly, which apparently angered the accused. ""Enraged, he bit her when she tried to get away from him,"" the child's aunt said. ""She still managed to free herself from his clutches and ran back home in tears and told us about her ordeal. She had bruises that were clearly visible."" The family turned even more distraught after the child's mother pointed out that the accused was HIV positive and his first wife had died of HIV-TB. 	""A chill ran down my spine. We rushed to the DN Nagar police station where we were told to visit RN Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle without delay,"" said the aunt, adding they went there, racing against time. ""We worried that even a single minute wasted would take her close to the infection,"" she said, adding Cooper doctors gave the child the first dose of anti-retroviral at 2.30pm and the medicine was continued for three days. ""Luckily, the treatment was started immediately,"" the girl's father said. 	Cooper Hospital doctors first performed the mandatory baseline HIV rapid test to check for infection. The girl's father said his wife and he could barely breathe till the report came negative. ""This report is of little consequence though. We have been told the virus has a window period of three months to manifest itself. We never thought we would ever cross paths with HIV,"" said the father, an auto driver. 	A senior Cooper Hospital doctor told TOI the child was immediately started on a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment for three days. ""We have referred the child to Sion Hospital that has a full-fledged peadiatric HIV care facility,"" the doctor said. At Sion, she will be put on a 28-day PEP regime. ""The wound can be classified as mild to moderate."" 	Head of paediatrics at Sion Hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said chances of transmission in such cases are usually negligible. ""But a lot depends on the wound, its depth and if there was any fluid exchange such as blood,"" she said. Manglani added a PCR test could be carried out after a month to check the status, but an ELISA test after three months is mostly considered conclusive. 	The accused has been sent to the DN Nagar police's custody. The police have also approached the KEM Hospital forensic department to examine the bite marks. The child started going to school from Monday. "

NHS England said the “significant patient recall” has resulted from concerns over a dentist who treated patients in the Nottingham area. The dentist Desmond D'Mello used to work for the Daybrook Dental Surgery. The recall was sparked by concerns that D'Mello, who treated patients over a 32-year period, did not follow proper procedures. NHS England said that since June 2014, it has been working with Public Health England to investigate apparent breaches of infection control procedures by a single dentist, who was contracted to provide NHS dental services at the former Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottinghamshire. It said, “Our investigation demonstrates that acceptable infection control standards do not appear to have been followed by Mr Desmond D’Mello whilst he was treating patients at the former Daybrook Dental Practice. Immediate actions were taken to protect current patients once these apparent lapses were identified. However, this alleged drop in clinical standards may have put people at a low risk of blood born viruses like Hepatitis B, C and HIV. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, we are advising all patients who have seen Mr D’Mello to seek further advice on what action they may need to take”. The investigation team has also consulted with clinical experts in Public Health England, who undertook a clinical analysis of the potential risk to patients. Mr D’Mello has recently been tested by our Occupational Health Team and found to be clear of blood borne viruses. NHS said, “Based on this clinical advice, Public Health England has recommended screening for all patients who have been treated by Mr D’Mello. It is understood the number of patients affected who have been seen and treated by Mr D’Mello during his time at the former Daybrook Dental Practice is about 22,000, as he had worked at the practice for over 32 years”.

The couple met on facebook and married after doubts were removed. They are now planning a child through alternative methods. Maria (28) and Mangesh (29) spent hours chatting online during the last two years and the latter proposed her. She initially turned down the proposal explaining that she was a widow and mother of a five-year-old son. Mangesh got a shock when Maria revealed that her husband died of AIDS and she is also HIV positive. But Mangesh repeated the proposal after a few days. A school teacher, Maria arrived in Surat to spend some time with Mangesh and agreed to marry him. He was living separately from his parents. The two got married a couple of months ago and are now living with Maria's son. ""I liked her since the day I met her online. With available medication a HIV positive person can live a normal life with a negative person. I did not want her to fight her problems alone,"" said Mangesh who has only one working hand. ""I was surprised to see their commitment towards each other. It shows that love can fight HIV AIDS. They are now under counseling and treatment for safe pregnancy. With the proper treatment the child will not get HIV infection,"" said Dr Alap Mehta, senior consultant for HIV AIDS treatment at New Civil Hospital (NCH). ""We will inject semen into the woman through a syringe. The mother will continue with HIV medication of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART). Results of last few years show there is 99.99 percent surety that the infection would not be transmitted to the child. After birth, dry blood spot test can confirm that the child is not infected,"" added Dr Mehta. (Names of the couple have been changed to protect identity)"

Instead, with one patch applied on their skin every week, such patients will be able to fight the dreadful disease! A researcher at the Department of Pharmacy of M S University's Faculty of Technology and Engineering is developing formulations for transdermal delivery of an anti-HIV drug known as Lopinavir. The research project, which started in 2010 with Rs 10.5 lakh fund allotted by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), is aimed at developing formulations which can deliver the anti-HIV drug through skin. At present, the anti-HIV drug formulations are in the oral tablet form. The research is aimed at making the drug more effective. ""Consumed in the oral form - tablets - the drug goes to liver and then to blood, where it acts against the virus. However, almost 80 per cent of this drug gets destroyed in liver by the enzymes and only 20 per cent of it reaches the blood and other organs of the body where it is actually needed,"" Dr Hetal Thakkar, who in course of the project has studied the transdermal drug delivery projects undertaken by the United States and United Kingdom-based reputed laboratories, told TOI. ""If the drug can be delivered through skin, then it will directly reach the blood without encountering the liver and hence is saved from destruction. But skin is a tough protective barrier and hence delivery of drugs through skin is difficult,"" said Thakkar, adding that to overcome this limitation, the drug was entrapped in nanocarriers which can easily permeate through skin. ""We have conducted studies on animals and we have got some promising results. When we compared the formulations developed by us with the oral formulations on rats, we found that there is nearly three times higher blood concentration which means we can also reduce the dosage of anti-HIV drug. Now, we will apply for clinical trials,"" said Thakkar. According to Thakkar, reduction in dosage of the drug will also help reduce the side effects of the drug like nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal disturbances which HIV/AIDS patients complain about during treatment. ""If the side-effects can be reduced, the overall quality of life of the patients will improve and help in building of a healthy society. Also, the treatment will be more economical,"" she said. "

The centre aims at training around 4,000 counsellors including project managers, outreach workers and peer educators who deal with high risk groups such as sex workers, homosexuals, transgenders, injecting drug users, migrants and truckers who are considered as prone to HIV infection. As many as 135 NGOs are sending participants for the training, which will be held for two years in batches. Each batch will train 30 participants. An academic committee has also been set up to prepare the curriculum for training. NACO manual is mainly referred to make the curriculum. “Promoting condoms, educating on treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and social entitlement programmes are the main part of the training. Interaction with sex workers will also be held during the programme,” said Mahadev Swamy, training officer.

Howrah District Hospital admitted her after a person intervened, but there she was allegedly kept overnight near the toilet of a ward, next to where a body was kept. When informed by TOI, the Howrah chief medical officer (health) expressed shock over the incident and said that he would get her admitted on Wednesday. On November 8, Babita Dolui (name changed), a resident of Ramrajatala, was travelling on a bicycle with her husband on Kona Expressway. The 32-year-old woman and her husband are masons and both of them were returning home from work . A speeding lorry knocked them down in Chatterjee Haat police station area. Babita fractured her right arm and cracked her spine, while her husband escaped with minor injuries. The police rushed her to Howrah District Hospital. “She was semi-conscious when she was taken to the hospital. Doctors and nurses at the hospital asked Babita’s husband whether she had any chronic disease. Her husband reportedly told them that she was HIV+. The doctors and nurses told my son-in-law that he also suffers from the “dirty” disease and they ought to lock him up. After hearing this, my son-in-law ran away. We came to know of the accident late in the evening. When we went to the hospital, Babita was lying on the floor and hadn’t been attended to. The doctors and nurses told us to take her away as they wouldn’t even touch her,” said Babita’s mother. The next day, Babita’s mother took her daughter to the Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta. The doctors there looked at the documents issued by the Howrah Hospital and told the elderly woman to take Babita away. “They told me that such patients can’t be treated there. They asked me to take her back home and wait for the injuries to heal naturally,” Babita’s mother added. When the woman produced a reference letter from local MLA Jatu Lahiri, a doctor allegedly retorted: “Who is the MLA to refer such a patient to us?” On Novermber 18, Babita’s mother informed the matter to their family friend Amit Goswami, who is a law clerk. Goswami then took her to Howrah District Hospital and insisted that they admit her. The hospital authorities assured Goswami that things would be taken care of. “Next morning, Babita was found lying on the floor next to the toilet of a ward. She said that a body had been kept on the floor beside her,” Babita’s mother said."

The woman had been thrown out of two state-run hospitals even after suffering serious injuries in a road accident. Debashis Roy, the chief medical officer (health), Howrah, set up a three-member committee to probe the allegations and informed that all expenses for the woman’s treatment will be borne by the district administration. Babita Dolui (name changed) fractured her right arm and cracked her spine in a road accident on November 8. When she was taken to Howrah District Hospital, doctors and nurses turned her away when her husband reportedly said she was HIV-positive. The Calcutta Medical College Hospital also refused Babita. She was admitted to the Howrah hospital on November 18, but had to spend the night on the floor next to a corpse beside the toilet. Since then, Babita was at home. When Roy was contacted by TOI on Tuesday, he said Babita would be admitted to the Howrah hospital on Wednesday. Around 4.45pm, she was wheeled into the female surgical ward with the dignity that all patients deserve, notwithstanding whether they are HIV-positive or not. In the morning, the CMOH called up Babita’s family and asked them to take her to the hospital. Neighbours then fetched an ambulance. “It was a shameful incident. I took steps from the time I came to know of this from TOI on Tuesday. Funds for her treatment will be provided from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. A three-member committee comprising deputy CMOH-I Ranjit Das, Howrah District Hospital superintendent Narayan Chatterjee and nursing superintendent Manisha Ghosh has been set up to probe the incident. The committee will submit its report in two days. Tests will be carried out to ascertain whether the woman is HIV-positive. Her mother claims that she has no knowledge of this. I wonder on what basis the doctors mentioned this on her prescription,” the CMOH said. Bablu Adak, a neighbour, said that they will stand by Babita. “We will ensure she doesn’t suffer. We want to know on what basis the doctors declared her HIV-positive,” Adak said. Minister Arup Roy said that he read about Babita’s plight in TOI and called up the CMOH. “I asked him to arrange for her treatment immediately and conduct a proper inquiry and take necessary action against those responsible,” he said. Gautam Mukherjee, the Howrah hospital doctor who wrote her prescription on November 18, declaring her HIV-positive was unrepentant. “Her husband was carrying a medical slip that had HIV-positive written on it. The emergency doctor wrote HIV-positive on the prescription and I signed on good faith. I refuse to give an explanation as to why no test was carried out,” he said."

The dip among high-risk population however continues to be very marginal. 	For instance, the incidence fell from 0.61% in 2013 to mere 0.59% in 2014. Mumbai continues to be one of the high-risk districts within the state given the migration patterns. Over 2.30 lakh population, including 28,000 female sex workers, 19,000 men having sex with men and 1800 intravenous drug users, fall within this category. 	Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) said that several steps are being taken to reach out to this population. “We are planning to open three new Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) at the Mumbai Port Trust. There will also be three mobile vans to facilitate testing among truckers,” she said. It is estimated that over 20,000 truckers halt in the city at any given year. 	MDACS, which is the nodal body to tackle HIV in the city, was itself reeling under a fund crunch till two weeks ago. They also had to take a loan of Rs8crore from the BMC to tide over the crunch. “It has not slowed down our activities. We are aiming at zero infection and discrimination,” she said. She added the body is adding two more antiretroviral centres to the existing dozen centres at Bhabha Hospital in Bandra and Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar. 	Acharya added that the rates of mother-to-child transmission have also been steadily declining. From 1.10% in 2008-09 it has dropped to 0.25% in 2012-13. “The new multidrug regimen for prevention of HIV among newborns is working well,” she said. 	Around two years after the HIV epidemic hit home, the Maharashtra Aids Control Society (MSACS) has initiated a programme to trace patients who have been enrolled for care at some point. “Currently, at least 50,000 patients are lost to follow up, who may have died or migrated to other places. We will find them and give a unique number,” said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, project director, MSACS. "

Unsafe blood transfusion and syringe usage are believed to be major reasons behind the worrying trend. With almost four months left for the financial year 2014-15 to get over, number of HIV positive in the under 14 years of age group has touched 324 mark till October, 2014. In last six years time, highest 338 HIV positive cases were diagnosed in 2012. Total number of HIV cases in under 14 years of age group since 2008 has reached 2,152. District nodal officer (AIDS) Dr Vijay Chajjlani said, “Rising number of HIV cases in less than 14 years of age group is definitely a matter of concern. Two children were recently diagnosed HIV positive due to unsafe blood transfusion and syringe use.” “People should ensure taking blood only from registered blood banks and fresh syringe should be used everytime,” he added. There has also been a spurt in number of pregnant women coming forward for integrated counselling and testing since 2010, say health department data. However, the overall figure of HIV positive population, including general and pregnant women continues to be stagnant in comparison to the past few years. “People, especially pregnant women are more aware and they are coming in large numbers for voluntary counseling and testing. Also, decreasing percentage of people, who have tested positive to HIV in past few years is a good sign,” said the chief medical and health officer Dr Ashok Dagaria. Overall in state, 37,65,558 people were tested for HIV and 39,114 were confirmed positive during the period 2005 to October 2014. "

Not only is the incidence declining among the high risk groups, but also observed among the general population. Confirming this, officials from the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS), Hyderabad, and District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Vizag, said the incidence has declined not only among the vulnerable high risk groups (HRG), MSMs (homosexual males) and injectible drug users (IDUs), but also among the general population, including pregnant women, that underwent tests for HIV. Incidentally this year’s National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) theme for World AIDS Day is ‘Zindagi Zindabad’ targeting zero stigma, zero new infections and zero AIDS deaths. ""Four-five years ago, out of 100 people who tested for HIV, three-four would test positive but now two people are testing positive out of every 100 undertaking HIV tests in the district. Also, more and more people are coming for getting tested. Similarly, 0.2 per cent pregnant woman are now testing positive for HIV, which was around 0.7 per cent 4-5 years ago. This prevalence is more in urban areas than rural and Agency areas,"" said Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (ADMHO, AIDS and leprosy). As for HRGs, new incidence of HIV has come down from 11 per cent to 7 per cent between 2008 and 2012, from 7 per cent to 3.75 per cent among the IDUs and a massive decline among MSMs — from 23 per cent to 10 per cent — all in the same time period. Overall, as per the latest statistics of undivided AP, the prevalence of HIV has fallen from 1.22 per cent to 0.77 per cent among the general population, which includes pregnant women as well, said T Kailashditya, joint director of Targeted Intervention (TI), APSACS. As per APSACS and NACO data, in undivided AP, there are around five lakh HIV positive people and though all the 23 districts fall under ‘A’ category, there are 10 priority districts where the incidence of HIV is the highest. Interestingly, most of these are coastal Andhra districts, including Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Prakasam, Krishna, apart from Anantapur in Rayalaseema. Three high priority Telangana districts include Warangal, Hyderabad and Karimnagar. ""The prevalence of HIV is more in coastal districts due to various activities that entail migration and support a floating population,"" said T Kailashditya. Coming to HIV statistics in Vizag, at present there are around 26,000 registered HIV-positive people, of which 11,000 patients are under anti-retroviral treatment (ART) while the remaining 15,000 don’t require ART drugs yet as their CD4 count (a kind of white blood cell that indicates immunity level) is more than 350. Included in the 11,000 are also around 350 HIV positive children below 15 years who have been put under ART drugs, averred Dr Ramesh. "
139,11,2014,Barbers expose customers to HIV infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/Barbers-expose-customers-to-HIV-infection/articleshow/45327906.cms,"AGRA: Even after spending crores in creating HIV and AIDS awareness, the precautions that must be taken against the deadly infection hinge on a razor’s edge. A quick shave could be a close shave. Hundreds of roadside barbers in the city use just one razor or blade for shaving several customers. This means that with just a nick by an infected razor/blade, a customer can contract fatal infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B and C. Shockingly, there is no system or organization in the state or even across the country to check this unsafe practice. There are no checks on the barbers working at various public places, especially at railway stations, bus stands and government hospitals. Hundreds of customers unknowingly expose themselves to danger when they go to such barbers. Straight razors with open steel blades, also commonly known as cut-throats, were the most These roadside barbers can be seen at every nook and corner of the town using either straight razors with open steel blades, commonly known as cut-throats or disposable razors. They perform multiple shaves within a few minutes and do not bother to change the blade. What is more shocking is that even the persons who get themselves shaved do not ask for a new blade or a fresh razor. “I shave at least 20 people every day. My customers are generally passengers who do not halt in the city but have come for a meeting or an exam. They freshen-up at public toilets at the station, get a shave here and go off to work,” said Sanju, a barber at Agra Fort Railway Station. This barber was ferrying his equipment in a box and had placed his makeshift salon on his bicycle. Needless to say, there is no scope, even for sterilizing the equipment or razors. The barber when asked about his knowledge on HIV and AIDS, he said, “Ye sab to galat kaam karne se hota hai, dadhi banwane se nahi. Or Itna sochenge to khayenge kya (These things happen because of wrong acts and not because of shaving. If we will think that much, what will we eat).” He further asserted that he charges only Rs 3 from a shave. If he increases the rates, people will not come to him. Similarly, a barber working outside SN Medical College was seen using the same old blade to shave patients’ relatives. What are the precautions he takes? His refrain is, “I clean the razor with warm water before using it on other customer. We also sharpen the razor on stones whereby it gets cleaned automatically,” said Daddu, standing by his small salon on pavement. He also cited his meager income for not changing blades for each customer. According to doctors, this unsafe practice by barbers is simply not on the same page as the HIV and AIDS control department. No educational sessions or workshops have ever been conducted for the barbers, who are barely aware of the damger of using the same blade on multiple customers. “Prevention is the only viable way to control HIV spread, as there is no cure for the infection presently. The risk of infection spreading is low with razors, maybe two in 1,000 but nevertheless, it is advisable that only one with disposable blades should be used,” said Dr CP Singh, expert from the medicine department of SN Medical College. He added that the general perception is that HIV is transmitted through unsafe sex, infected blood transfusions and mother-to-child. These are the second and third highest reasons for HIV infections. But HIV infections can also be passed through sharing of non-sterile sharp instruments such as those used by barbers, incision, tattooing, ear perforation, blood-letting, injections and acupuncture. These too have always been classified as “other” reasons for spreading the infection and therefore given less attention in the campaign against the spread of HIV. “Though barbers do not carry out procedures that deliberately penetrate the skin but sometimes just a single mick or cut caused by the clipper or razor blade is enough for an infection to occur,” added Dr Singh. The doctors when asked how safe is to clean or wash the blade before using, he informed that due to the lipid envelope that protects HIV from dehydration, the virus can survive on the surfaces of barbering instruments for a period long enough for transmission to occur, particularly in commercial barber shops. Talking to TOI, chief medical officer HS Danu said there are no measures or laws to stop this roadside barbering practice all across UP. This is an ethical responsibility of the district administration and civic body to issue no licenses to these roadside barbers. “But these days, they do not even halt at roadside. They ferry their salon on bycycles and its impossible to check such practices,” added the CMO. "

Ten years ago, he was diagnosed HIV positive, but that did not make him lose heart. Instead, HIV+ gave him the aim of his life. Recipient of many national awards, Gyan Ranjan, project coordinator, Bihar Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (BNP), is today busy taking up cudgels on behalf of people with AIDS. “If you hide your identity, how will you fight for your cause? People with AIDS must be outspoken and see to it they get every facility to lead whatever life is left in them,” Gyan told TOI on the eve of World AIDS Day. His office is located at Mahendru. Gyan was leading a happy married life and engaged in gemstones’ business till September 2000, when he met an accident. “I was hospitalized at a government hospital for 15 days. But, I started falling ill frequently after that,” says Gyan. Probably, he contracted AIDS there, but he was unaware of it. In the meantime, he donated blood for a friend. After 15 days, he got a letter saying he should contact an ART centre. “I did not know what it was. When I went there, the banners talking about AIDS made me realize the impending disaster in my life,” Gyan says. Both he and his wife tested positive for AIDS. “We went into hiding for 15 days,” he says. They were advised not to bear kids. “We had earlier planned to have a test-tube baby, but shelved the plan,” Gyan says. On his father’s intervention, their medication started. Gyan wind up his business. In 2006, came the first high point. “My child was born and today he is six years old and leading a healthy life,” says Gyan. Gyan is today president of BNP. He gets support of Bihar State Aids Control Society, Plan India and other NGOs and “gets paid on project basis.” Today his organization has 58 staff, 80% of whom are HIV positive. Every staff member is a story unto him/herself. Gyan’s organization has chapters in five districts and facilitates surgeries of people with AIDS. When doctors refuse to operate on them, BNP takes up the issue with the management of the hospital concerned. “On November 29, a 30-year-old Danapur resident got operated for hernia at PMCH on our intervention. He was refused surgery two months back. This is what keeps me going,” says Gyan, his face beaming. His office has become one-stop point for such people. Over 1,000 persons awaiting surgeries are registered with his organization, which also provides counselling to people with AIDS and even marries them off. Recently, Gyan organized wedding of three HIV positive couples. Asked about the lowest point in his struggle, he narrates a 2012 incident when he was sitting on dharna to protest shortage of antiretroviral drugs at BSACS office. “I was arrested and murder charge was slapped on me,” says Gyan, who was jailed for a month and released on bail thereafter."
141,12,2014,New therapy to cut down HIV drug dose from 3 pills to 1,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/New-therapy-to-cut-down-HIV-drug-dose-from-3-pills-to-1/articleshow/45329382.cms,"Lucknow: A new protocol for management of HIV AIDS will be launched across AAL anti-retro-viral therapy (ART) centers across UP reducing the number of pills from three to one. It also promises relief to patients from severe side effects caused by drugs prescribed under ART. HIV-AIDS patients would be put on fixed dose therapy (FDT) in which a single pill would be given in place of three drugs that cause side effects and will reduce pressure on kidney and liver. Speaking with TOI ahead of the world HIV AIDS Awareness Day, Indian Society of Haemetology and Blood Transfusion president A K Tripathi said, “FDT will soon be introduced across all ART centers across UP. In King George's Medical University it will be launched in mid-December.” The single pill, often referred to as the wonder drug in AIDS treatment, comprises three medicines given as first line of treatment. Also, salts used in them are better than the previous formula. One of these three (stavudine) was known to cause lipid abnormalities and neuropathy. As a result, fat deposits occur in the patient’s body in specific places while it dries up in other (lipodystrophy) leading to severe disfigurement. Blood cholestrol levels also go up posing risk to heart health and causing burning sensation in hands and feet. Stavudine has been replaced with tenofovir. The other salt called nevirapine had three major side effects, including damage to liver, severe allergic reaction and interference in treatment of tuberculosis. This salt has been replaced with effavirenz. The third medicine called lamivudine has been retained as it is. A policy decision to this effect was taken in May 2013 and was implemented later. It is now being launched in UP. “Side effects tend to compel patients to skip medicines, which compromises the adherence rate. Success of the aids control programme cannot be guaranteed unless adherence rate is above 90% which the wonder drug helps achieve,” explained Dr Tripathi. Besides introducing this drug, National Aids Control Organisation has introduced changes in the treatment guidelines which promise better success of the programme. One of them, which relates to pregnant women, says they should all be tested for HIV AIDS and if found positive, should be put on ART irrespective or the CD4 count reading. It may be noted that CD4 count is the parameter for putting a patient on ART. Till 2013 a CD4 count of 250 made an HIV-positive person eligible for ART. After a revised order, a CD4 count of 350 meant clearance for ART. The new guidelines also overlook CD4 count for HIV positive persons diagnosed of TB."

India has managed to bring down new HIV cases over the past five to six years by bringing in more patients under treatment and promoting use of condoms, mainly among the vulnerable population such as sex workers, drug addicts and transgenders. However, inconsistency in supplies and frequent stock outs of lifesaving HIV medicines in government owned centres in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and the northeast have the potential to put India back in the danger zone, experts warn. “Once a patient starts the therapy, medicine needs to be taken daily with proper adherence, or else the drugs quickly lose their effectiveness. Once this happens, HIV patients have to switch to a second line of treatment which is five times more expensive than first-line drugs, adding an additional burden on our healthcare system,” said Daisy David, advocacy officer, World Vision India. Moreover, there is also a severe dearth of testing kits like CD4 and viral load, which are crucial for patients to monitor the virus and ascertain the stage of infection. “These tests are important because they help a doctor ascertain when to change the line of treatment for particular patients. In the absence of these tests, a patient may develop resistance to a certain medicine or line of treatment and hence develop the virus again,” said Vikas Ahuja, president of Delhi Network of Positive People, a trust that works with HIV/AIDS patients. A World Health Organisation (WHO) report last year said the Indian government was providing free anti-retroviral drugs for treating HIV since 2004, but only 50% of those eligible were getting it in 2012. According to Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective, a faulty procurement policy, withdrawal of global funding from India and other middle income countries and discrimination with the vulnerable population including sex workers and drug addicts were major causes leading to such problems. The health ministry recently told Lok Sabha that though there were shortages, it had resolved the issue for the time being by procurement and donations from a domestic pharmaceutical company. The ministry has also initiated a computerized supply chain management system for assessment of drug requirement and their stocks. The latest data from National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) shows there are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients. The government receives nearly $80 million from the Global Fund, an international aid organisation for HIV prevention and treatment. The United Nations estimates India currently has the third largest population of people living with HIV in the world. However, NACO data shows a significant decline in prevalence of HIV among adults across the country. At national level, prevalence was estimated at 0.41% in 2001, whereas it dropped to 0.35% in 2006 and 0.27% in 2011, latest data with the department showed. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia, said stigma, discrimination and restrictive laws continued to be barriers to accessing prevention, care and treatment services. “The HIV epidemic in our region is concentrated among populations most vulnerable to HIV: men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, sex workers, people in prisons and other closed settings. Although we have been successful in scaling up the health sector response for the vulnerable populations, more needs to be done. Less than 50% of these people know their HIV status,” she said. Though the government is hopeful the HIV and AIDS bill, drafted in 2006, which was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in February and is currently being considered by a parliamentary standing committee, will address most of these issues, Grover said even the draft bill keeps people with HIV and AIDS out of the purview of free medicines. “Just by ignoring the issue, the government cannot tackle the real menace of the disease. It needs to guarantee access to medicines for all,” Grover said. "
143,12,2014,30% percent HIV patients in Goa are non-Goans: GSACS,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/30-percent-HIV-patients-in-Goa-are-non-Goans-GSACS/articleshow/45329217.cms,"PONDA: With a large number of migrants pouring into Goa, the HIV epidemic is turning into a frightening reality as the state has registered about 30 percent cases of HIV infection among non-Goans including people from other states and foreigners. A cause for alarm is that though the number of HIV infections has decreased this year as compared to the last, the number of HIV patients has increased. From January to October this year, Goa registered 128 cases of non-Goans among the total 376 cases registered across the state. During the corresponding period of last year, the figure was 86 of the total 386 cases registered by October 2013. Though the disease surfaced in Goa in 1987 when a foreigner was detected HIV positive with the second case being of a non-Goan in 1988, Goa has so-far registered 15,603 HIV positive persons. While Goa has registered 1,662 full-blown AIDS cases up to October, a total of 1,041 patients have lost their lives to AIDS by September this year, states data prepared by the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS). According to data gathered by GSACS, HIV infection is now prevalent in all parts of Goa. What is worrying is that in Goa, HIV is not confined to coastal belts, but has penetrated to other areas, too. The disease is no longer an urban phenomenon, but has spread to rural areas as well. The HIV prevalence is shifting its base from one taluka to other, every year. In 2013, the majority of the cases was reported in the four coastal talukas: Salcete (18.4%), Mormugao (12.8%) in south Goa district and Tiswadi (11.5%) and Bardez (14.9%) in north Goa district during 2013. But, by October 2014, Tiswadi in the north showed a marginal decrease with 5.3% prevalence, while Bardez in the same district has shown a rise of about 2.7% (16.2% in 2014). In South Goa, Salcete has shown a decline of 4.3%. The taluka has noted 14.1% prevalence as against 18.4% of last year and Mormugao a decline of 2.7%. Last year, HIV prevalence in this taluka was 12.8% which has decreased to 10.1% this year, GSACS statistic stated. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, claimed that a large floating population in Goa has contributed to the bulging figure of HIV-infected in the state. People migrating to Goa from other Indian states raises the figure. The state has noted a spread of the disease largely by the sexual mode. While the state has a thriving drug trade on its coastal belts, there were very less number of people found affected with passing on the needles used for injecting narcotic drugs, she admitted. “Besides, most of the people from other Indian states come to Goa to get their blood sample checked as Goa has better facilities than other states,” Patankar said. She also said that Goa has proper counseling, awareness-raising measures, accurate testing facilities across the state and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) center at Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim. There are 3,476 people including 1,962 males, 1,327 females, 183 children below the age of 14 years and four transgenders have registered for the ART, statistics point out. "

These are the only states with more than one lakh people with HIV.READ ALSO: Fresh HIV cases in Tamil Nadu drop 60% in three years After Tamil Nadu’s 80,000-odd cases, Gujarat is listed with 40,121 cases. States such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which are larger both in area and population, have not recorded many cases. The rising numbers in the southern states are attributed to efficient screening over the last few years, said experts. “The southern states have taken AIDS awareness and prevention very seriously in the last five years. The state governments along with non-governmental organizations have ensured compulsory screening up to the village level, which has resulting in better documentation and recording of HIV cases,” said Vijay Raman, deputy director of Voluntary Health Services, a non-profit multi-specialty hospital in Tamil Nadu. Though the cumulative numbers are high in the south, the number of fresh cases being recorded every year has dropped significantly since 2010. According to the health ministry, the total number new cases has reduced almost 50% across the country in three years—from 3.1 lakh fresh cases in 2010-11 to 1.5 lakh cases in 2013-14. Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also saw a sharp fall in the number of fresh cases reported every year. The drop in the number of fresh cases is due to the increasing awareness among the public, especially the risk-prone communities of sex workers, homosexuals and transgenders, said Bakthavatchalam A, deputy director of Association for Rural Mass India, a non-profit organization working in the health sector.READ ALSO: Barbers expose customers to HIV infection"
145,12,2014,HIV poses challenge in elimination of kala-azar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/HIV-poses-challenge-in-elimination-of-kala-azar/articleshow/45329885.cms,"PATNA: The Centre and the state government have set the target of eliminating kala-azar, also known as Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in medical parlance, by 2015. However, a study conducted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international NGO, says many a kala-azar patient are HIV positive, but are ignorant about it. Non-treatment of HIV weakens their immunity system, due to which even VL drugs do not show proper effect and are leading to relapse of VL. Incidentally, Bihar accounts for over 90% kala-azar (VL) cases in the world. The study published in an issue of an international journal, Clinical Infectious Diseases, says out of over 2,000 kala-azar patients screened in Hajipur, 117 were HIV positive. Only 68 of them had prior knowledge of it. The prevalence of VL-HIV was much higher in males (71.4%) than females (28.6%). It may be mentioned here that another study published in August 2014 in Public Library of Science (PLOS) had said that estimated chances of VL relapse in HIV positive people was over 25% after three years of treatment of kala-azar. The mortality rate of VL-HIV cases are also high. Even after four years of treatment of VL, 30% HIV-VL patients could not survive. There are also a couple of studies to suggest that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive had bettered the results of VL treatment too. These figures should be alarming because, according to an estimate, over 3 lakh people have HIV/AIDS in Bihar. The PLOS study says that the risk of developing VL in HIV positive people is 100-2300 times higher compared to non-HIV people. It added, “Screening for VL in HIV cases living in VL-endemic areas must also be encouraged.” Experts say HIV test must become a part of protocol to treat VL. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) had been assigned the task of developing guidelines to this effect in the road map released to eliminate VL by the then Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan. While the state government still awaits any such guidelines, state programme officer M P Sharma said, “As of now, there is no plan to include HIV testing in the VL treatment protocol. At present, we are concentrating on the guidelines given by the Centre.” There is another issue of dosage of drugs. Recently, AmBisome (single dose treatment for VL) was launched in the state. However, experts say single dosage does not work well in HIV-VL patients. Dr Gaurab Mitra, who was one of the researchers of the study and works with MSF, told TOI, “Instead of giving it in one dose, we divide it into six doses. We believe and recommend the same in government protocol too.” His argument also finds support in the study mentioned in PLOS. The study, in fact, suggested that the number of follow-ups be more for HIV-VL cases than the VL ones."

The percentage of people within the country suffering from the disease, however, is 0.78%. In the decade between 2001 and 2011, there was a reduction of 57% in HIV prevalence in the country which is looked upon as a big success by the global community, said deputy director general of National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) Dr Sunil Khaparde. He was in the city to deliver Dr DG Gan oration during the annual conference of Indian Academy of Paediatics, Nagpur on ‘elimination of parent to child transmission of HIV and syphilis’. In accordance with the goals of United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS or UNAIDS, India is also aiming for ‘Zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination, zero AIDS-related deaths’. Dr Khaparde is optimistic about these goals being achieved in the years to come. “Initially, parent to child transmission (PPTC) was the cause of 27% of new HIV cases, which was brought down to 7% through various targeted interventions. At present, this rate is 1%. Every year, there is a cohort population of 29 million women we wish would undergo testing for HIV and syphilis. Unfortunately, due to healthcare not being accessible to all, not even half of this population is covered,” he said. The problems in the way of universal HIV testing of pregnant women include the infrastructure and staff being unavailable at levels below the district. “We are trying to tackle this problem by training nurses, non-medical staff and, if possible, even accredited social health activists (ASHA), in villages to test and counsel all pregnant women. Efforts are also being made to scale up programmes and infrastructure at community health centres and primary health centres with the aim of reaching all possible pregnant mothers in time,” said Dr Khaparde. As most other health issues, better treatment of HIV also requires contribution of the society. “We see that even today, there is many stigmas attached to the infection, from the general community and sometimes even healthcare professionals, that several patients hesitate to ask for help. On the level of governance, we have done much awareness generation,” he said. Dr Khaparde adds that the ministry of health and family welfare has even enlisted the help of other relevant ministries like education, social welfare, industry, etc to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS."

Tri-Dot test is done and the man is declared HIV positive. On being informed about his HIV status, the shocked man goes into a state of acute depression and even attempts suicide. Concerned over his condition, his family took him to a psychiatrist. On the advice of the shrink, his family then took him to a government ICTC (Integrated counselling and testing centre) for a HIV re-testing. This time, much to the relief of everyone, the man is found HIV negative. But it was only after enduring the trauma for a month. District medical and health officials said despite the government mandate of conducing three tests for confirming HIV positive cases, most private centres conduct a single test, which can be misleading as it is done without pre- and post-test counselling. “There have also been cases where people committed suicide or were taken ill after being declared HIV positive. Thanks to the single test carried out in most private centres for HIV testing, which often leads to wrong diagnosis,” stated Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy). “To confirm whether a person is HIV positive, a series of three blood tests need to be done in half-an-hour, including Coombs, SD bioline and Sigma tests. There are also other types of test kits such as Quickcheck, Elisa, Western Blot Tests as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). However, most private centres furnish reports after conducting a single test (Tri Dot test), which is not foolproof and people end up being declared HIV positive when they are not. Such wrong diagnosis can lead to disastrous consequences,” said Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who specialises in HIV/AIDS. “Moreover,patients are also not given pre-test and post-test counselling, which is an integral part of HIV testing. Triple drug ART regime is also skipped in some private centres and a single drug regime is given. Also, the private centres charge Rs 500 for this single test, which is done free-of-cost at the ICTCs and charge Rs 6000 for the ART drugs per month, which again is supplied to patients free of cost by the government. Monthly, on an average, around 10,000 HIV testing is done in government centres in the district besides the tests undertaken by private centres, which goes unrecorded,” said Dr Ramesh. “Another challenge in the treatment of HIV/AIDS is that patients turn up at the last moment when they have no option but to be administered ART (anti-retroviral drugs). They visit quacks,” added Dr Ramesh. "

The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) is taking measures to increase the number of tests for HIV among pregnant women. 	There are 20% home births where they don’t lend an ear to the need of getting tested for HIV. According to health department officials, the institutional deliveries have increased significantly up to 80% but still 20% remain home-based deliveries. 	An RSACS official said, “In institutional deliveries, the chances of HIV transmission from mother to child reduces to 2-3% if universal precaution of delivery and proper medicines to prevent the transmission of HIV are taken. Also, such mothers should not breastfeed their babies.” 	There are 18 lakh pregnancies reported every year in the state. In 2013-14, RSACS tested 4.68 lakh pregnant women for HIV with their consent. Among them, 412 were tested positive for HIV and there was a risk of transmission from mother to child. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86 lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV. 	Three years have passed but a 25-year-old Usha’s (name changed) tears still trickle down when she remembers the moment her newly born baby was declared tested positive for HIV. 	She was a resident of Jharkhand before she was married to a resident of the city. “I came to know that I am HIV positive at the time of my son’s birth. He was born in a government hospital in Jaipur three years ago. When doctors tested him for HIV, they informed me that he is born with HIV infection. Now, like me, he is also taking medicines for the infection,” said Usha on the eve of World AIDS Day. She added that she could not even breastfed her baby like other mothers as doctors had asked her not to do so. 	Usha’s case highlights vertical transmission of HIV from mother to baby at a time when there are medicines available which could reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to baby during child birth. 	Besides, Sunita (name changed), a 35-year-old woman living with HIV also narrated the same story. She said that her first child, a girl is HIV positive and she came to know that her husband and she – both were HIV positive during their first child birth. “My five-year-old daughter is HIV positive like my husband and me. But, I am happy for my son as he does not have this disease. The doctors had him tested for HIV after his birth but he is HIV negative because I took some medicines to prevent the vertical transmission,” said Sunita, who is one of those HIV positive women, who had gathered at Statue Circle in Jaipur on the eve of World AIDS Day.

Such HIV positive women from different parts of the state gathered at Statue Circle on the eve of World AIDS Day to raise their 11-point demands for welfare. 	One of these women said, “There are care homes for women, destitute children and elderly but there is no care home for single women living with HIV. We demand a care home for such women.” She added that the government should construct a care home under the social security schemes on priority basis. 	They also demanded that they should be given pension as financial assistance. “My husband, a truck drive, who is also HIV positive, left me. I am now living with my mother but I do not have any financial security now,” said one of the women gathered at Statue Circle. 	Sushila Mordiya, founder director, Positive Women Network of Rajasthan, said after being tested positive for HIV women’s lives become a challenge as it is a social taboo too. “HIV jeopardizes their life not only socially but also financially. There are incidents when a woman faces discrimination in her own house. So, such people need proper care for their rehabilitation,” said Mordiya. 	They also demanded that there should be free journey for them in Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation as they need to travel frequently for medicines and treatment. These women also said that since under Right to Education Act there is a provision for admission of students from poor background in private schools in Class I, there should be also be provision for the admission of their children in other classes too as per educational qualification. They also claimed that the HIV positive children should be given free higher education. All these women held a meeting at Statue Circle and demanded that their rehabilitation should be done properly.

Anti-HIV crusaders fear that substandard quality of free condoms alone can push up HIV prevalence. Over the last few months, cash-strapped NGOs and community-based organisations (CBO) have raised the issue of inferior quality condoms with government agencies. A Malad-based CBO has often written to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), that inferior quality of condoms has rendered its distribution among transgenders useless. “Our workers are ridiculed for distributing condoms, which lack proper lubrication,” said Gauri Sawant of the CBO. Quality assumes importance in Mumbai which has nearly 2.50lakh people in the high-risk zone and vulnerable to contract the infection. “Condom distribution is key to curbing infection among men having sex with men and female sex workers,” said Ashok Row Kavi founder of Humsafar Trust. “Super-lubricated condoms are not that useful. We must provide regular condoms with extra lubrication,” he said. While NGOs are supposed to get 80% of condom supply from NACO, they are expected to forge ties with manufacturers to arrange for the remaining 20%. NGOs say due to payment issues they hardly manage to get private firms interested in supplying them. For NGOs working with female sex workers, it becomes a dual challenge. “It takes a lot of persuasion for a sex worker to convince a client to use a condom. The least NACO can ensure is to provide good quality condoms,” said a CBO working with female sex workers. NACO refused knowledge of quality concerns. “There have been problems with supply, which will be streamlined soon. But we haven’t been told of quality issues,” said a senior official. "

In HIV transmission, where safety is the only prevention, unsafe use of syringes/needles or unconscious prick is making people fall prey to the virus. Accidental or unsafe needle prick in past six years has spread the deadly virus in nearly 1,200 people in Madhya Pradesh. The figure is just an indication how fast the virus is spreading as only few reach to hospitals and are able to confirm the infection source. According to MP State AIDS Control Society (MPSACS), till October 2014, unsafe needle/syringe use has infected 115 people in state, which is expected to rise as year 2014-15 has yet four months to complete. Though there is no steep rise or decline in number of HIV positive patients in the state since 2008, every year over 100 people get infected due to unsafe needle/syringe prick. District Nodal Officer (AIDS), Dr Vijay Chajjlani said, “Every year people get the virus in their body due to syringes/needles. Many of them do not even know that they have been infected. It comes as a shock for many, when medical investigations diagnose them HIV positive. Few are able to realize whether it was due to needle or blood transfusion when there is no history of unsafe sex.” He suggested health care providers and general population to use fresh syringe/needle each time."

AIDS patients must be outspoken and see to it that they get every facility to lead whatever life is left with them,” Gyan says talking to TOI as he is busy preparing for rally that he will lead on Monday to mark the World AIDS day. His office is confined to a dingy building at Mahendroo. Gyan was leading a happy married life till September 2000 in Bhikhna Pahari and was engaged in the business of gemstones. He met with a severe accident in the same year. “I was hospitalised in a government hospital and discharged after 15 days But I started falling ill pretty often after that,” says Gyan. AIDS, says Gyan, was probably developed there but he was unaware. Skin started becoming dead and blisteres developed. In the meantime, he donated blood for his friend. After 15 days of donation, he got a letter saying he should contact ART centre. “I did not know about the ART centre. When I went there, the banners talking about AIDS made me realise what could be the impending disaster in my life,” Gyan says. Both he and his wife gave samples. “The ground slipped beneath our feet when we got the report. Me and my wife went to complete oblivion for 15 days,” he says while recounting his nightmare. They were advised not to bear kids. “We had earlier planned for a test tube baby since my wife had certain complications. The semen was deposited and Rs 2 lakh was deposited at a centre in Kolkata. We shelved that plan,” Gyan said On the sixteenth day, his father sent the couple for a CD4 test to Delhi. Following this, their medication started. Gyan wrapped up his business. In 2006, came the first high point. “My child was born and today he is six years old and leading a healthy life,” says Gyan. However, he met with the first resistance when he decided to join an NGO working for the rights of AIDS patients. “They wondered about my finances. But I needed a reason to live.” says Gyan Gyan is today the president of BNP. He has the support of Bihar State Aids Control Society, Plan India and other NGOs and “manages his salary on project basis.” Today, his organisation has a total staff of 58 people, 80% of whom are HIV positive. Every staff member is a story unto himself/herself. "
155,12,2014,Rural areas lack HIV testing facilities,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/Rural-areas-lack-HIV-testing-facilities/articleshow/45339059.cms,"AGRA: The basic AIDS counselling and diagnostic facilities still continue to be a far cry for the rural population in the district. Not a single community health centre (CHC) or primary health centre (PHC) in the district has AIDS/HIV testing facility or an integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC). Lack of ICTCs is one of the biggest reasons why a majority of HIV patients still go undetected, especially the rural areas. There are a total of 16 CHCs in Agra district and 29 PHCs in the rural areas. Only the CHCs have a counsellors but do not have testing or diagnostic facilities. As a result, people have to come to Agra for treatment. The city has just two places where the facilities are available. Talking to TOI, a health department official said, “If you check the data of HIV and AIDS patients in the city, you will find that a majority of them hail from rural blocks. They usually come to know that they are HIV+ or suffering AIDS by accident. Those who have minimum awareness about the disease come for treatment while hundreds of others die without knowing what they were suffering from every year. The only reason is that HIV and AIDS counselling and testing is out of their reach.” He pointed out that in Etawah district a large number of HIV and AIDS cases were detected over the past two years because several ICTCs have been opened in rural blocks. He added that though Etawah is a small place with a small population as against Agra and Lucknow, round 50% of its health institutions have ICTC centres there. “There is no denying that AIDS counselling and testing services are still defunct in many of the identified 24x7 CHCs and PHCs in the city. But if patient shows any of the symptoms like HIV and AIDS, he/she is immediately referred to district hospitals for treatment and tests,” said HS Dhanu, CMO. He said there is a huge shortage of trained manpower at all the CHCs and PHCs, hence getting a separate “There is a proposed plan to upgrade the CHCs and PHCs. Even the government is planning to rope in a skilled workforce like technicians and counsellors, either permanently or on contract, to streamline the functioning. The project is in the pipeline but God knows when it will happen,” added the CMO. "
156,12,2014,"87% unaware of HIV+ status, may be infecting others",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/87-unaware-of-HIV-status-may-be-infecting-others/articleshow/45340879.cms,"NEW DELHI: As many as 87% of HIV-infected people are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus, according to government data. Estimates by National Aids Control Organization (NACO), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus. “The low level of awareness among HIV positive population is of concern because research shows that early diagnosis is crucial. It allows patients to start on treatment sooner, which can greatly reduce the risk of spreading the infection to partners. Detecting the virus early also improves health outcomes for infected patients,” said Gerald Schochetman, senior director, Infectious Diseases and Diagnostic Research, Abbott. Government officials as well as health experts say the risk is more among the vulnerable population that practises high risk behaviour or have higher chances of HIV prevalence. This includes sex workers, trans-genders and even long-distance truckers. Over the years, counselling and testing centres across the country have increased with many private laboratories now offering HIV detection tests apart from the government centres. In 1997, there were just 67 HIV testing and counselling sites in India, whereas NACO data shows there over 15,000 healthcare facilities offering counselling and testing across the country in 2014. “Counselling and testing services are important components of prevention and control of AIDS in the country,” said Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective. Grover said instead of cutting corners with the vulnerable population by criminalizing them, government should counsel and provide them with proper care so that they do not transmit the disease further. “In the past few years, the number of infections has declined in India because we worked with the vulnerable population, distributed condoms and made them aware. One needs to partner them so that they help in not increasing the burden,” Grover said. The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world. There are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients. "

Organized by the West Bengal Brihannala Unnayan Samity, the statewide umbrella organization for transgenders, the marchers were joined by NGO activists as well as people from the mainstream of life. 	Setting out from the samity’s headquarters in Howrah’s Bankra, the procession marched across Howrah town and beyond it to different parts of the district. The participants distributed leaflets among pedestrians as well as bus and auto passengers. They also organized a counseling session on AIDS from a booth set up in front of the Howrah Municipal Corporation headquarters. The transgenders at the booth were seen advising people against using syringes unless taken out of sealed packs and creating awareness against unprotected sex. 	Samity secretary Dipa Banerjee said, “We consider transgenders an integral and important part of society. Hence, we hit the streets to do our bit on World AIDS Day. The samity has a record of helping people suspected of suffering from AIDS by taking them to government hospitals for tests. We have also treated 200 HIV+ patients. We are happy that our rally drew people from what is considered the mainstream of society.” 	At Tangra in Kolkata, Dhumketu Puppet Theatre — a registered organization of song and drama division (government of India) — organized a puppet show to raise awareness on AIDS.

At some places, an awareness camp was conducted while at others street plays were organised to spread the message of wiping out the disease from the country. At a camp organised in the outpatient department of GSVM medical college, Dr Navneet Kumar, principal of the college said that globally around 3.5 crore people are suffering from the the deadly virus, out of which Uttar Pradesh contributes to 1,60,000 patients. “Every year about 27 lakh new people are added to the list of sufferers all around the world. To cater to the needs of such patients, government has come with a lot of schemes. The medicines and treatment is available for free at the Antiretroviral therapy (ART) Centre situated in the city. Also, free medical assistance is provided to the suffers in all departments of the hospital,” he said. Talking about epidemiology of HIV/AIDS ART Centres, Dr BP Priyadarshini, Nodal officer ART Centre, said that the country has been fighting with the disease from the past 28 years. He said that it is a chronic manageable disease. “There are total 680 ART Centres in the country. States like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra have maximum number of HIV patients. From 2010, when the centre was opened in the city, we have registered about 4,400 patients, out of which 2,900 are being provided with free medicines,” he said. Meanwhile, District Tuberculosis Control (DTC) centre also organised various activities to mark the day. An inter-college ‘Street lay’ competition was organised to spread awareness among the youngsters as well to the society. “HIV/AIDS sufferers are at high risk of developing TB. Therefore, it is important that they know about the precautions that should be taken to prevent the disease. Our main motive behind organising the competition was to create awareness among the youth”, Dr. Anil Kumar Saxena, DTO, said. Local NGOs also came forward in making the society aware about the preventive measures to be taken to check the spread of the disease. An Etawah based NGO took out a rally from DTO office at Parade area to Ursula Hospital. A signature campaign was also organised by the NGO at LLR hospital premises.

HIV is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, according to a major scientific study led by British scientists. The team at the University of Oxford has shown that it was taking longer for HIV infection to cause AIDS. The rapid evolution of HIV, which has allowed the virus to develop resistance to patients’ natural immunity is at the same time slowing the virus’s ability to cause AIDS. The study also indicates that people infected by HIV are likely to progress to AIDS more slowly — in other words the virus becomes less virulent — because of widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both processes make an important contribution to the overall goal of the control and eradication of the HIV epidemic. Scientists said: “Twenty years ago the time to AIDS was 10 years, but in the last 10 years in Botswana that might have increased to 12.5 years. One might imagine as time extends this could stretch further and further and in the future people being asymptomatic for decades.” In 2013, there were a total of 35 million people living with HIV worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The study was led by researchers at the University of Oxford, along with scientists from South Africa, Canada, Tokyo, Harvard University and Microsoft Research.Schoolgirls take part in an HIV/AIDS awareness rally on World AIDS Day at a School in Patiala, on December 1, 2014.READ ALSO: Four south Indian states make up 50% of HIV cases Lead scientist Professor Phillip Goulder from the University of Oxford, said: “This research highlights the fact that HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate. Anything we can do to increase the pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of HIV over time.”Bill Clinton, former US president, addresses the crowd at a musical concert organized to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS on World AIDS day in New York City, on December 1, 2014. The research was carried out in Botswana and South Africa, two countries that have been worst affected by the HIV epidemic. Across those countries, researchers enrolled over 2000 women with chronic HIV infection to take part in the study. The first part of the study looked at whether the interaction between the body’s natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent.READ ALSO: Medicines, test kit scarcity hits HIV therapy in India Central to this investigation are proteins in our blood called the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which enable the immune system to differentiate between the human body's proteins and the proteins of pathogens. People with a gene that expresses a particular HLA protein called HLA-B57, are known to benefit from a protective effect to HIV. Infected patients with the HLA-B57 gene progress more slowly than usual to AIDS.College and Schoolstudents hold a giant red ribbon made by themselves during an event to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS on the World AIDS Day, in Fuyang, China, on December 1, 2014. This study showed that in Botswana, where HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B57 more than in South Africa, patients no longer benefit from this gene’s protective effect. However, the team’s data show that the cost of this adaptation to HIV is that its ability to replicate is significantly reduced, therefore making the virus less virulent. The authors show that viral adaptation to protective gene variants, such as HLA-B57, is driving down the virulence of transmitted HIV and is thereby contributing to HIV elimination. In the second part of the study the authors examined the impact of ART on HIV virulence. They developed a mathematical model, which concluded that selective treatment of people with low CD4 counts will accelerate the evolution of HIV variants with a weaker ability to replicate."

In Mysuru district alone, they have detected 725 cases. In Mysuru district, about 14,000 HIV positive patients are registered at the three centres and 5,500 people are undergoing treatment, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) officer Dr T Raghukumar said here on Monday. Speaking at a World AIDS Day event at JSS Nursing College, he said more patients are visiting the ART Centres for treatment due to awareness among public on HIV. Patients, including from neighbouring districts, have been undergoing treatment in the ART centres at Krishna Rajendra Hospital, Asha Kirana Hospital and JSS Hospital. Till October end this year, the centres tested 51,728 people, 776 of whom tested positive. Out of the 30,112 pregnant women tested, 37 were detected with HIV, he added. Treating pregnant women The centres are treating HIV positive pregnant women with a CD-4 cell count of 350 plus. The anti-retroviral course begins in the 14th week of pregnancy and goes on till they stop breast feeding. Besides, tests are conducted on infants four times till they reach 18 months of age, a doctor said. To create awareness among students, the DAPCU has set up 70 red ribbon clubs in pre-university and degree colleges in the district and 13 blood banks are functioning across the district.Public care can help them live longer HIV patients feel they can live long if they get proper care, love and affection from society. They also feel that self confidence plays a major role in it. Kantaraju, a HIV patient who runs an NGO, said patients must have self-confidence. Kantharaju, who tested HIV positive in 2008, runs 'Ananda Jyoti' to helps others get proper treatment and benefits from the government. He said the government has been providing free treatment for HIV positive people. Pointing out that nutritious food is as important as treatment and medicines, Kantaraju urged the government to offer free food for patients as many belong to poor and backward families. Another HIV patient from Hunsur, who did not wish to reveal her name, said, ""Though we did not know how we got affected, many look at us as if we had done something horrible. I have lost all hopes in life. I am living only for my children."" She was detected with HIV in 2010, and has undergoing treatment at the ART Centre at Krishnarajendra Hospital since then. ""If people like me get moral support from neighbours, we can lead a normal happy life,"" she added. "

But, what’s bothering doctors and counsellors working with people living with HIV/AIDS is the casual attitude of the infected persons. Despite counselling, many don’t take any precautions and pass on the infection to his/her partner. The ART (anti-retroviral therapy) center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, receives many such cases. At the end of the day, the staff members find themselves exasperated when a new case of HIV is detected, and the source of infection is one of the patients taking treatment at the center. “And we wonder whether we are doing any good to the society. We help them get well, and they go out and spread infection,” said a ART staff member who recently dealt with a case of a 24-year-old man, who gave infection to his wife. When he walked in the center a year ago, he was thoroughly counselled along with his mother and told not to get married. “Not only did he marry a HIV negative girl, but within a year had his 19-year-old wife infected, and now he wants to have a child too,” said a ART member. “I wanted somebody to take care of my son,” was the mother‘s lame excuse when questioned about her son's marriage. The staff at the ART center has tried its best to dissuade him from having a child, but he is adamant. “We have even told him that the baby may be born HIV positive. But you know, what he said? ‘You people will cure him’. The staff member said she was infuriated when he heard him say that. A counsellor said, “It’s not that all don’t listen, but then there’s no way we can do anything other than telling them what they should and should not do.” “When we counsel them, they hear us with rapt attention. When we ask whether they will follow our instructions, they answer in the affirmative. But some chose to defy us,” she adds. She also said that some of the commercial sex workers who visit the ART center to collect their regular dose of medicines, have been spotted by them soliciting customers. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS), said this type of attitude is evident among HIV/AIDS patients as they want to prove to others that they are normal. “They want to also hide their infection also because of stigma attached to HIV/AIDs,” she said further adding they are doing all they can do to generate awareness about HIV/AIDS."

Take this for instance. The Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) has so far carried out 17 deliveries both normal and caesarean on HIV-infected women. The number of was high in 2013-14 with 41 babies, according to a statistics available with the District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), Trichy. The number of babies born to HIV-infected women in the hospital is as follows (year-wise) - 37 in 2012-13, 65 in 2011-12, 66 in 2010-11 and 112 in 2009-10. Dr M Nagamani, obstetrics and gynaecologist in Trichy, said doctors have a sense of satisfaction for carrying out baby deliveries on HIV-infected women. ""Once we get to know that the patient is HIV-infected, we take precaution to ensure protection for us at the delivery room. At the same time, we get a sense of satisfaction in providing medical care to such people,"" said Dr Nagamani. District collector Jayashree Muralidharan advised the women to keep tab on their partners while speaking at the function organised on World Aids Day. She appreciated the doctors of MGMGH for their noble service. ""The prevention of AIDS could not be achieved by the government alone but it needs the cooperation from people as well. Women suffer a lot because of the misconduct of men. So, women should always keep vigil on their husbands,"" said the collector. R Senthilkumar, district programme manager (DPM) of DAPCU, said, ""Gone are the days when some of the doctors hesitated to treat HIV patients. Nowadays, many doctors have dedicated themselves in providing treatment to those patients despite having risk of transmission during operation. It is because of the doctors in government hospital, we could help HIV-infected pregnant woman to safely deliver a baby,"" said Senthilkumar. "

A recent study conducted by Dr Yogesh Marfatia, head of SSG Hospital’s department of skin and venereal diseases, shows that the major reason of the virus still being transmitted is its late detection in carriers. “Awareness has reached a lot of people and the percentage increase has reduced comparatively in the last 15 years. Some regions in the country continue to record a large number of HIV cases, which is why the national average still shows a positive trend on a graph. Until the national average comes to stagnation, a reverse trend is almost impossible. The migration of citizens will continue to spread the infection,” said Marfatia. According to Dr Mohammed Hussain, who handles HIV patients at SSG Hospital, transmission of the virus still continues at considerable rate. “There still remains a section across the social strata of the population that do not go for regular check-ups. HIV virus can stay in the human body without causing any trouble for years, but the infection can be transmitted to another person,” he added. The study conducted by Marfatia suggests that nearly 68 per cent of spouses get infected because the disease was never detected in their partners. “Heterosexual intercourse is the commonest route of HIV transmission in India. The unaffected spouse could incur the infection for two basic reasons – either the infected person is unaware of the infection or the infected person deliberately hides the information,” added Marfatia. Sixty-six HIV positive patients and their partners from in and around the city were studied during the research project. The study concluded showed that unprotected sex between spouses remains a major cause of HIV transmission. “The transmission of HIV and AIDS due to blood transfusion or reused syringe has gone down to almost zero per cent. Multiple sex partners and unprotected sex remains the major cause now. People have to understand that regular check-ups and discussing about AIDS can solve the problem to a great extent,” Marfatia said. "

She and her children have been rendered homeless for the last two weeks with the administration choosing to look the other way till rights activists took up the matter and brought it to media glare on Saturday. Earlier, local people had allegedly drove her husband to commit suicide by taunting him repeatedly for his HIV Positive status and threatening eviction. A “nexus” between local landsharks, the councillor’s husband and the former land owner of the house allegedly conspired to evict the woman by instigating neighbours to banish the “morally corrupt” woman from the area. She and her children were dragged out of the house on November 23 and the door was padlocked. The trio has since been spending the nights either at a railway platform or with relatives who allowed them only one night’s stay. The woman has been running from pillar to post in search of help from the administration, only to be refused everywhere. “I told police officials everything and requested them to make an arrangement for my children and me to return home. But, nobody took the matter seriously. With my emergency medicines lying in the locked home, I tried to gain entrance to access them but was threatened, abused and assaulted, which forced me to leave the spot,” the widow told TOI while recounting her horror story on Saturday. It was only after she managed to get in touch with activists of South 24-Parganas Network for People Living with HIV+, a non-government organization, that she received some support. Members of the NGO accompanied her to Belghoria police station and lodged a complaint. The woman also met the North 24-Parganas district magistrate on Friday and sought her intervention. The widow lived in a house on Abbas Ali Lane, Dakshineswar, with her two sons. The elder one is 14-year-old and studies in Class IX, while the younger one is six-year-old and a student of Class II. The house is in ward No. 13 of Kamarhati Municipality. Her husband, who was a grocer, had committed suicide in May after being hounded by neighbours following the HIV Positive diagnosis during tests prior to a brain tumor operation. The woman was thereafter asked to undergo a check and she too tested positive. “After the initial shock, I took it bravely and went through the entire process of medication and counselling at RG Kar Hospital. I decided to keep my condition under wraps when doctors said we could lead a normal life under medication and care. I looked forward to life as my two sons were not infected. But, my husband could not take the torture by neighbours and committed suicide on May 17,” the widow recounted. The woman’s ordeal took a turn for the worse with former land owner Amit Das, Laltu Bose (husband of Mithu Bose, the TMC councillor of ward No. 13 of Kamarhati Municipality) and their associates allegedly driving the family out of the house. The victim’s husband had purchased the 1.5 cottah land from Das and constructed a single-storey house there. “The local councilor’s husband and his associates threatened and abused us as well. We knocked on the doors of several administration officials, including local police officers, SDO and DM, seeking action against the accused. But nothing has happened till now,” said Sebika Chowdhury, co-coordinator of the NGO. Khitish Mondal, the president of the NGO who took the woman to the DM’s office, said, “We could not meet the DM. But his secretary assured us of action.” Laltu Bose, the husband of the councilor, refuted the allegation leveled against him and launched a tirade against the woman, accusing her character. “I was falsely implicated,” Bose said. Kamarhati MLA and transport minister Madan Mitra said, “I have asked to the Kamarhati Municipality chairman to give a detailed report in this connection.” DC-DD of Barrackpore commissionerate Ajay Thakur said, “We are looking into the matter seriously.”"

However, as HIV-1 has a unique ability to lie dormant for years, the virus-affected cells will have to be continuously monitored to plan the treatment. So, here comes a non-invasive biosensor that can measure what is going on within HIV-1 infected cells in real time, all thanks to a joint research by teams from IISc here and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology (ICGEB) and Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. Scientists said that the technology can offer insights that can help in controlling AIDS infection and also provide insight on interactions between HIV-1 and the tuberculosis causing bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),within the cells. The team has devised a non-invasive biosensor methodology for precise measurements of glutathione (GHS), an anti-oxidant which works as a protective shield. Glutathione levels are indicators of the level of infection. The team says fluctuation of GSH levels detected by the biosensor also helps understand the expression of antioxidant genes and related pathways during latent and active stages of infection. “Earlier methods use whole cell or tissue extracts, which destroy detailed information related to the GSH levels in different areas within an infected cell. We’ve discovered that a modest increase in oxidative stress is sufficient to reactivate virus from latency. This may allow researchers to adopt a ‘shock-and-kill’ strategy in which virus could be reactivated by oxidative stress inducing compounds and subsequently killed by current anti-HIV drugs,” the team’s study says. Amit Singh of IISc says the sensitivity and specificity of this biosensor could be further used in understanding the physiological changes in HIV-1 infected cells and the mechanism of drug action. Importantly, he says, “We also discovered that Mycobacterium tuberculosis, another major human pathogen, specifically disturbs glutathione balance to increase the replication of HIV. Since TB is the major cause of HIV related deaths, our findings have major mechanistic and therapeutic potential for both TB and AIDS (among the main causes of human death).” According to information from the ministry of health and family welfare, Karnataka has 1,07,664 AIDS patients and 6,751 of them are below the age of 15 (see table).

169,12,2014,Cops escort HIV+ widow home,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Cops-escort-HIV-widow-home/articleshow/45440898.cms,"KOLKATA: A 34-year-old HIV-positive widow and her two children, who were rendered homeless for the last two weeks after being socially ostracized, were escorted back to their Dakshineswar home by the administrative officials on Tuesday afternoon — two days after the report on their ordeal was published in the Times of India on Sunday. After the TOI report revealed the trauma she had to undergo with the local police choosing to look the other way, the state transport minister and MLA from Kamarhati Madan Mitra, district magistrate of North 24-Parganas Sanjay Bansal and Kamarhati municipality chairman Gopal Saha took action to escort them back home. The activists of South 24-Parganas Network for People Living with HIV+, a non-government organization, including its president Khitish Mondal and coordinator Sebika Chowdhury, first took up the matter and brought it to media glare on Saturday. They also accompanied the widow and her sons on Tuesday to their house. The widow lived in a house on Abbas Ali Lane in Dakshineswar with her two sons. While her elder son is 14-year-old and studies in Class IX, the younger one is six-year-old and a student of Class II. Her husband, who was a grocer, had committed suicide in May after being hounded by neighbours following the HIV Positive diagnosis during tests prior to a brain tumour operation. The woman was thereafter asked to undergo a check and she too tested positive. The widow’s ordeal had taken a turn for the worse after a group of local landsharks allegedly conspired to evict the woman by instigating her neighbours. On November 23, she and her children were dragged out of their house and the door was locked from outside by some locals. The trio had been spending the nights on railway platforms since then. The woman was running from the pillar to post in search of help from the administration, only to be refused everywhere. She, accompanied by the NGO activists, then knocked on the doors of the local police station seeking their help. But, nobody took the matter seriously, till the TOI report brought to light the plight of the widow on Sunday. After returning to her residence on Tuesday, the woman heaved a sigh of relief and expressed her gratitude to TOI, the NGO activists, the minister and others who took helped her. “I suffered a lot along with my sons. I almost lost hope to return to my home. On Tuesday, the officials not only made arrangement for my safe return, they also asked my neighbours not to bother me anymore,” the woman told TOI. Gopal Saha said, “After I came to know about her plight, I sent the concerned officials of the civic body to look into the matter. We also tried to spread awareness against the social ostracism of a HIV+ while talking to the locals on Tuesday. Minister Madan Mitra also instructed me to take an immediate action for her safe return,” Saha told TOI."

The court, however, acquitted his girlfriend and mother for lack of adequate evidence. In her complaint filed in 2012, the woman, a resident of Sirsa in Haryana, had accused her husband Sunil Kumar of Telupura village in Abohar subdivision of administering her HIV-infected saline two years ago. She said Sunil wanted to eliminate her and marry his paramour Gurvir Kaur from Moga. She had married Sunil in March 2006 before he went to study laboratory technician course in Bathinda, where he fell in love with his classmate Gurvir. She asked him to divorce his wife when she learned that he was already married. However, his wife, who had been blessed with a baby girl by then, refused divorce. Sunil and Gurvir then hatched a plot to eliminate her. They stole a sample of HIV-infected blood from a laboratory and he injected it while administering saline to his unwell wife. The complainant said she had noticed that the saline was red in colour and pointed it out to her husband, but he told her it was laced with some anti-biotic drugs. Her condition deteriorated and Sunil did not take her to a doctor. Her father took her to a private hospital in Sirsa, where her blood samples were taken for clinical tests. The doctors diagnosed her as HIV infected and referred her to PGI, Chandigarh, for treatment. She lost her vision during the course of treatment. She lodged a complaint after she was referred to PGI. On the basis of a probe by the doctors, a case was registered against Sunil and his paramour. Not satisfied with the quantum of punishment, her father said the accused deserved capital punishment. ""We will appeal in the high court to enhance the punishment and also challenge the acquittal of the other two accused in the case,"" he said. "

He was a resident of Dindoli area of the city. He was found hanging from the ceiling fan of a special room on the fourth floor of the hospital. He took his life when his wife went out of the room for some work in the morning. His wife alerted the hospital authorities on finding him hanging from the ceiling fan. He had used his wife's sari as a noose. The man was admitted to SMIMER Hospital on November 28. He was under treatment for HIV for the past seven years. The woman informed police that her husband was depressed because of his illness and thus may have committed suicide. The deceased was a labourer but was jobless for the past few weeks. ""His family members said the deceased was depressed because of his illness. We are collecting more details about the deceased and his family as a part of our investigation,"" said V D Vala, police inspector, Varachha police station. ""There are many reasons for a HIV positive patient to become depressed. It could be unending treatment and lack of family support. Family members should spend more time with such patients to check development of suicidal tendencies in them,"" said Daksha Patel, secretary, Gujarat State Network of Positive People (GSNP+)."
174,12,2014,Only 24% of parents with HIV disclose health status to kids,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/articleshow/45541861.cms," CHENNAI: For years, Ramani* did not know how to tell her two teenage daughters that their father had died of AIDS and that she had contracted the HIV infection from him. She even evaded questions on the cause of their father's death until the day her 15-year-old daughter found a hospital file and asked her mother about the medicines she was taking. ""I was surprised that my daughter did not get angry. She has learnt about HIV at school. In fact, she was supportive and said she would take good care of me. She suddenly sounded all grown up when she told me not to reveal about my health status to her sister,"" Ramani said. Not many parents with HIV reveal their health status to their children. A study by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis found that only 24% of people with HIV disclosed their status to their children. The study involved interviews with 115 parents with HIV. Those who disclosed it did so only to protect their children from risky behaviour or in the hope that they would be taken care of when they fall ill. While the rest did not reveal their status to their children because they were afraid of losing respect or being treated with indifference, the study highlighted the need to teach healthcare providers to help patients with full disclosure. Only 39% were able to disclose their status by themselves; in the rest of the cases, children came to know of their parents' health condition on their own during hospital visits, reading case files or overhearing conversations between the parent and the health provider. The study said the trend was worrying as improper disclosure without clear explanations could frighten a child . Most of the disclosures were by those widowed, separated or divorced where the child would already be going through a trauma of a broken family . Disclosure was also more likely where both parents were positive. Not all children were accepting and understanding of their parents' health status. At least half of those who disclosed, witnessed angry or mixed reactions from children. One-tenth of the parents who did not disclose had children who were HIV positive, leaving them with more burden of keeping even their child's status under wraps that can be detrimental to the psychosocial well being of parents and their children *(Name changed) ""Anti-retroviral treatment reduces morbidity and mortality and disclosure becomes significant as positive parents are more likely to raise their children for many years. However, HIV programmes do not address the psycho-social concern regarding disclosure,"" said Beena Thomas, scientist, NIRT. ""Disclosure is important for emotional and social support and better quality of life. Once the disclosure is made, children need to be equipped to deal with the status through periodic interventions and counselling. Apart from inclusion of disclosure support services in HIV intervention programmes, children need to be sensitized early to accept it without discrimination and need to be prepared as they are the best ambassadors to pass the message to their parents.""

Between April and October this year, 68,232 people got themselves tested for HIV in Thane district and of them, 1,410 were tested positive. The density in Bhiwandi was high, as of the 2,064 people who underwent tests, 198 tested positive, revealed a study by the State AIDS Control Society (SACS). This is also the highest density of HIV positive patients in Thane district, said health officials. Experts cited lack of awareness among migrant and labour population in the township to be responsible for the numbers. Ulhasnagar was second with 5.33% of 4,428 people tested positive for HIV. Thane showed a meagre rate of 1.93%, while Navi Mumbai recorded 2.34%. Mokhada registered the lowest figure with only one out of 1,359 people testing positive between April and September. SACS officials said they will start more programmes. “The city has a high labour population. Also, there are a number of red-light areas in industrial zones. Awareness campaigns have had little effect as most people here are migrants,” said Ratan Gadhave, programme officer, district AIDS prevention &amp; control unit, Thane. "

He was addressing the inauguration of a two-day national conference on the recent trends in nanoscience and techniques and applications associated with life sciences. Ahmed said the nanotechnology is being used to control diseases such as cancer, HIV and dental problem and also in sectors such as agriculture and energy conversion by using biological means. ""The biological methods are water soluble and non-chemical and are non toxic. They are made from endophytic fungi made from plants and mushrooms which is much safer,"" he added. Ahmed said a basic research for these nanoparticles has been done for medicinal use and no commercial research is being done for translating them into industrial applications. This will also help to tap the global market, he added. Speaking to TOI, Ahmed said that a major company based in the country has already sought technical know how about synthesis from lemon grass into their use."
