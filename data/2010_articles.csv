0,1,2010,Delhi govt to announce facilities for HIV/AIDS patients,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Delhi-govt-to-announce-facilities-for-HIV/AIDS-patients/articleshow/5421669.cms," NEW DELHI: To provide relief to HIV patients, the Delhi Government will soon announce a host of facilities like free travel in DTC buses and nutritional support to them. The decision to extend the facilities was taken at a meeting of the Delhi State AIDS Council presided over by health and family welfare minister Kiran Walia. She also launched CDs and educational kits to make people aware about the disease. Walia said HIV/AIDS patients and their attendants will be allowed to travel free on DTC buses to Anti Retroviral Therapy centres as well as to go to the hospital for checkup and treatment. Government was also considering providing BPL cards to HIV/AIDS affected persons so that they get food items at subsidised price, she said, adding her department will also take care of nutritional requirement of the affected persons. The Minister said requests have also been received to allow the patients free ride on Metro rail. For this government will take up the matter with DMRC. Walia said Government will also make available CT scan, MRI, Ultrasound and other special tests at government hospitals free of cost for such patients. "

""I am pinning all my hopes to find a genuine match on the proposed website. I want to live a life with dignity and want someone who is intelligent, sober, and caring,"" Junali told IANS. The website (www.hitchiv.com) to be launched later this month at the behest of the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+) has already generated a lot of interest among HIV- positive people. ""We have already got about 150 to 200 requests for membership despite the fact that the website is yet to be launched,"" Jahnabi Goswami, president of INP+, said. Goswami, 32, is one of the few women in India fighting to raise awareness about the disease. She belongs to an even smaller group of people who have publicly declared that they are HIV- positive. Membership to the website would be open only to people living with HIV/AIDS. ""Strict privacy would be maintained and only registered members will be able to log in and scan profiles of prospective partners,"" Goswami said. There are thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS interested in marriage and leading a normal life with dignity, but since they cannot get in touch with like-minded people, their dreams remained unfulfilled. ""It is an excellent idea to have this website as marriages between an HIV- positive couple would enable them not only to lead a happy life but also to take care of and support each other, which is very important,"" S.I. Ahmed, head of the AIDS Prevention Society, a community healthcare group in Assam, said. INP+ would arrange pre-marital counselling to prospective couples interested in having children post-marriage. ""When it comes to marriage the couple would surely be told about the pros and cons,"" Ahmed added. "
2,1,2010,Researchers hopeful of finding HIV cure,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Researchers-hopeful-of-finding-HIV-cure/articleshow/5431695.cms," CHENNAI: Researchers working towards a cure for HIV-AIDS have hit upon possibilities with true potential to transform into viable solutions in the future, said Robert T Schooley, head, division of infectious diseases, University of California, San Diego. With his previous experience as chair of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, reputedly among the most productive multinational research organizations working on HIV pathogenesis and therapy, Schooley was an important contributor to the two-day ART Symposium in the city organized by YRG Care over the weekend to discuss cutting-edge technology in the field. Speaking to TOI on Sunday about new scientific advances in the field, Schooley said, ""There are a host of approaches being adopted by researchers worldwide to try and eradicate HIV however the approaches using either enzymes or RNA to remove infected cells are ultimately the most hopeful and will be the least disruptive for the patient. Paula Cannon, a researcher from California, for instance, has been working on ways to identify HIV-infected cells called CD4 cells (so called because they have a molecule on the surface called CD4) which is a gateway for the virus. These cells have a second molecule called CCR5 which is a second door that the virus has to pass through. Now, she has created a way for the second molecule to be changed so that they virus cannot recognize it. In this approach, the virus stays outside the cell."" Elaborating on Cannon's research, he said she had been able to demonstrate it successfully in mice. ""The next step will be to take people with HIV infection who have lymphoma and so, would need a bone marrow transplant for their tumours. She would treat the stem cells and hopefully the bone marrow so grafted would afford the patients' cells protection from HIV,"" Schooley said. Pointing out that this was an experiment that had to be done, he cited the example of a similar case but with a natural modification of the CCR5 molecule being reported in the New York Journal of Medicine about 18 months ago. ""After the HIV-infected individual underwent a bone marrow transplant from such a donor, no one could demonstrate the presence of HIV in the patient. So, there is certainly some preliminary support for her research,"" he said. Commenting on India's research potential, Schooley said that biotechnology was growing at an excellent pace in the country. ""There is some state of the art research work being carried out by YRG Care and some fantastically sophisticated research at National Aids Research Institute, Pune. In fact, the component sites that we have in Chennai and Pune are among the most productive. We are carrying out trials on the best drugs to use for HIV infections, treating people with drug failure and drug resistance and treating people suffering from HIV and Tuberculosis at the same time. There is a lot of important work being carried out over here. India is one of the best places for research activity worldwide,"" he added. "
3,1,2010,"Dumped by husband, HIV+ woman seeks CM’s help",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/Dumped-by-husband-HIV-woman-seeks-CMs-help/articleshow/5434973.cms," LUCKNOW: After running from the pillar to post for an year with no positive response from any of the government and non-government organisations (NGOs), 19-year-old Poonam (name changed) as a last resort has written an open letter to the chief minister Mayawati for help. The hapless woman was thrown out by her husband after she had tested HIV+ during delivery of her baby last year. Although she got the infection from her husband but the latter refuses to keep her saying that he has no money to bear the cost of treatment. He has also kept the baby with him. “I knocked at every door possible, be it NGOs or government organisations but only got sympathies,” said Poonam while narrating how her husband snatched her four-month-old daughter from her and threw her out of the house. “With no money and means of livelihood, I first went to my parents but my father was also not ready to accept me. My mother, however, intervened and helped me in approaching various government agencies and NGOs for help. However, at all the places people only made promises but none helped,” she rued. Poonam only want a job so that she can be financially independent and can claim custody of her daughter. In her letter, Poonam has described how hundreds of HIV+ women like her who want to stand on their feet and fight stigma but are being pushed back by government agencies and NGOs who thrive on grants procured in the name of HIV/AIDS awareness and welfare. “I hope being a women chief minister will help me out,” said Poonam who signed the letter “one of your daughter”. A dejected Poonam has also said that she would be forced to commit suicide, if no help came from the chief minister. “ What option do I have...should I take to prostitution and infect others...or beg on streets... better to end life,” she said. Poonam was just 16 when she was married to one Rajesh, who works as salesman in a small firm. The marriage does not have a legal sanctity because she was minor at that time. She has studied till class XI, which is also not enough to get a job. “ I understand the limitations but I am only asking for a job, may be a peon or a counsellor at any AIDS awareness centre or any task which may earn enough to take care of myself,” she said. At present, she survives on little money her mother sends every month. During the day, she wanders on the streets looking for work and in the night finds shelter in railways and bus stations. The woman also knocked the door of the State Women Commission and State Aids Control Society as well as other NGOs working for HIV positive people but got only assurances. The episode has also exposed the poor state of affairs in government set up for providing relief and rehabilitation to abandoned HIV+ women and children. There are over 1000 NGOs, funded by the government and other national international organisations, working in the field of HIV/AIDS in UP but none have any shelter home, barring ‘Shanti Niketan’ run by the ‘Sisters of Saint Joseph’, a Christian missionary organisation, but it has limited capacity. The state has over 1.4 lakh HIV+ people, of which nearly 30% are widows who acquired infection from their husbands but after their death were disowned by in-laws. Many like Poonam are denied shelter by their parents as well. Some also have children. The only option for them is to lead a traumatised life and die in oblivion. Officers claim that government gives enough funds to the NGOs for the job. The Lucknow Network for People living with HIV and AIDS has been helping such widows but resources are limited. Members complain that NGOs take grants in the name of HIV/AIDS but have done more harm to victims than infection. "
4,1,2010,"HIV kids need better nutrition, education",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/HIV-kids-need-better-nutrition-education/articleshow/5514931.cms," BANGALORE: Nutrition, education and property rights. That's what children who are HIV positive demand from society. Better access to medical treatment and easy access to nutrition and continuation of education are among their primary demands. After a public hearing on `Child rights -- issues and entitlements of the orphan and vulnerable children affected/infected by HIV/ AIDS', Shantha Sinha, chairperson, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), said four things topped their list of demands. ""A comprehensive nutrition programme is needed. Continuation of education is a problem for most because of social stigma,"" she said. The question of property rights is another bane for these children because many are thrown out of their homes with even siblings distancing themselves. ""This is fracturing families. Also, in several cases, there are no parents and children have to take care of the family. There are no rules on these cases ought to be handled,"" she added. The national commission is also mulling over a comprehensive child health policy and on conducting such public hearing at the district level. These have been held in Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Tamil Nadu. A pilot hearing in Udupi, where the incidence of HIV/AIDS affected children is very high, is being considered. Both the national and state commissions were unanimous in saying the biggest problem was that there was no data on children affected by HIV/AIDS. However, it's estimated there are about 55,000 children orphaned due to AIDS or other reasons in just three districts of Belgaum, Bagalkot and Bellary. Guidelines not operational Though there are guidelines for children with HIV/AIDS, which have details on how to handle such cases, social workers say these are not yet operational on ground. Neither has the HIV Bill been passed. Nina P Naik, chairperson, Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said there was no plan in the state for children affected with HIV/AIDS. If parents die, the ration card for the family is cancelled and they are not considered to be below the poverty line. ""HIV positive women with a son over 18 years no longer gets a widow pension. There is also a movement nationwide to include HIV positive people under the disability pension scheme,"" she added. It's been estimated that every 15 seconds a child loses a parent to AIDS and there are about 2 million children under 15 years who are living with HIV. According to a UNAIDS 2008 report, about 15 million orphans are AIDS orphans. toiblr.reporter@timesgroup.com "
5,1,2010,"Now, a shot to prevent HIV+ getting TB",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Now-a-shot-to-prevent-HIV-getting-TB/articleshow/5518464.cms," NEW DELHI: A vaccine to protect HIV patients from contracting tuberculosis (TB) and ultimately dying of it has finally become a reality. After a seven-year-long trial in Africa, scientists have for the first time developed a vaccine that was succesful in reducing the rate of definite TB infection by almost 39% among 2,000 HIV-infected patients in Tanzania. TB is the biggest killer of HIV-infected patients in the world. In India, over 60% of HIV-infected patients with a weak immunity system get infected with TB and ultimately die of it. Scientists from Dartmouth Medical School (DMS) have reported results of their clinical trial of this new vaccine against TB -- Mycobacterium vaccae (MV) -- in the January 29 online issue of the journal AIDS. The study will be published in the March print issue of the journal. Principal investigator Ford von Reyn from DMS said, ""Since development of a new vaccine against TB is a major international health priority, especially for patients with HIV infection, we and our Tanzanian collaborators are very encouraged by the results of the study."" The vaccine is a type known as an inactivated, whole-cell mycobacterial vaccine and is expected to be economical to produce and distribute. Von Reyn described the trial as a ""significant milestone -- the first to demonstrate that any type of vaccine can prevent an infectious complication of HIV in adults"". He added that the next steps are to improve the manufacturing methods to support the production of the larger quantities of the TB vaccine needed for further studies and subsequent clinical use. Health ministry officials in Delhi say the vaccine gives tremendous hope to India which has a huge burden of both TB and HIV patients. Of the over two million HIV-infected Indians, over 10% are expected to have full blown AIDS. Every AIDS patient has 15% chance every year of developing TB, which shows that every AIDS patient will develop TB some time in his life. ""That's why under India's latest AIDS control programme, we are dealing with TB and HIV simultaneously. When people become infected with TB and AIDS, it is almost always an irreversible formula,"" ministry officials said. Since newly-infected HIV patients risk contracting TB almost immediately, investigators are targeting a strategy for immunization with MV before patients need to start taking antiretroviral drugs. The scientific team at Dartmouth began Phase-I human studies with MV in the United States in 1994 and demonstrated that a multiple-dose series of MV was safe in both healthy subjects and patients with HIV infection. The group then conducted Phase-II studies in larger groups of adults in Zambia and in Finland. In the Zambian trial, researchers found that MV boosted immune responses against TB that had first been primed in childhood with the current TB vaccine, BCG. Subsequently, the DarDar group received NIH funding to conduct the large Phase-III efficacy trial among HIV-infected patients with prior BCG immunization in Tanzania. HIV patients are particularly vulnerable to TB because their immune systems are compromised. The vaccine works by boosting the immune responses of patients who have already been given the BCG vaccine earlier in life. "
6,2,2010,2 new HIV+ therapy centres by year-end,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-new-HIV-therapy-centres-by-year-end/articleshow/5521267.cms," PATNA: With two new anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres likely to become functional in the state by the year-end, HIV carriers can expect better availability of the therapy. The new ART centres are coming up at Rajendra Memorial Research Institute-Patna and Anugrah Narain Medical College and Hospital-Gaya. The state already has four ART centres at Patna Medical College and Hospital, Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital-Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital-Laheriasarai and Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital-Bhagalpur. ART centres provide facilities like counselling, pathological tests for assessing the CD4 count and free medicines, if required. Bihar has at present 13,539 HIV+ persons registered with the existing ART centres. Of them, 6,478 have been put on ART therapy. This therapy is started once the CD4 count falls below 200. ""Dedicated manpower has already been deputed for the two new ART centres which will become functional once the civil work is completed by December-end,"" Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) additional project director Sibi Alex told TOI. He said some of the patients registered with the existing ART centres would be shifted to the new ones. This would not only rationalise the distribution of workload to the ART centres but also reduce the distance the HIV+ patients have to cover to reach these centres. Plans are also afoot to start 19 link ART centres in addition to the existing five. ""This would further make things easier for the HIV+ cases,"" Alex said. The link ART centres free the HIV+ patients of the vicinity from the monthly chore of coming to the ART centres as they get counselling and medicines at the link ART centres. They, however, have to come to the ART centres for the CD count test every six months. The five link ART centres which have recently been made functional are at Nawada, Begusarai, Saran, Hajipur and Mokama. The process of linking HIV+ cases of these areas with the link centres is on. The new link ART centres are likely to become functional within the next three months in Bhojpur, Gopalganj, Arwal, Lakhisarai, Samastipur, East Champaran, West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Munger, Kishanganj, Katihar, Purnia, Araria, Khagaria, Nalanda, Siwan, Jehanabad and Aurangabad districts.

Baichung Bhutia has joined Nike's RED campaign which asks all and sundry to lace up and save lives. Some of the world's leading athletes have joined forces in the global fight against AIDS/HIV in South Africa. The famous names include Didier Drogba, Joe Cole, Andrei Arshavin, Marco Materazzi, Maria Sharapova and Kobe Bryant. And joining hands now is our very own Baichung Bhutia. ""It's a wonderful initiative from Nike. It's for a noble cause and I am pleased to be part of the campaign,"" Bhutia told TOI on Monday. The RED lace campaign hopes to raise money for the fight against AIDS/HIV through the sale proceeds of red laces. Bhutia, who happens to be the only Indian face in the campaign, promised his unflinching support towards the cause. The concept behind the RED campaign-Lace Up Save Lives- is that the red laces which are being sold by Nike would see the total proceeds of the profit equally distributed between The Global Fund to Fight Aids and Nike football-based community initiative to fight and prevent HIV/AIDS.

The incident took place in Koskharatala Mahadevpura village of Koraon tehsil, about 65 kms from here, when the 25-year-old youth took the extreme step on Tuesday night, police said. The youth's HIV status was detected last year when he went in for tests following prolonged illness. The results evoked disdain from villagers who banished him from all community gatherings for fear of ""spread of infection"", police said. This compelled the youth to move out of his house a few months ago and live in a tiny hut on the outskirts of the village. "

The police swung into action, but now they demand a price for finding her absconding husband. The local police has asked Poonam to hire a vehicle and give them money for petrol and ‘other expenses’ if she wants them to locate her husband. Poonam was only 16 years old when she got married to Rajesh, a salesman in a local firm. She came to know about her positive status during delivery of her daughter in May last year. The husband threw her out saying that he did not have enough money for the treatment. Rajesh also kept the baby. The hapless woman was also disowned by her father. She knocked at every possible door, but nothing happened. She then wrote to the chief minister last month. The CM’s office directed State AIDS Control Society to help Poonam get a job and asked police to take action against her husband and help her get custody of her daughter. "

They had married for love and were expecting their first child. Then a routine blood test brought their world crashing down. Batashi was inexplicably diagnosed HIV positive at Kolkata's School of Tropical Medicine (STM). A test on Tarak proved negative. What followed was worse than nightmare for Batashi. Her in-laws ostracized her and her husband accused her of straying. Tarak would have kicked her out had a little compassion for the woman he had once loved not lurked in one corner of his heart. Batashi had to attend several sessions of counselling while carrying her baby to term. Her son, born last May, was healthy. She had to travel to Kolkata regularly for more tests. Last week, following another round of tests at STM, she was told as suddenly as she was informed the first time that she did not have the virus. On Tuesday, after a repeat test, doctors at STM told her ""to go home and take rest"" because she wasn't HIV positive after all. ""When we went to collect the report last Wednesday, we were told that my wife did not have HIV. We couldn't believe it at first. Then I saw tears well up in my wife's eyes. I was so happy for her.

12,3,2010,HIV prevalence in city has dipped: AIDS body,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/HIV-prevalence-in-city-has-dipped-AIDS-body/articleshow/6121865.cms," MUMBAI: The HIV/AIDS infection has seen a drastic decline among the general population of Mumbai, and new infections too have come down significantly. However, Mumbai's dream to be counted as one of the cities with lesser prevalence of HIV still remains a distant one. The city's AIDS control body, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), has collated figures for the last four years and concluded that the prevalence of the virus has come down from 10.65% in 2007 to 7.69% in 2010 (till May) among the general population. For pregnant women too, the decline has been from 0.91% to 0.58% during the same period. Authorities attribute the decline to increased awareness among youth. ""It is the combined effect of awareness and our targeted interventions. Our biggest victory has been to prevent new infections,'' said project director of MDACS, Dr S S Kudalkar. The MDACS studied the data from 74 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres in the city. He added the percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women in the city used to be about 1.4 till four years ago, which has now come down to 0.5. ""Also, infection due to blood transfusions is down from 0.8% to about 0.4% in the same period,'' he said. The MDACS now hopes that the sentinel surveillance by the National AIDS Control Organisation, which begins in October, will give a thumbs up to Mumbai's war against HIV. MDACS has realised that taking Mumbai from category A to category B for HIV prevalence remains a daunting task. Category A is defined as any district where the number of pregnant women testing positive at ante-natal clinics in high risk areas is over 1% in the last three years. For Mumbai to be counted as category B, the number of pregnant women testing positive at these centres should be less than 1%. ""Also, the city should have lesser number of hotspots like brothels,'' said a civic official. ""It will be at least a decade for Mumbai to make it category B,'' said the official.

13,3,2010,"In rare op in India, HIV patient gets kidney transplant",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/In-rare-op-in-India-HIV-patient-gets-kidney-transplant/articleshow/5669455.cms," MUMBAI: Susheel Jha has had an unusual experience with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A resident of the central suburbs, he proudly announces unlike many HIV-positive patients, he has never been bedridden by frequent bouts of illnesses. He credits his health to his family and hisemployer, the Indian Railways, who have been supportive ever since he was diagnosed with HIV while randomly donating blood at a donation camp way back in 1997. The unusual patient scaled another height three months back; he became the first HIV-positive person in Maharashtra to undergo a kidney transplant. In the stigma-ridden world of HIV/AIDS, 45-year-old Jha's story holds out hope for the two-million-plus Indians living with HIV. In Jha's case, his 64-year-old mother Sitara donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son. ""I just want to see my child living healthily next to me,"" she said over the phone from Benares. The transplant is a milestone of sorts. Not surprisingly then, Jha's nephrologist Dr M Bahadur, transplant surgeon Shailesh Raina and medical consultant Dr Om Srivasatava are ecstatic with his progress since the transplant was carried out at Jaslok Hospital last November 26. ""This is the first time in Maharashtra that a HIV-positive person has got a transplant. It needs experienced specialists to manage the patient carefully so as to ensure that his body doesn't reject the donor organ while ensuring that the HIV infection doesn't flare up,"" Bahadur, who has been treating Jha since 2006, said. Admitting that it had indeed been a challenge to handle a HIV-positive patient, Srivastava said that the right medical environment (as in a super-speciality hospital like Jaslok), right protocol and medicines were needed for such transplants. ""If the HIV-positive patient's CD4 count is adequate and his viral load is negative, then he can safely undergo a transplant,"" added the Jaslok doctors. Worldwide, too, transplants for HIV-positive patients are a relatively new concept. In 2004, the US reported about a 100-odd liver and kidney transplants for HIV-positive patients. The man himself is calm. ""My HIV status was detected in 1997 and my kidney failure in 2006."" He was on dialysis for three years before doctors realised that transplant would be the only hope for him. ""In my 13 years with HIV, I took only 77 days of leave but I needed over three months of leave for the kidney transplant and the minor problems that cropped up after it,"" he said. Jha also believes that his employer, the Railways, played a great role in his ""healthy but HIV"" status. ""I have had access to antiretroviral drugs for the past 10 years. I was never discriminated against or passed up for promotion at my workplace. My dialysis would cost tens of thousands of rupees but the railways always paid up. They even paid for my transplant,"" added the father of two. Dr Harsh Jauhari, one of the seniormost nephrologists in the country, said that while a couple of HIV-positive patients had undergone transplants in India, little was chronicled about these special patients. ""There is a confidentially clause with HIV-positive patients that cannot be tampered with. So it is likely that we don't know about all the transplants that have taken place in this category. But there is no denying that these patients need specialised care,"" added the Delhi-based Jauhari. Another senior doctor said there were several issues about safety about the medical staff involved as well that had not allowed HIV-positive transplants so far. Incidentally, a study published in the Archives of Surgery last year by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that HIV-positive kidney transplant recipients could have the same one-year survival rates for themselves and their donor organs as those without HIV, if certain risk factors for transplant failure were recognized and tightly managed. According to the report, ""HIV patients were earlier not considered transplant candidates as researchers thought that the survival rates after transplantation were greatly compromised by the disease, which cripples the body's immune system.

The man, a migrant labourer hailing from Dera village under Rajnagar police station area, was detained by the police on Wednesday. He had set ablaze the house on Tuesday night. ""He might have hatched the plan to settle the score with in-laws because his wife had left him in dire straits at a time he needed care and warmth,"" an official said. His wife had deserted him and left for his parental house along with two children after he tested HIV positive. ""We are treating the case from a humanitarian angle because the culprit is an HIV/AIDS patient. Despite the alleged offence, we are yet to put him under arrest. Attempt is being made to unite the estranged couple,"" he said. As misconception and ill-conceived notion about the disease reigns supreme mostly in rural areas of the district, many are still scared of getting branded as AIDS patients. "
15,3,2010,HIV-positive woman denied timely abortion,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/HIV-positive-woman-denied-timely-abortion/articleshow/5695677.cms," CHENNAI: Ever since 28-year-old Seetha (name changed) discovered that she was HIV positive, she has been pleading with doctors for an abortion. Today, at 19 weeks of pregnancy, she is likely to lose the chance of legal medical termination. The law permits voluntary termination of pregnancies only up to 20 weeks. So far she has knocked on the doors of at least two Chennai Corporation maternity hospitals and two government hospitals, but all in vain. While the corporation hospitals said they could not do the termination as ""they are not allowed to terminate pregnancies for positive women"", doctors at Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) said they decided to wait until the 21st week of pregnancy for her haemoglobin levels to improve. ""According to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, if the pregnancy is above 20 weeks, doctors cannot abort the baby unless there is a case of lethal abnormality, and HIV/AIDS is not one such exception,"" says Dr Jayashree Gajaraj, consultant gynecologist, Apollo Specialty Hospitals. After the 28th week, the baby has to be delivered. Seetha was confirmed pregnant by Corporation's Maraimalai Adigalar Nagar health post on February 3. The following day she and her husband were tested HIV positive. ""We told them we don't want to carry on with the pregnancy. We have a healthy 5-year-old son,"" says Seetha's husband Shiva (name changed), a carpenter. On February 8, they were started on anti-retroviral therapy. She was then referred to KMC. A senior doctor said, ""In this case, the woman is HIV positive and anaemic. Her haemoglobin level was 8 g/dl against the normal 12 g/dl. We are told not to handle such high-risk and complicated cases."" Seetha was given five injections on alternate days from February 16 to 24 and admitted to KMC Hospital on March 1. ""They kept her in a ward isolated from others. I had no mattress. Nurses hesitated to care for me as I was positive,"" she said. She was transfused one unit of blood. ""Then they said the medicines required for abortion were not available. We bought them for Rs 700 from a nearby pharmacy,"" says Seetha, showing the bills. On March 8 and 9, two doses of misoprostol the drug that is used to induce labour and expel the foetus was administered. She was discharged on March 11 as she did not expel the foetus. She was asked to come back to the hospital on March 26. Gynecologists point out that discharging patients after administering misoprostol could lead to medical complications like infections including sepsis. A scan done on March 13 at Aynavaram corporation hospital shows she is 19 weeks pregnant. ""Doctors told me I can't get my baby aborted legally and that government hospitals will not do it after March 26,"" she said. KMC dean Dr V Kanakasabai said, ""Doctors probably thought it would complicate her medical condition. We did not think of the legal problem at that time."" "
16,3,2010,Relief for HIV+ heart patients,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/Relief-for-HIV-heart-patients/articleshow/5699548.cms," BANGALORE: Raising the hopes for lakhs of HIV-positive persons across the country, Bangalore-based Narayana Hrudayalaya has done a breakthrough by successfully conducting a heart surgery on a fully blown HIV-positive patient. Thirty-five-year-old Shankar (name changed) met with an accident four years ago. While getting treatment for his injured leg, he contracted the deadly HIV-virus during a blood transfusion. Over a period of time, the blood clot in the leg began to spread to the heart and lungs. The pressure on the lungs began on show on the right side of the heart, which began to fail. Barring his wife, everyone in his family deserted him. ""When he came to us two weeks ago, he was almost bedridden. We conducted the Pulmonary Endarterectomy. Since he was HIV positive, we had to take extra precautions while conducting the surgery. We use nearly 100 needles and even if one gets infected, it is dangerous. But we decided to take on the challenge and operated him,"" Dr Devi Shetty, chief cardiac surgeon at Narayana Hrudayalaya told The Times of India. Narayana Hrudayalaya does the second largest number of this surgery in the world. ""The idea was to tell the world that it is safe to operate HIV patients too. There is no doubt that it is risky and extra precautions must be ensured during the surgery,"" Shetty said. IT IS RE-BIRTH FOR ME Many hospitals refused to treat me because I was carrying the deadly virus. No one even cared if I died. It was not my fault that I became HIV-positive. I was almost bedridden. Dr Shetty is like God to me. He has given me new life. All I want to say is that there is nothing to fear in life. Being HIV-positive is a different issue but other health problems need to be treated as well. Just have courage to fight... (he breaks down). HOW WAS IT DONE During the six-hour open heart surgery, the body temperature is reduced to 18 degree (the normal temperature is 37 degree). The surgery is conducted in circulatory arrest, where the patient's body is frozen and entire blood collected to a reservoir. According to Dr Shetty the entire operation is conducted when the body is bloodless. Post-surgery the blood is pumped back into the body and the temperture is restored to 37 degrees. "
17,3,2010,"Sexual abuse, HIV haunt Kolkata streetchildren",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Sexual-abuse-HIV-haunt-Kolkata-streetchildren/articleshow/5703784.cms," KOLKATA: An HIV explosion might be waiting to happen in Kolkata. One per cent of the city's 15,000 street children (in the age group of 5-14) are HIV-positive, but were not aware of the fact that they were carrying the deadly virus, reveals a survey conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata. Most victims did not even know how the disease got transmitted or its symptoms and had contracted the lethal virus through sexual abuse, says the survey. While around 4% suffered from other sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, nearly 10% of these youngsters faced sexual abuse before turning 16. Titled Non-tobacco Substance Use, Sexual Abuse, HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Street Children in Kolkata', the study was carried out across 58 municipal wards of the city. More than 550 street children, who have no family, were interviewed and observed from 2007 to 2009. Random blood samples were collected to check the prevalence of diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and sexually transmitted diseases. The results have left the team of researchers shocked. ""One per cent of these children were HIV-positive which is a big number. Being marginalised and without any access to medical care, they will probably never come to know of their HIV status. Or, by the time they do, they will have infected others. This is an alarming situation since the urban homeless often act as a bridge between the infected population and those who are at risk. We need immediate intervention to check a potential epidemic,"" said Kamalesh Sarkar, deputy director, division of epidemiology, NICED. Sarkar led a five-member research team for the study. While no specific age of the HIV victims could be established from the random survey, all were below 16 years. Inquiring into the reasons behind the spread of the virus, the researchers found that most had faced sexual abuse. ""A minor percentage might have got the virus from sex workers. It is quite possible that they passed it on to others since both sexual abuse and promiscuity was common among street children. It is unlikely that any had got the virus from their parents,"" said Sarkar. The study reveals that while 26% of male street children faced sexual abuse before they turned 15, 13% of the girls who faced abuse were above 15 years. Around 13% of the boys who visited sex workers suffered from sexually transmitted diseases. ""Without any shelter or protection, these children will continue to be vulnerable. Moreover, they had no idea of HIV or that they could end up carrying the virus and infect others. Since there has never been any such study in the past, it is difficult to say if the number is rising. But unless steps are taken, it will definitely spiral and pose a serious health hazard which we are probably not ready to deal with,"" said Baishali Bal, one of the researchers. Less than half of the street children got two square meals a day, more than 85% slept in public places and earned less than Rs 1,000 a month. Substance abuse, the study disclosed, was extremely high among them. Thirty per cent used non-tobacco substances like adhesives, brown sugar, cocaine and alcohol. NICED has proposed shelters and support centres for street children at railway stations. ""It is at places like stations and markets that they generally tend to camp in search of work and food. We have written to the railway ministry to join hands with us for shelters at the stations,"" said Sarkar. "
18,3,2010,HIV among MSM on the rise,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/HIV-among-MSM-on-the-rise/articleshow/5709761.cms," CHENNAI: While there has been an overall decline in the prevalence of HIV infection in Tamil Nadu, the prevalence of infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) are on the rise. This is demonstrated not only by the latest figures of the National Aids Control Organisation which show the prevalence in Tamil Nadu dropping from 0.5% in 2003 to 0.25% in 2007 in the case of general population and rising from 4% to 7% in the case of MSM but also by the findings of a survey conducted by Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRGCARE). The survey, comprising a sample of 721 MSM from 18 different cities in the state, found 9% of MSM to be HIV-infected. ""The sustained campaign by the government about the use of condoms and its various awareness programmes for sex workers (the prevalence of HIV among them decreased from 9% in 2003 to 4.7% in 2007) and truck drivers have clearly shown results. But things remain unchanged as far as MSM and drug users are concerned,"" says Dr Sunil Suhas Solomon, senior medical officer and epidemiologist at YRGCARE, who presented the data at the 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Montreal last year. ""MSM remain a hidden population in India primarily due to Section 377 of the IPC, which has historically criminalised sex between men, and also the societal and family pressures to marry. Hence, there is very little community-level data of HIV among MSM. So we used a technique called peer-driven recruitment, which uses MSM to recruit other MSM to arrive at the study sample,"" says Dr Solomon. The study also documented the existence of HIV epidemics among MSM in many smaller cities such as Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin, which are usually not included in the planning of interventions targeted at MSM. Also, more interesting was the finding that the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among MSM who were married is double compared to MSM who were not married. ""About 35% of our sample of MSM were married. The higher prevalence of HIV infection among MSM who were married could partially be explained by their nature to keep their same sex practices even more hidden. Consequently, they ended up having more male partners, which has been shown by many studies to be a strong risk factor for HIV infection,"" explains Dr Solomon. Sahodaran, an organisation that works with MSM, conducted a similary survey recently in association with the Tuberculosis Research Centre in Chetpet and found that 8% of MSM in Chennai were HIV infected. But Sunil Menon, who runs Sahodaran, says there is no tangible evidence to back such figures because the gay community still remains hidden. ""Maybe the figure is shown rising just because more people are testing now than they did before. So there is no way of saying whether the prevalence is increasing, decreasing or remains the same,"" says Menon. Says Dr Solomon, ""The current phase of the National AIDS Control Programme has initiatives targeting MSM. Only time will tell the effectiveness of these programmes but the government needs to be applauded for the fact that it recognizes HIV among MSM as an issue and is taking steps to address it. However, it is equally important to address issues related to the families (wives and children) of these marginalised populations who are also being placed at risk via their spouses' behaviors."" "
19,3,2010,Hospital for HIV+ shuts down as funds dry up,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/Hospital-for-HIV-shuts-down-as-funds-dry-up/articleshow/5733059.cms," BAGALKOT: The state is in for a shock: the Bagalkot centre of the Freedom Foundation for HIV-affected persons will be closed down on Wednesday. The Foundation had set up four hospitals across South India two years ago, to curb the spread of HIV in the region. They were established at Bagalkot (Karnataka), Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Tiruchi (Kerala) and Kakinada (Tamil Nadu). The US-based Global Foundation For AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) had given financial support for the treatment of patients suffering from these three major diseases. A Chennai-based voluntary organization, Population of India, took help from the Foundation to set up these hospitals, which came as a boon to HIV-infected persons. The Bagalkot hospital, which started out in a rented house in Godi, on Muchakhandi Road, served patients from North Karnataka. The hospital had a 50-bed capacity. More than 4,157 HIV-affected people have been treated in this hospital till today, but fatalities have been a mere 400. The main reason for the hospital shutting down is that GFATM announced that it would discontinue funding. The agreement contract was not renewed from March 31, 2010. The closure procedure began on March 15, with patients being shifted to the government hospital. Equipment worth Rs 30 lakh was returned to the parent organization. It has also affected 32 staff working here, but it is patients who are worst hit. While the government is thinking of opening a separate section in the district hospital, it remains to be seen if these patients can be served round-the-clock and as efficiently. Several NGOs, social workers and industrialists approached the elected representatives to keep the hospital going, but till today, there has been no response from the authorities. Bagalkot district has a high number of HIV-positive patients, and with the closure of the hospital, the ball is now in the government's court. "
20,4,2010,Hope for shot? Structure of HIV protein unveiled,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Hope-for-shot-Structure-of-HIV-protein-unveiled/articleshow/5758543.cms," NEW YORK: In a breakthrough which may pave the way for a vaccine against AIDS, scientists have provided what they claim is the first-ever glimpse of the structure of a key protein, gp120, found on surface of a subgroup of HIV-1. In addition, the scientists from California Institute of Technology demonstrated that a particular antibody to gp120 makes contact not only with the protein, but with CD4 receptor that gp120 uses to gain entrance into the body's T cells. This three-dimensional understanding of how gp120 is built is more than just a basic scientific advance, they say. ""There's a tremendous continuing effort to develop a vaccine for HIV and most of those efforts use gp120. Having more structural information will facilitate better vaccine design,"" said lead scientist Ron Diskin. The team looked specifically at gp120 from what is known as clade C HIV-1. To explain what that means, here's a brief HIV family history: Most people who get HIV and proceed to AIDS are infected with a member of the HIV-1 family of viruses. HIV-1 is divided into groups; most AIDS-related strains of the virus come from group M. The groups are further subdivided into what are known as clades. Clade B is the form of group M HIV-1 most often found in the United States and western Europe, and the one that is probably best-studied to date. Clade C, the clade studied by the Caltech team, is ""the one that is devastating Africa and Asia,"" said Diskin. ""It's the one that probably causes the largest number of infections worldwide."" In order to uncover the structure of clade C gp120--and determine if the hypothesis about its similarities was indeed true — the Caltech team needed to crystallize the protein. That was no easy task. Turns out, says Diskin, the protein itself is not stiff enough for crystallization. And so the researchers created a complex of molecules consisting of a gp120 monomer, a CD4 receptor, and an anti-HIV antibody known as 21c. "

According to information, two community care centres for HIV patients are already functioning in Patiala and Amritsar, respectively. Talking to TOI on Saturday, an official of the health department said, “The project will be in joint collaboration with Red Cross as it has received grants of Rs 21.5 lakh for the project. The centre will include 10 beds for HIV patients.” He said the centre would motivate chronic patients whose families fail to support them in terms of treatment, besides giving them adequate diet. The official said work had already kicked off and the community care centre would open in the Red Cross building near Civil Hospital. He said a doctor, counsellor, three nurses, four outreach health workers, one part-time lab technician, along with a project coordinator and dietician had been appointed for the job. Notably, NACO is working on the oral substitution therapy for intravenous drug users so as to control incidence of HIV and for this, work on opening the drug addiction centre is going on. Dr Geetika Kansal, district aids programme officer said the move had been taken under NACO phase III and was aimed at chronic patients, who could not afford treatment. "

Hypodermic syringes are hidden below the surface pointing upwards to prick bomb squad experts as they hunt for devices, British newspaper the Sun reveals. The heroin needles are feared to be contaminated with hepatitis and HIV. And if the bomb goes off, the needles become deadly flying shrapnel. The tactic has been used in the Afghan badlands of Helmand, and was exposed by Tory MP and ex-Army officer Patrick Mercer. Conservative MP Patrick Mercer, a former army officer, exposed the tactic. “Are there no depths to which these people will stoop?” the Sun quoted him as saying. “This is the definition of a dirty war.” Not only syringes but razor blades are also being buried as the Taliban use increasingly “despicable” tactics. Protective Kevlar gloves have been issued to all Royal Engineer and Royal Logistic Corps bomb search teams. Lieutenant Colonel David Southall, Commanding Officer of the Counter-IED Task Force said: “Improvised explosive devices remain a tactic of desperation and last resort. “The Taliban know they can’t take us on and win in a conventional toe-to-toe fight – whilst they resort to some pretty despicable IED emplacement tactics,” he added.

The hospital, however, refuted the allegations and said she had been treated there twice earlier. Goregaon resident Ayesha (name changed) was admitted to the medical ward of G T Hospital around 11 am on Tuesday. However, she was discharged within half-an-hour and asked to go to surgical department. Ayesha alleged that first, she got admitted to the hospital only after waiting in the rain for 5 hours and intervention by senior doctors. Secondly, she claimed that, instead of discharging her, the doctors could have simply transferred her papers from one department to another (surgery). What upset her the most was that a resident medical officer allegedly told her that her HIV-positive status could pose a problem for both patients and doctors. She also claimed that she was forcefully handed over the Discharge Against Medical Advice (DAMA) papers. ""There is an abscess in my neck that has to be operated upon but doctors want me to go to some other hospital. They are worried that the HIV may pass on to others,"" Ayesha said. Later in the evening, social workers shifted her to St George Hospital. It's been two years now that she has been living with HIV, while her husband succumbed to the same ailment seven months ago. The hospital, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion by social workers. ""The patient had sought discharge against doctors' advice,"" said Dr A P Chaudhari, medical superintendent of G T Hospital. ""She was admitted to the wrong ward and I had asked my doctors to take her to the casualty and admit her again. We have many HIV+ patients and there is no reason to send her away."" "

""Our study found that both methods are effective in preventing HIV transmission. The antiretroviral regimen for treating the mothers is much more expensive and requires access to medical facilities that aren't widely available in developing countries such as Malawi, The baby regimen, in comparison, is incredibly cheap and much easier to implement. These findings are important because each year about 200,000 infants worldwide become infected with HIV through breastfeeding, and in the developing world infant formula is both prohibitively expensive and associated with increased infant deaths,"" the study's author Charles van der Horst said. In the study, 2,369 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs in Malawi, were randomly assigned to one of three groups -- a maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) group, a second group in which infants were treated with nevirapine liquid and control group for whom medications were given at the time of delivery only. None of these women had developed AIDS yet and thus did not need treatment for their own health. After their babies were born, women in the maternal antiretroviral group received a single tablet twice a day containing the drugs zidovudine and lamivudine. They also received a dose of nevirapine by mouth once a day for 14 days and then twice daily from 2 to 28 weeks. Follow us on Twitter for more stories"

26,7,2010,Cells that fight HIV created,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/Cells-that-fight-HIV-created/articleshow/6128783.cms," PARIS: Lab work on mice has opened up a novel way of closing a gateway to the AIDS virus, according to a study published on Friday. The doorway in question is called CCR5, a protein that helps the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) penetrate a cell, its first step before hijacking the cellular machinery and reproducing itself. Around a decade ago, scientists discovered that people who had a tiny gap in the genetic code for making CCR5 were surprisingly resistant to HIV infection and took more time to progress to AIDS. This gene variant, known as CCR5 delta 32, results in smaller CCR5 proteins, which prevents most strains of HIV from infecting the cell. Testing a theory, scientists in the US took immature haematopoietic cells—which make immune and red blood cells—from mice. They modified some of the cells, using a brand-new enzyme “cutter” to delete the famous CCR delta 32 section. As a result, when these cells matured and divided, they lacked the key code for making normal CCR5. The modified cells were reinjected back into the rodents, which were then exposed to HIV. Twelve weeks after infection, the animals had recovered their stock of immune T-cells and their levels of HIV were very low. But “control” mice that had not received the modified cells were highly infected and their immune systems weak. If the approach is found to be safe and effective on humans, it opens the way to creating a long-term generation of HIV-resistant T-cells in the body—in other words, a patient could suppress HIV without taking powerful antiretroviral drugs. The experiment headed by Paula Cannon of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, and reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is the third avenue that has opened up for CCR5 investigators. Drugs that inhibit CCR5 are already being licensed as “salvage” therapy for patients whose immune systems have been crippled by HIV. Doctors are also testing in trials on volunteers a CCR delta 32 technique, but using T-cells as opposed to stem cells. “It’s a one-shot treatment if it works,” noted study co-author Paula Cannon, associate professor of molecular microbiology at the University of Southern California. In gene therapy, doctors try to coax the human body into doing something differently by tweaking its genetic structure. To treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, scientists have been experimenting with using gene therapy to boost the immune system. "

Her condition worsened after she didn't get regular ART treatment despite repeated pleas, says the Sex Workers' Union. Following this, the Karnataka Sex Workers' Union, with the support of human rights organizations, women's groups, HIV-positive networks and sex workers' units staged a protest in front of Beggars Colony. 'After getting calls to the crisis helpline, I visited the place. One can hardly call it a rehabilitation centre. I have got six sex workers released so far. But they were nabbed again and put in the Colony; one of them was HIV-positive. However, the colony doctor not only refused to treat her but also did not allow her to go to a hospital saying her being positive for HIV wasn't proved before him,"" charged Tejaswini, convener of Karnataka Sex Workers' Union. The doctor said he'd send her for testing on Monday and then decide if she needed to go to a hospital. But her health was deteriorating and she needed urgent medical attention, said Tejaswini.

These women are homeless but they are not beggars. It is the duty of the government to provide them housing."" ONE DOC FOR 1,700 INMATES 'We had no proof to say she was HIV-positive and we couldn't conduct any test as the centre is not equipped with necessary equipment. We asked the protesting NGOs to take her out by giving an application in a letterhead or with permission from the tahsildar. But they did not do so. After the protest, they gave an application seeking her release. According to our doctor, her condition was not worse,"" said C N Manjegowda, president, Central Beggars' Committee, that runs the Beggars' Rehabilitation Centre. 'From now on, we will check HIV status when we take beggars. If found positive, we will refer them for further treatment immediately,"" he said. 'Also, we have only one doctor to treat all 1,700 inmates and have no power to recruit doctors. The government has entrusted the healthcare of inmates to Karuna Trust, an NGO.

They are among the 130 thalassaemic children registered with Jodhpur's Marwar Thalassaemic Society, said a source. In the last one-and-a-half years, at least eight thalassaemic children in the city were found to be HIV positive while 46 others were infected by hepatitis B virus prompting a probe by the state government. In December 2008, five children tested positive for HIV and 29 for hepatitis C virus. In May 2010, three more children were found HIV positive and 17 suffered from hepatitis C. According to the Thalassaemic Society, if all the children who received blood transfusion are tested, the numbers may go up. Unless new techniques for testing are introduced, the hazard will remain, felt society members. Recently, members met the principal of S N Medical College and the divisional commissioner and demanded nucleic acid test at Umaid Hospital blood bank to prevent infection during transfusion. Medical college principal R K Aseri said a proposal for nucleic acid test which is a more advanced blood test has been sent to Rajasthan government which is now studying the expenses involved. The college has also formed a three-member committee to probe if there are any flaws in the blood bank's testing methods. The Society also demanded special consideration for families below poverty line and adequate staff and resources at Umaid Hospital's thalassaemia ward. Society secretary Vipin Gupta said, ""We want the blood banks to have better technology.'' However, Raj Shree Behra, in-charge of Umaid Hospital's blood bank, said there is no way to reduce to zero the window period, that is the time taken for seroconversion after exposure to the HIV virus. Seroconversion is the development of detectable antibodies in blood to fight an infectious agent. It normally takes some time for antibodies to develop after the initial exposure to an infection. If infected blood has been taken from any donor before the formation of detectable antibodies, there is no technology which can detect them in the stored blood at any point of time, said Behra. Antibodies will develop only when the infected blood is given to any other person. Currently, ELISA test has a longer window period disabling it to detect any antibody at early stage in the donated blood. It is certified by National AIDS Control Organisation. "
29,7,2010,"56 kids get HIV, hepatitis after blood transfusion",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/56-kids-get-HIV-hepatitis-after-blood-transfusion/articleshow/6161119.cms," JODHPUR: At least 56 children suffering from thalassaemia tested positive for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C after receiving blood transfusion at government-run Umaid hospital in Jodhpur. They are among the 130 thalassaemic children registered with Jodhpur’s Marwar Thalassaemic Society, said a source. Terming it as a case of negligence, Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the state government was responsible in the case. “It is a case of negligence. It is the responsibility of the state government to take proper precautions,” Azad said in Srinagar. In the last one-and-a-half years, at least eight thalassaemic children in the city were found to be HIV positive while 46 others were infected by hepatitis B virus prompting a probe by the state government. In December 2008, five children tested positive for HIV and 29 for hepatitis C virus. In May 2010, three more children were found HIV positive and 17 suffered from hepatitis C. According to the Thalassaemic Society, if all the children who received blood transfusion are tested, the numbers may go up. Recently, members met the principal of S N Medical College and the divisional commissioner and demanded nucleic acid test at Umaid Hospital blood bank to prevent infection during transfusion. Medical college principal R K Aseri said a proposal for nucleic acid test — which is a more advanced blood test — has been sent to Rajasthan government which is now studying the expenses involved. The college has also formed a three-member committee to probe if there are any flaws in the blood bank's testing methods. The Society also demanded special consideration for families below poverty line and adequate staff and resources at Umaid Hospital's thalassaemia ward.Society secretary Vipin Gupta said, “We want the blood banks to have better technology.'' Currently, ELISA test has a longer window period, disabling it to detect any antibody at early stage in the donated blood. Window period is the time taken for seroconversion ater exposure to the HIV virus. tnn &amp; agencies "
30,7,2010,4 HIV +ve patients face eviction from their home,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-HIV-ve-patients-face-eviction-from-their-home/articleshow/6161180.cms," HYDERABAD: Four HIV positive residents of a colony in Saroor Nagar are just one week away from being thrown out of their home. Reason: the residents welfare association has taken objection to their medical condition and ordered them to leave, with the alleged aid of local police. The apartment located in HUDA complex, Saroor Nagar is owned by a social worker, B S H Prasad and acts as a shelter for HIV positive people who are trying to lead a normal life. The home currently houses three students enrolled in leading professional colleges in the city and a lecturer of a private junior college in Guntur. According to the owner of the apartment, trouble started when the president of the residents welfare association, Srilatha, chanced upon posters on HIV awareness inside the apartment, where the four lived, around two weeks ago. She spread the word among the neighbours and in the enquiries which ensued, two of the four residents of the flat revealed their medical condition. Following this, the resident welfare association threatened the students and asked them to vacate. When they did not oblige, 16 of the 32 house owners of the residential complex gathered signatures complaining against their stay and approached the Saroor Nagar police station for help in evicting them. ""The police did not lodge any case but an SI, Naresh asked the four residents to leave the place. When they objected, he threatened them of dire consequences,"" said Prasad, activist and house owner, who has now moved the State Human Rights Commission against the residents welfare association. Responding to the issue, human rights and anti-stigma activists said that the residents welfare association of the complex and the police who allegedly threatened the HIV patients can be booked under the HIV AIDS Bill 2007. ""The right to privacy and right to lead a public and cultural life of all the four patients were denied in this case. Those responsible for publicising their medical condition and threatening them to vacate the place on the basis of their medical condition can be taken to court. It is a shame that such a thing happened in the city,"" said G Jagdeesh Kumar, former sate manager of Telugu Network of People Living with HIV AIDS (AP) and activist. Meanwhile, Cyberabad police officials denied that any of their personnel threatened the inmates of the house. Police, however, admitted that a complaint had reached the Saroor Nagar police station from the residents association a fortnight ago. ""No action was taken. We advised them to solve the issue among themselves,"" a police official said. Activists, however, pointed out that the police could have taken action against the association. ""Instead of trying to solve the issue the police should have booked the residents welfare association as they were open about their bias,"" said M A Shakeel, coordinator, Human Rights Law Network. "

33,7,2010,11 HIV cases detected among TB patients,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/11-HIV-cases-detected-among-TB-patients/articleshow/6184221.cms," LUDHIANA: It seems that the health department's purpose of keeping track of TB patients, facing a HIV risk, has been solved. As the department has started the concept of offering voluntary HIV testing and compulsory counselling to patients, 11 new HIV cases have been identified in the second quarter. Sources said in the second quarter, after a total of 800 TB patients, who never had undergone for HIV testing were checked, and 11 were found HIV positive. The integrated package had been started on April 1 where all the TB patients coming for the sputum tests were given the voluntary counselling on HIV and were motivated to go for the testing at the integrated counselling and testing centres. Till now, the district health department did not have the data regarding the number of TB patients suffering from HIV. While giving the information, one of the officials of the health department said that under this program counselling would be given at the integrated centre, and, if the TB patient agrees to go for the test and turns positive for HIV, then he/she will be given antiretroviral drugs free. At present, more than 500 TB patients are coming only in civil hospital for the sputum tests. On the condition of anonymity, one of the staff members of the ICTC Centre said that mostly people who were suffering from TB were at higher risk of getting the infection but due to the lack of awareness they did not come for the voluntary tests and patients themselves were not aware that they were suffering from HIV. While giving the information, district TB officer Ashish Chawla said that this had been started with the aim to create awareness among the TB patients and to check the incidence among the TB patients as with this it was clear that almost 1% of the patients suffering from TB were suffering from HIV. Dr Chawla added that along with the status of HIV patients, it would be helpful to provide them treatment after checking the patients and would be helpful in deciding the follow-up treatment. "
34,7,2010,New blood test helps identify HIV status of newborns,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/New-blood-test-helps-identify-HIV-status-of-newborns/articleshow/6184468.cms," NEW DELHI: A simple blood test is now helping India identify the status of children born to HIV positive mothers as early as six weeks after their birth, instead of 18 months. Till recently, paediatricians in India, on detection of anti-HIV antibodies in children below 18 months, could never tell for sure whether they were already infected or the antibodies were transferred to them from their mother. Therefore, doctors couldn't even start the life-saving Anti-Retroviral Treatment -- the only effective way to treat HIV -- on them. This, according to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), led to 33,000 new infants getting the infection every year from their HIV positive mothers. India, in March, rolled out the highly accurate DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test in the four high prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Available in 767 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and 180 ART centres, the DNA PCR can test the blood sample of a child after it reaches six weeks of age and accurately say whether it is already infected with HIV or not. The antibody test available before March could only confirm the HIV status after the child reached 18 months of age. In the last three months, 45 children have been tested for HIV status. NACO hopes to roll out the test to 10,000 children born to HIV positive mothers by March next year. ""As soon as the child of an HIV positive mother is older than six weeks, his or her blood sample is collected and transported to seven national labs for testing with DNA PCR which gives us a definitive diagnosis on the child's HIV status. The report is available in just a week,"" NACO's ART chief Dr B B Rewari told TOI before leaving for the International AIDS Conference in Vienna. Dr Rewari, who will present this data in Vienna, added, ""Usually, if such children aren't put on treatment, 50% of them die within the first year of birth if infected. So early diagnosis and treatment is vital."" Till now, India has detected 19,000 children with HIV. Unlike other tests, the HIV DNA PCR test does not rely on the presence of antigens or antibodies in the blood for diagnosis. Instead, it identifies genetic material by highlighting sequences of the virus within the subject's DNA. Experts say all babies born to mothers with HIV are born with HIV antibodies. Babies who are not infected lose their antibodies by the time they are about 18 months old. However, most babies can be diagnosed as either infected or uninfected by the time they are three months old by using DNA PCR test. ""The PCR test is more sensitive than the HIV test, and is not used in the standard HIV testing of adults. It looks for the presence of HIV itself, not antibodies,"" a NACO official said. When a woman is tested HIV positive, she is offered special medical care to reduce the risk of her baby being infected. Some pregnant women with HIV decide to have their baby. Others choose to have a termination. ""There are now very effective drugs that can reduce the risk of an HIV positive mother passing the virus to her baby in the womb or at birth. Delivery by elective Caesarean section also reduces the risk of a baby becoming infected. Beast-feeding in such cases increases the risk of the baby becoming infected,"" the official said. * An estimated 22.7 lakh Indians are infected with HIV * India has an HIV prevalence of 0.29% * It usually takes 10 years for HIV to become full blown AIDS * The first AIDS case in India was reported from Chennai, in 1986 * Globally, more than 33 million people have AIDS or HIV, half of them women * Since the beginning of the epidemic in 1981, 60 million people have got infected with HIV and at least 25 million have died of AIDS "
35,7,2010,48% spurt in number of HIV patients receiving life-saving ART,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/48-spurt-in-number-of-HIV-patients-receiving-life-saving-ART/articleshow/6188292.cms," NEW DELHI: An additional 1.2 million HIV patients across the globe were started on the life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in 2009 -- the highest number of infected availing of this medicare in a single year. According to latest WHO figures, an estimated 5.2 million HIV patients were receiving this life-saving treatment at the end of 2009. India is among the top 20 countries, which recorded the highest percentage increase in the number of people receiving ART between 2007 and 2008. Over this one year, there was a spurt in 48% of patients -- from 1.50 lakh to 2.34 lakh -- who could receive ART. The number of facilities with HIV testing and counselling in the country has also increased from 4,269 in 2007 to 4,817 in 2008. Since 2003, the number of people receiving HIV treatment has increased 12-fold globally. The cost needed for HIV treatment this year is pegged around $ 9 billion, according to UNAIDS. However, the future for the global fight against AIDS does not seem too bright, financially. A new report, released at the International Aids Conference in Vienna on Monday, says that donor nation support for AIDS relief was flat in 2009, thanks to the global meltdown, with only $7.6 billion provided during the year, ending the run of annual double-digit percentage point increases in donor support for international AIDS assistance since 2002 when donor governments provided a total of $1.2 billion. America remained the largest donor nation in the world, accounting for more than half (58%) of last year's disbursements, followed by the United Kingdom (10.2%), Germany (5.2%), the Netherlands (5%) and France (4.4%). ""Reductions in investment on AIDS programs are hurting the AIDS response. At a time, when we are seeing results in HIV prevention and treatment, we must scale up, not scale down,"" said Michel Sidibi, UNAIDS executive director. UNAIDS estimates that $23.6 billion was needed to address the epidemic in low-and middle-income countries in 2009. That suggests a growing gap of $7.7 billion between available resources and the need. Though the financial deficit comes as a cause for concern, Dr Hiroki Nakatani -- WHO's assistant director-general for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases -- has praised global efforts to put more and more patients on life-saving HIV drugs. ""The 1.2 million is the largest increase in people accessing treatment in a single year. It is an extremely encouraging development,"" he said. At the International AIDS Conference, WHO is calling for timely treatment for HIV patients. The basic objective is to begin treatment before they take ill because of weakened immunity. ""Starting treatment earlier gives us an opportunity to enable people living with HIV to stay healthier and live longer,"" says Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, WHO, director, HIV/AIDS. Estimates developed through epidemiological modeling suggest that HIV-related mortality can be reduced by 20% between 2010 and 2015 if these guidelines for early treatment are implemented. Earlier treatment can prevent opportunistic infections including tuberculosis -- the number one killer blow for HIV patients. Deaths from TB can be reduced by as much as 90%, if both HIV and TB patients are treated earlier. ""In addition to saving lives, earlier treatment has also prevention benefits,"" Dr Hirnschall says. ""Because treatment reduces the level of virus in the body, it means HIV-positive people are less likely to pass the virus on to their partners."" WHO's treatment guidelines expand the number of people recommended for HIV treatment from an estimated 10 million to 15 million. Bernhard Schwartlander, director, evidence, strategy and results, UNAIDS, said, ""People with weaker immune systems who come late for treatment require more complex and costly drugs and services than those who start treatment earlier and are healthier."" Asia's fight against AIDS* Number of HIV patients in 2008 was 4.7 million against 4.5 million in 2001 * Number of new HIV infections in 2008 was 3.5 lakh against 4 lakh in 2001 * Number of newly-infected children in 2008 was 21,000 against 33,000 in 2001 * Number of AIDS-related deaths in 2008 was 3.3 lakh against 2.8 lakh in 2001 * Asia is home to 60% of the world's population. But, it is second only to sub-Saharan Africa as far as HIV patients is concerned * India accounts for almost half of Asia's HIV prevalence * Only 37% of HIV patients in Asia, who require ART were getting it in 2008, which is below the global average of 42% "
36,7,2010,Vaginal gel offers protection against HIV infection,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Vaginal-gel-offers-protection-against-HIV-infection/articleshow/6192816.cms," NEW DELHI: A vaginal gel can now protect women against HIV infection -- an innovation that scientists believe could be most crucial for reproductive health since the Pill. On Tuesday, scientists announced at the International Aids Conference in Vienna that they have successfully tested a gel, containing antiretroviral drug Tenofovir, which is usually taken as a tablet by HIV patients. The drug can reduce a woman's chances of contracting HIV from an infected partner by 50% if used 12 hours before and after having sex. Interestingly, the gel had undergone a safety and acceptability trial on 100 women at National Aids Research Institute (NARI) in Pune in 2007. It can also reduce the risk of genital herpes by 51%. Being hailed as a major breakthrough globally, the CAPRISA trial followed 900 HIV-negative, sexually active South African women in the age group between 18 and 40. Two-and-a-half-years on, researchers found the gel reduced chances of HIV infection by 50% after a year and 39% after 30 months. The study revealed that those women -- who used the drug consistently nearly 80% of the time before having sex -- would be 54% less prone to infection. Health secretary K Sujatha Rao told TOI ""This is a major breakthrough, and will especially benefit India's 300,000-strong sex worker community involved in multi-partner sex. It will also help women who usually do not have the power to insist on condom use and fidelity, or to abandon partnerships that put them at high risk."" K Chandramouli, director general of National Aids Control Organisation. added, ""At present, India has 2.7 million HIV patients. We also record 1.7 lakh fresh cases of HIV every year, nearly 40% of which are women. Such a microbicide, once ready for implementation in our programme, will greatly benefit women."" According to NARI director Dr R S Paranjape, the gel underwent safety and acceptability study in India as well. ""The preparatory work for the CAPRISA trial was conducted here along with the Microbicide Trials Network. The overall safety profile of the gel was good and it was well accepted by women. Presently, it provides 40% protection. The scientific community will now look at increasing this percentage,"" he explained. With a vaccine against HIV remaining elusive, scientists have for the past 20 years been looking for such an effective microbicide -- products such as gels, films, rings or creams that women could apply on their vagina to prevent HIV transmission. Finally, the breakthrough has happened, thanks to the microbicide that contains 1% Tenofovir. Tenofovir gel is an advanced second-generation HIV-specific microbicide that neither tries to kill the AIDS virus nor block it from entering the body as its predecessors. Instead, it is designed to prevent the virus from replicating when it comes in contact with an uninfected T-cell. Naturally, the virus will fail to survive for long to cause systemic infection. Women, who constitute 50% all new HIV cases globally, are also twice as likely as their male partners to contract HIV during unsafe sex. ""Tenofovir gel could fill an important HIV prevention gap by empowering women who are unable to successfully negotiate mutual faithfulness or condom use with their male partners,"" said study co- principal investigator Dr Quarraisha Abdool Karim. ""Eleven trials in the past 15 years have shown no change or even sometimes an increase in transmission rates. Tenofovir gel has a potential dual effect in preventing HIV. Since women with genital herpes are much more likely to become infected with HIV, the additional protection of tenofovir gel against herpes creates a second mechanism whereby the gel may have a bigger impact in preventing HIV,"" he explained. The gel is undergoing another Microbicide Trials Networks VOICE -- Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic -- study that will provide evidence about the safety and efficacy of tenofovir gel used daily, irrespective of when participants have sex. Once this study is conducted, drug regulatory authorities will determine if the gel is safe and effective for HIV prevention. It may take another two years before public can use it. Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, said, ""For the first time, we have seen results for a woman-initiated and controlled HIV prevention option."" "

38,7,2010,HIV stigma gets a comic relief,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/HIV-stigma-gets-a-comic-relief/articleshow/6239040.cms," LUVKNOW: Even before the virus could affect their health, the HIV stigma has eclipsed their lives. Innocent children born to positive parents facing discrimination and insecurity fail to reason their agony. Over 40 such children have broken their silence. Using comics strip they have shared their feelings and urged for a humane treatment. Some of these comics strips would be displayed with the Red Ribbon Express (RRE) in August. The comics were prepared by them at a workshop organised by World Comics India. Supported by Unicef, the workshop was held at the Nehru Yuva Kendra and concluded on Wednesday. Suresh and Sita are only examples to show how children born to positive people are ostracised. At first glance, they appear like any ordinary siblings. But a little probe makes one realise that the world has really fallen apart for these HIV positive children. ""At an age when what they need the most is decent living, these kids are fighting the deadly disease,'' said Ramesh Srivastava, a volunteer working for kids like the duo. Their parents were thrown out of their native village in east UP. Construction site owned by their Chandigarh-based maternal uncle became their home after the death of their parents. Kids were made to work like labourers in lieu of two meals a day. But when their aunt came to know about them being HIV positive, she drove them out. The kids, in an attempt to return to their roots, reached Lucknow and were seen by policemen near Itaunja. The cops sent them to an orphanage and informed protection home authorities who sent them to Shanti Niketan of Lucknow, one of the few places in the country which takes care of AIDS orphans. Now 12, Suresh has been able to reason the treatment he got till he reached this home. However, he is not ready to feel `pitiable' on account of this virus he inherited from his parents. ""It's not my fault,'' he affirms and tells the same to his sister. His comic-strip also says the same. ""This is the basic message that needs to be disseminated across the society to ensure a future for kids like Sita and Suresh. People sensitive to their plight can help in re-integrating them with the society by improving their living conditions and ensuring economic and social autonomy,'' said Augustine Veliath of Unicef. Besides producing a tool to sensitise people and create awareness, the kids had a great time. ""We began with learning to make faces using alphabets O and T. While O becomes the outline of the face, eyebrows, nose and mouth are sketched out of the T,'' said Mohit, who actively participated in the workshop. Sharad Sharma, founder World Comics India who taught the kids how to draw, added that with a little practice, children switch over from simple faces to the ones carrying expressions. ""The trainees were then taught to conceptualise a story based on an issue with a message, imagine characters, think of a catchy beginning and an end with an impact,'' he said. "

NGO Spandana, having a good database of ""HIV positives"" of the district, helps the families of wannabe brides/ grooms to visit each other's houses. But for being HIV+, the NGO does not consider other criteria like caste, religion, area, financial status, etc. Sharing their success with the 'Sunday Times of India', Mahesh Jadhav, Spandana advisory committee member, said: ""All the couples married through our bureau are leading a happy life. Sadly, a woman was widowed after her husband died."" The marriages will be registered in the headship of the bureau. The couples will also be made to sign on a stamp paper, pledging their loyalty to one another. The groom should compulsorily make a fixed deposit of Rs 10,000 in his wife's name in the bank. The bureau charges Rs 2,000 from the newlyweds as a donation. "
40,8,2010,"HIV widow, children forced to flee home",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-widow-children-forced-to-flee-home/articleshow/6249836.cms," MUMBAI: Exactly a year after parents in Hasegaon of Latur district withdrew their children from a school which had eight HIV-positive orphans, the state’s hinterland has thrown up another tale of stigmatisation. Social activists say that the villagers of Longhe near Kolhapur reportedly subjected a HIV-positive widow and her children to such discrimination that the three were forced to flee to Mumbai. The widow, 30-year-old Sangita Kamble, was asked to keep away from her work as an anganwadi worker even as her six-year-old daughter, also HIV-positive, was denied admission in Longhe village’s only school. But worse was the fact that Sangita’s 12-year-old son, who is perfectly healthy, was tormented as well. ""The other children in the school keep taunting him and threaten to ‘send him to his father’,"" said Sangita, who reached Mumbai a fortnight ago in the hope that it might treat her better. Sangita’s ""journey to hell"" began over 15 months ago when her husband, Chandrakant, was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, and the rest of the family too was asked to undergo tests. After Chandrakant died in June 2009, her in-laws told several family friends about her positive status. ""The village immediately took up a stance against me,"" she said. People would not sit next to her in public transport vehicles or would shout at her daughter for trying to mingle with their children, she said, struggling to keep her tears in check. In Longhe, a hamlet of over 900 people, villagers first started with not allowing their children to attend the anganwadi. ""Parents told officials of the Integrated Child Development Services to sack her but the government officials refused to,"" said Sanyogita Dhamdhere of Centre for Advocacy and Research. ""I was told that I could take a salary from ICDS but not attend work. This hurt me a great deal. Why should I not be allowed the dignity to work?"" Sangita told reporters on Monday. "
41,8,2010,"HIV: Housewives, professionals at high risk now",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/HIV-Housewives-professionals-at-high-risk-now/articleshow/6263505.cms," CHENNAI: After years of providing treatment, care and support for HIV/AIDS among high risk groups like truckers, commercial sex workers, injectable drug users and transgenders, the government is suddenly faced with a new challenge -- the increasing incidence of HIV among youth, possibly due to unsafe casual sex. Concerned by the trend, the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TNSACS) is organising a youth carnival to create awareness and promote safe sex. The state has been boasting about a decline of infection in the population, but those working in the HIV/AIDS sector fear that there is an increase in the incidence of the disease. A recent analysis undertaken by TNSACS has shown that the profiles of the newly infected people were not from the high risk groups. ""Instead they were housewives, single working people and students. We also did a study on usage of condoms among youth. That's when we found that many have occasional unprotected intercourse with multiple partners,"" said Dr. S.Thennarasu, the regional coordinator. Other senior officals in TNSAC confirmed the trend. ""The infection rate is high only within the age-group of 15-29 years. Today, casual sex has a fair amount of social acceptance. Mobility amidst both sexes is on the rise,"" the official added. Others working in the sector agree. ""There is a clear decline in the HIV prevalence rates among sex workers and truckers. In a small study we found that casual sex among working professionals particularly those in garment industry and the BPO sector was high."" said Dr R Lakshmibai, the project director of TAI. As per data furnished by the TNSAC, the prevalence of HIV among commercial sex workers had decreased from 8.8% in 2003 to 3.6% in 2007. Consequently, even prevalence of other Sexually Transmitted Diseases(STD) had decreased from 16.8% in 2000 to 8% in 2007. However, the state registered a total of 28,000 cases in 2008-09 and 30,000 new cases in 2009-10. ""There were only basic awareness programs conducted for the general population. Otherwise, we focused only on target groups. It's probably time to change that,"" said an official. TNSACS, in association with APAC and TAI will organise a youth carnival in August that will attempt to sensitise them to the dangers of unsafe sex with strangers. ""Intercourses with multiple partners is always risky,"" explained Dr Bimal Charles, project director of Aids Prevention and Control Project (APAC). ""And the youth are always prone to experimentation. If they are not aware of safety, it increases the risk.""

At a programme on UN Millennium Development Goals organized by the department of communication, consultant obstetrician Dr Padmini Prasad said HIV among pregnant women in Karnataka is 2%. “This is an alarming figure given that the percentage should be less than 1. Immediate measures have to be taken to prevent the spread of the infection,” she said. Noting that increasing number young women are falling prey to the deadly virus, Dr Padmini maintained that at least 50% of HIV-infected are in the age group of 15-24 years. “Youth are becoming more vulnerable due to physical, psychological and social attributes of adolescents. India is faced with the daunting task of prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS and overcoming the stigma is also a challenge,” she explained. To contain the disease from spreading, she underlined that services should be made youth-friendly. Apart from easy accessibility, there should be consistent and correct use of condoms. MATERNAL HEALTH About maternal mortality in the state, Dr Sheela Mane, chairperson, Safe Motherhood Committee and vice president, Fulfilling People’s Aspirations said that the mortality rate is 213 per lakh population. “This has to be brought down to at least 100 by 2015,” she added.

Besides, addicts would be motivated to shed use of syringes as the same could trigger HIV infection. Health employees are already being trained in this connection. A couple of days back, an inspection was conducted at Civil Hospital by NACO officials in the city. In the inspection, along with the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre, blood bank was checked. It was decided to start the oral substitution therapy for intravenous drug users (IDU). Under this programme, oral medicines would be given to all drug users to help them kick the habit. This would also help in reducing the risk of HIV transmission from one intravenous drug user to another. Needles are a predominant mode of spread of HIV. And addicts often stop caring about sharing of needles, resulting in a higher risk of contracting HIV. A few weeks back, a study was conducted by an NGO Rising Youth, wherein it was revealed 75% truck drivers visit commercial sex workers and syringes are commonly used by them. What is more alarming is that only 10% of these drivers use precautions like contraceptives. Another study, one done by Ludhiana Citizen Council, revealed that during pre-AIDS prevention intervention, it was found only 17% of the respondents had heard of HIV/AIDS and were not aware of modes of its transmission and symptoms. Dr Geetika, district AIDS control programme officer, said this is the latest advancement, which National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is undertaking with respect to intravenous drug use so as to reduce the risk of HIV infection. Under the oral substitution method, medicines would be given so as to control and avoid chances of HIV spread among addicts. She added: ""It is expected that the programme will take off soon as staff has already been sent for related training to Chandigarh."" "

This figure includes 154 pregnant women. Notably, it is only those patients who reported at government centres. There could be several more undetected HIV+ve cases in the district. According to resident deputy collector Pramod Bhusari, these cases were found at 19 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) situated in the district. Bhusari revealed this while briefing reporters on International Youth Day celebrations to be held on August 12. He said a rally would be organised to create awareness about HIV among youngsters and to make district HIV free. ""It is duty of every student to create awareness about HIV among rural women, as they are more vulnerable to the killer disease,"" he said. Bhusari said that during January 1 to July 31, blood samples of 41,451 persons were tested for HIV in the district. Of these, 2079 persons were found HIV positive. Similarly, blood samples of 35,901 pregnant women were examined. Of these, 154 were found HIV positive. He said the district health administration has given target to test blood samples of 82,000 persons while 65,000 ante-natal cases are to be examined. Strangely, the health department has no figures of patients' dying of AIDS. The persons whose blood samples are tested include pregnant women, TB patients, sexual disease cases and suspected HIV cases referred by doctors from various hospitals. Bhusari urged people to avoid unsafe sex, used syringes, and transfusion of blood from professional donors as these are main ways of transmission of HIV. He also urged barbers to use new blades for each customer. "

47,8,2010,'Ayurveda hope for HIV+ patients',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Ayurveda-hope-for-HIV-patients/articleshow/6301955.cms," MUMBAI: With no cure in sight for the dreaded HIV, scientists across the globe are working towards drugs to prolong the life-span of afflicted patients. An ongoing study by the KEM Hospital to find out the efficacy of ayurvedic drugs in improving the life expectancy of HIV positive patients has yielded some positive results. The medicine department of the hospital has been studying the potency of an ayurvedic drug on 700 HIV patients since April last year. After little more than a year, the institute found a significant boost in the count of CD4 cells in these patients, and also that it could probably push the initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), known to have many side-effects, by a few years. The count of CD4 cells is directly proportional to the health of a person for these cells are the most important part of one's immune system. Anyone with less CD4 count is more prone to ailments as the body's defence mechanism starts giving way. The ART for HIV patients is started only after the CD4 count falls below 250. After administering the ayurvedic drug, the doctors found that the CD4 count in patients on an average went up from 448 to 546 within six months and up to 590 in a year's time. Besides, many patients had weight gains, increase in haemoglobin count and a sense of well-being. Claiming that it spells a lot of promise, head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that not every patient who tests positive for HIV immediately qualifies for the ART drugs. ""Till a patient's CD4 count comes down to 250, we cannot prescribe ART. But patients show apprehension to go back home without medicines, especially after they are found positive for such a dreaded ailment,'' he said. Moreover, ART has side-effects like pain in abdomen, weakening of limbs and arms, swollen abdomen and distortion of facial features. Therefore, Pazare believes that patients could be prescribed some ayurvedic drugs with immuno-restorative properties that can delay the initiation of ART. ""Our assumption is that ayurvedic drugs with properties to strengthen immunity can delay the ART therapy by at least four years,'' said Pazare. ""And later, as the patient is put on ART, he can survive for a few more decades,'' he added. The KEM hospital study will be on for the next five years. However, the study solely focused on CD4 cells and did not check if the drug could bring down the viral load in a patient. Another hitch remains that ayurvedic drugs cannot be consumed simultaneously with the ART drugs. Speaking on the use of alternative therapies, head of ART department of JJ Hospital Dr Alaka Deshpande said nations across the globe were looking for indigenous medicines for HIV. ""Even in India, more systematic studies are required as there is no standardised data that talks about long-term effects,'' she said. Yet, she added that it may not be a bad idea to put patients on ayurvedic medicines with proven benefits till they are ideal candidates for ART. "
48,8,2010,HIV victims positively unwelcome,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/HIV-victims-positively-unwelcome/articleshow/6310200.cms," Harjeet is no different from the thousands of Punjab villagers who dream of a well-paying job in the Gulf. In 1995, he applied for a work visa, forking out Rs 20,000 to an agent in Mumbai. A mandatory medical check followed and all the doctor would tell him was that ""something is wrong"" with his blood test results. He offered however to help suppress information for a ""commission"" of Rs 2,000. The expenses cost Harjeet a loan but he managed to fly to Saudi Arabia. On arrival, he was subjected to another medical test. To his shock, he was soon after whisked away to an isolated cell and jailed there for a day. The next day he was taken to a court which ordered his deportation. Harjeet, it seems, had tested HIV-positive . Back in India, Harjeet found that his wife had walked out of the family home with their two children. He was packed off to a care centre and left alone to deal with his situation. Severely depressed, Harjeet began getting multiple seizures that left him partially paralysed . He eventually recovered with a lot of support from the care centre. Today, Harjeet works with people who are HIV-positive and his life story has been documented by the International Aids Society (IAS). Harjeet is not alone. Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive . This is despite the fact that stigmatising HIV-positive individuals is contrary to effective public health programming. Official data shows that 66 countries, territories and areas deny entry, stay or residence to HIV-positive individuals: of these, 26 deport migrants who test positive, seven refuse permission to stay beyond a certain time bar and six deny entry even for very short-term stay. ""It is incomprehensible that HIV-related entry and residency restrictions still exist,"" says Kevin Moody, International Coordinator and CEO, Global Network of People Living with HIV. ""These restrictions are in blatant violation of human rights, they stimulate stigma and discrimination and actually hurt the response to the HIV epidemic."" India's health secretary, K Sujatha Rao, believes that irrational discriminatory laws should be lifted. ""In India, we don't have any laws against residence or visit by HIV patient,"" she points out. Many of these restrictions, says the IAS, were imposed in the early days of the epidemic, when there was a great deal of ignorance, fear and prejudice surrounding the subject. At that time, many governments saw these laws as an attempt to ""protect the public health"" and avoid the potential costs of care. The situation has, however, changed dramatically. There is a lot of information available about the disease and its prevention and the antiretroviral treatment can extend the life span of those who are HIV positive. Dr Helene Gayle, chief advisor to US president Barack Obama on HIV/AIDS, points out that these restrictive laws are no longer justified by concerns about public health. ""Over 60 countries around the world have a variety of HIV-specific laws that restrict the entry, stay or residence of people living with HIV including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Qatar, Oman, Russia, Colombia , South Korea, Yemen and Armenia ,"" says Dr Gayle. According to IAS executive director Craig McClure, scientific evidence shows that travel restrictions against those who are HIV-infected make for ineffective prevention tools. ""These laws are not consistent with current scientific knowledge, best practices in public health and humanitarian principles. They sustain a culture of exclusion, rights violations and marginalisation that impedes an effective response to the epidemic,"" says McClure. A WHO statement points out that such entry restrictions actually pressurise people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. ""Furthermore, because drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" says the statement. In the Asia and the Pacific region, countries have different kinds of restrictive laws for the HIV-affected . Singapore has an outright ban on all HIV-positive non-nationals for entry and immigration. Brunei targets HIV-positive foreigners for deportation. Australia requires HIV testing for permanent visa applicants over the age of 15. South Korea announced changes to its entry and immigration policy on January 1, 2010, but clarifications on its amended laws are still unclear. Some countries ask applicants to indicate their HIV status, some seek confirmation of HIV-negative test results and others insist on testing as a part of a mandatory medical exam for those seeking work permits. Things are however changing. The US, China and Namibia recently lifted their decades old travel laws against HIV-positive people. Hopefully, others will follow suit,and soon. "
49,8,2010,Singer admits not telling sex partners she's HIV+,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/Singer-admits-not-telling-sex-partners-shes-HIV/articleshow/6321890.cms,"DARMSTADT (GERMANY): German pop star Nadja Benaissa admitted on the opening day of her trial on Monday not telling sexual partners, with whom she had unprotected sex, that she was HIV positive. ""I am so sorry,"" the contrite-looking 28-year-old told the court in Darmstadt. She denied intending to infect anyone with the virus. Benaissa, a member of the all-female pop group No Angels, was arrested last April just as she was about to perform at a Frankfurt nightclub and spent 10 days in custody before being released. In February this year she was charged with causing bodily harm. If convicted Benaissa faces between six months and 10 years in prison. A verdict is due on on August 26. According to the charge sheet, she had sex on five occasions between 2000 and 2004 with three people and did not tell them she was infected, even though she had known since 1999. One of the three had since been confirmed as being infected with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, prosecutors had said. No Angels shot to fame in 2000 thanks to a TV talent show and had a string of hits in central Europe before splitting up in 2003. They reformed in 2007 and competed in the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The singer, who has an 11-year-old daughter, has not yet developed the symptoms of AIDS. "

So, even though it took her some time, this 28-year-old woman, who is HIV positive as is her six-year-old daughter, managed to convince the villagers of Longe, Kolhapur, that neither she nor her daughter are a threat to society. This August, the Longe gram panchayat ""respectfully requested her to return as an anganwadi worker and allowed her daughter to attend the village school."" The woman told TOI, ""I am relieved that I can live with dignity. This is an important win."" It all started in early 2009. Sanjeevani Kulkarni, founder-president of NGO Prayas, that works for the uplift and fair treatment of the HIV-affected, narrated the woman's story. ""Her husband was first detected with HIV in early 2009 at the village primary healthcare centre. She too underwent the test. Both the woman and her daughter tested positive, though her older son did not,"" she said. "" When the villagers came to know their status, they were not uncooperative. They helped the family in many ways."" Eventually, the woman's husband passed away in late 2009. Though she continued to be in good health several eyebrows were raised at the fact that she was an anganwadi sevika. ""Parents were worried that her proximity to their children would prove detrimental to their health and well-being and that her little daughter would pass on the infection to other children in the village school. Now these worries are neither scientific nor logical. Nevertheless, she was asked to stay home with the promise that her salary would be sent to her. Her daughter was denied admission to the school. When this state of existence was unacceptable to her, the woman left the village with her children,"" Kulkarni said. She went to Mumbai this June and got in touch with the media, as well as various NGOs that work for the HIV positive. Her voice was heard and gradually the wheels of hope began spinning once again, especially when tehsildar Vijaya Jadhav got to know of the situation. A meeting with the gram sabha of Longe village was initiated. Officials from the district HIV programme, various NGOs like the Network of Positive People, Lotus Medical Foundation, Red Cross Society, Sakhi Sanghatan and Jeevan Jyot, as well as members of the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society were present. At the meeting, Sanjeevani Kulkarni and Pravin Naik, district HIV programme officer, Kolhapur, put to rest every niggling suspicion and query in the villagers' mind. ""The meeting lasted for over two hours, and we were successful in convincing the villagers that the woman and her child were far from being a threat,"" said Kulkarni. ""The villagers promised to look after her and her daughter in every way."" Drupada Kumhare, sarpanch of Longe, said, ""We are convinced that there is no way that one can get infected with HIV just by coexisting with a positive person."" Deputy sarpanch Subhash Patil said, ""We were afraid that our children could get infected if her daughter would play with them. But now we know that there is no such chance."" A village-level committee comprising the sarpanch, deputy sarpanch as well as members of the village conflict redressal committee will support the woman. ""She is in good health. And so far, there has been no need for anti-retroviral therapy for her,"" added Kulkarni. "
51,8,2010,HIV in semen different from virus in blood,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/HIV-in-semen-different-from-virus-in-blood/articleshow/6384335.cms," WASHINGTON: Scientists claim to have found evidence that HIV-1 in semen is different from HIV-1 in blood, possibly due to changes the virus undergoes in the male genital tract. To better understand the process by which HIV is transmitted, experts compared the gene encoding the major surface protein of HIV in semen and blood. ""In some men, the virus population in semen was similar to that in the blood, suggesting that virus was being imported from the blood into the genital tract and not being generated locally in the genital tract. ""We found two mechanisms that significantly altered the virus population in the semen, showing that virus can grow in the seminal tract in two different ways,"" Ronald Swanstrom of North Carolina University, who led the team, said. In one way, one or more viruses grow rapidly in the seminal tract over a short period such that the viral population in semen is homogeneous as compared to the population in the blood. In the other way, the virus replicates in T cells in the seminal tract over a long period, creating a separate population of virus in semen that is distinct from the blood virus. "

But their systems have been battling the deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) right from birth. Sneha Care Home makes all efforts to ensure their dreams are not crippled. Though HIV is an increasingly thriving menace in our society, little thought is spared for children who suffer after their parents fall victim to it. For no fault of their's, they are left to face the extreme bitterness of living with the disease. With treatment options expanding, issues about their future get more complex. Sneha Care Home (SCH) stepped in to address these issues. Started on July 14, 2008, SCH and Shining Star School address multiple issues of children infected with HIV, as well as prepare them for a productive and constructive life. ""Now with treatment options increasing dramatically, the life span of HIV-infected has also gone up, making us think of their future too,"" says Fr Mathew Perumpil, director of Sneha Care Home. ""When they grow up and become sexually active, they become potentially dangerous in transmitting the virus. Initially, we used to send our children to nearby schools. Once a teacher in the school noticed one of our boys growing intimate with a girl from his class and alerted us. We were totally unprepared to handle such a situation. That is when we started this new venture with 20 children where they are given value-based education,"" he adds. Now SCH houses 83 children who are below 12 years of age, including 34 girls. Most of them were orphaned due to the deadly HIV and many are with single parent. ""We choose kids from houses where the environment is not conducive for their healthy growth. We take away the burden of bringing up the children from suffering families,"" says Perumpil. Children are educated at the Shining Star School on their premises which ensures a good value system. The school, based on National Open School Curriculum, focuses on encouraging creativity and auditing the aptitude of these children. ""We want them to enter a good profession which is less physically taxing and that will define their self-esteem to live a life full of hope and meaning,"" says Perumpil. The tiny bundles of energy who run around here prove these points. With a smile on their lips and stars in their eyes, they are surging ahead in life. Ten-year-old Varalakshmi wants to become a nurse when she grows up. Ask her why: ""I want to take care of others,"" she quips. Puneet Kumar, 11, wants to be a farmer and is already willing to look after the vegetable garden at SCH. To ensure that these kids don't miss anything in life, SCH sends them to foster homes for holidays. ""We identify and screen the family before sending the children,"" says Perumpil. With all the care and affection from SCH, these children are better equipped to face their future with a smile. "
53,8,2010,Need tailormade counselling for HIV+,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Need-tailormade-counselling-for-HIV/articleshow/6398055.cms," CHENNAI: Their future had appeared bleak. With no medical treatment or hope of life, HIV positive children had little to look forward to. But more than two decades after the deadly disease was first detected in Chennai, several babies now have a chance of survival into adulthood thanks to medical regimen and better nutrition. When the Indian government began the national Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV patients in 2004, the programme was a godsend to many infected patients who had even given up on the idea of survival. ""Before the ART programme began, morbidity and mortality rate for HIV positive patients were high,"" says Dr P Manorama, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), who runs a home for HIV positive children in Chennai. Today, mortality levels have significantly reduced, from 13 % in 2005 to 8 % in 2010, according to the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). But all the medical and financial aid given by the government is not enough to offset the need for emotional support for the patients, especially children infected with HIV. According to statistics furnished by TANSACS, there are 11,197 children living with HIV in the state today and a sizeable number among them are adolescents. Daisy David of World Vision, an NGO working with HIV positive teenagers, says there is a large segment of children born with the disease, who have today reached their adolescence. ""Children living with HIV have the same exposure to society and media as other children,"" she points out. ""They too grow up with ambitions and desires. However, the discussions provided by the government are inadequate. They not only need counseling on career ambitions and how to battle life on the professional front, but also on the changes their bodies undergo and their own desires regarding sex, marriage and companionship."" Counselling HIV teenagers about marriage and companionship is rather difficult. ""There is need for counsellors who are equipped to handle all kinds of issues and emotions,"" says Dr.Lakshmibai, project director for Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative (TAI). ""Many of them would like to marry non-infected persons, so there is always the issue of acceptance and rejection,"" says Daisy, who had recently attended a workshop for HIV-infected adolescents in Manipur. ""At Manipur, I met a teenaged boy who was battling rejection after his girlfriend found out he was HIV positive. They all had questions as to whether they could have sexual intercourse with non-infected persons, whether the babies born out of such a bonding would also be infected. The very fact that they needed to ask these questions shows that they are not receiving this kind of information or counselling."" The other issue that social workers stress on is a tailor-made counselling program for drug adherence. According to statistics furnished by the TNSAC, until June 2010, 3,298 people had not returned to their respective ART centres for their regular treatment for a period of one to three months. And 1,192 persons had not returned to the ART centres for treatment in a period of one to three months. "

The incident came to light after the woman told about her plight to other patients of a nearby ward. The 25-year-old woman was admitted to KGH by a voluntary organisation on Aug 20 and she gave birth to a baby girl the very next day. While the baby is doing well, the doctors at the gynaecology ward stopped attending to the woman and the baby after coming to know about her HIV-positive status. Shockingly, the woman's husband, a daily wage worker, has also left her after learning that she was afflicted with the deadly virus. ""Neither have my parents nor in-laws come to see me. I don't want to live any more as no one is ready to help me and my child,"" she cried. She belongs to Palasa in Srikakulam district. A pregnant woman hailing from Bhimili, who is also HIV-positive, said the doctors and the staff were not attending to them. ""We do not know how we contracted the virus. But the doctors and the society continue to shun us for no fault of ours,"" she complained. When contacted, KGH superintendent Santaram said an enquiry has been ordered following complaints from HIV-positive patients. ""We are trying to make every medication available for them. The mother and the child would be discharged from the hospital soon as they are doing well,"" he claimed. Meanwhile, swine flu scare has gripped the pregnant women in KGH. With the authorities setting up an exclusive swine flu ward close to the gynaecology ward, all the pregnant women are worried about the welfare of their children. ""How could they be so foolish to set up the swine flu ward next to the gynaecology ward? We are all worried,"" a woman, who is into her advanced stages of pregnancy, said. A six-bed swine flu ward has been set up and already two pregnant women of Vizianagaram suspected to be carrying the H1N1 virus were admitted there. Sources said nearly 50 mothers of new-born babies and pregnant women in the gynaecology ward have been living in fear ever since the swine flu ward came into being. However, the authorities of KGH said the special ward was established since the communicable diseases hospital where swine flu cases are being treated does not have full-fledged facilities to treat pregnant women infected with H1N1 virus. Santaram told TOI that a decision to set up the special ward was taken only after consultations with the higher authorities. Allaying fears of the women, he said: ""The patients in the gynaecology wing need not worry as we have taken every precaution."" Swine flu has so far claimed six lives in the city and the north coastal districts in the last one month. "

This shocking incident happened at Rao's English medium private school in Vidyuthnagar area in Anantapur on Tuesday. Angry parents forced the school management to send her out after photographs of her HIV-positive mother and stepfather were splashed in local media a few days ago. Though no medical tests had confirmed that the girl was HIV-positive, the irate parents, who have been staging protests outside the school, forcibly took the girl to a private clinic where the staff refused to conduct medical tests on her. Later, they took her to the government hospital. They insisted that the girl be sent out immediately. It all started when the girl's mother M Lakshmi Devi married another HIV-positive patient K Khader Vali on Aug 20 at the Congress office here in the presence of agriculture minister N Raghuveera Reddy and MP A Venkatrami Reddy on the occasion of Rajiv Gandhi's birth anniversary. The girl was the daughter of Devi and M Kiran Kumar of Pulivendula in Kadapa district. Kiran migrated to Anantapur and worked as a room boy in a lodge. He was diagnosed as HIV-positive three years ago and died in March this year. Devi took shelter at a private NGO since then and the NGO head Usharani, who herself is HIV-positive, convinced Devi to enter into a wedlock with Vali. But with the HIV-positive couple's marriage receiving wide coverage in the local media, the parents swooped on the school and forcibly sent out the poor girl. While Usharani urged the district officials to take stringent action against the erring parents, district educational officer D Premanadam and II Town inspector A Srinivasulu went to the school to convince the parents. When contacted, school correspondent Madhav Rao said they have no objection to the girl studying since she has not tested positive for HIV. ""Why should the poor girl be harassed for no fault of hers,"" Usharani questioned. "

It will be voluntary for the two-crore-plus workforce in private establishments and factories to undergo HIV test, but the policy will ensure that no one faces stigma or is given the pink slip if tested positive. The policy may also pave the way for employees to receive financial support from their employers for treatment, which is expensive. Stating that the policy will be introduced in three months, Maharshtra labour secretary Kavita Gupta said, ""We are fine-tuning a policy that will ensure that there is no discrepancy to any of the person with HIV at his workplace. It will provide employment and social security to HIV-positive persons."" Labour minister Hasan Mushrif said, ""Many of the unions requested the labour department to conduct HIV test for the labourers. The proposal is under consideration. The decision is yet to be taken on the issue."" Incidentally, the first case of AIDS was reported in Mumbai in 1986. According to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), 14 districts of Maharashtra figure in the all-India list of 49 districts with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. There are nearly two crore labourers (excluding farm and domestic workers) in Maharashtra. According to the state labour department, it will be mandatory for all the factories and establishments to adopt the HIV-friendly workplace policy. However, it will be the labourer's discretion whether he/she wants to undergo an HIV test. Those workers who opt for the HIV check-up and test positive can avail the benefit of the policy. ""Those who do not turn up for the check-up will be deprived of the benefits,"" said a health official. Justifying department's move, Gupta said, ""The aim is not to get information on number of HIV-afflicted labourers. Its aim is to provide financial stability (employment) and social security to those who test positive."" She said the introduction of the policy will help earlier detection of HIV. ""Earlier the detection, better the chances of healthy survival of the victim,"" said Gupta. "

""Out of 130 registered HIV positive patients (pregnant women) in the department, as many as 80 women have already witnessed safe deliveries,"" claimed Sulekha Pandey of department of obstetrics and gynaecology, BHU, during a press conference on Saturday. Similarly, around 13,000 pregnant women have already undergone HIV tests in the past five years after it was made mandatory by the department, she added.

And, Varanasi is supposed to be one of the main centres of HIV infected persons due to its migrant population. ""In Varanasi district alone, there are over 1,000 persons infected with HIV and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP,"" informed secretary, Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (commonly known as BNP+), Sunil Seth. The network is spread over 30 districts of the state with active members to motivate and help HIV persons to lead a purposeful life. However, according to WHO report, over 34 million people are living with HIV and AIDS across the world. India alone, with 2.3 million cases of HIV, has the third highest number of HIV affected persons in the world. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), around 3,22,521 persons were taking treatment for AIDS by April 2010. And, to give a new lease of life to such persons, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. ""So far, 11,321 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU,"" said Dr Jaya of the centre. ""Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines,"" she added. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and the only in Uttar Pradesh, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It monitors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. It is also a training and research centre. According to the doctor, those patients registered in ART centre of BHU, who have completed six month's therapy and are stable and have increasing CD4 count, can be referred to Link ART centres affiliated to BHU ART centre established in the neighbouring districts of Ballia, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Mau, Sonebhadra, Bhadohi, Chandauli and Azamgarh. They are basically drug distribution centres. Beside the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) centre, Shiv Prasad Gupta District Hospital Kabirchoura, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Regional Hospital Pandeypur and Central Jail Hospital Sivpur are other centres where free HIV investigation is available under NACO supervision. The crux of the whole exercise is to protect precious human life. The doctor says if by mistake one deviates and acquires this disease, he should not lose courage. He should get investigated and should take proper medicine and advice from the health personnel. An early diagnosis of HIV status helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, or he starts and stops the drugs abruptly, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV infected person can live a productive and healthy life if he takes care of his health, eating habits and lifestyle. Vital Facts What is HIV? Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus, which damages the body's immune system by destroying CD4+lymphocutes. This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections. How it spreads HIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, hand shaking, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person. In India, it is migrant population, truck drivers, community sex workers and IV drug abusers who are affected. They, in turn, spread the disease to their wives, children and clients. Clinical presentation Within a few weeks of being infected, some people get fever, headache, sore muscles and joints, stomach ache, swollen lymph glands or a skin rash for one or two weeks. Most people think it is flu. After the initial illness, patients can remain symptom free for many years (3-10 years), as the CD4 cell count decreases and the immunity decreases the patient first gets minor infection then the severity of infection increases. The last stage of HIV infection is when the CD4 decreases below 200 per micro litre is called AIDS when the patient may succumb to minor illness. How to get tested If any person wants to get himself tested for HIV, he should go to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) which provides free testing and counselling. The ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. If a person tests positive, he is referred to the nearest anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre. Treatment Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available that can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be started on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment, if started, has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment so as to prevent failure of the drug regimen. Where to go for treatment The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme in India through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) hospital of BHU provides free HIV testing, treatment, counselling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients.

64,9,2010,Faiths take on common foe - HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/Faiths-take-on-common-foe-HIV/articleshow/6648665.cms," BANGALORE: AIDS has no religion, it’s human — this was the unanimous message conveyed at the Art of Living ashram on Monday and Tuesday. A two-day inter-faith summit organized by the foundation on HIV and AIDS was attended by religious leaders from across the country and abroad. One could sense the country’s religious diversity in the ashram and also leaders’ unity to fight against the common enemy. ""Even today, in rural India, religious leaders have a say. If it comes from them, people meticulously follow it. If they remain ignorant about it and keep condemning the HIV-positive, there will be more stigma,"" said Sri Sri Ravishankar. Leaders included that of Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Jainism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and representatives from different states. They signed a declaration to remove stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV. ""We have committed ourselves to create awareness about it. We will spend 5-7 minutes to speak positively about HIV. We will publicly go into houses of HIV-positive people and associate with them. We ourselves will get tested to keep track of our HIV status,"" said Rev J P Heath, a leader living with HIV. ""In a country like this, how much ever doctors get involved, the stigma won’t go without the involvement of people,"" he added. As many as 15 regional bodies have been formed to fight for the cause. Each will consist of leaders from different religions who will work together towards this end. ""Hindu swamis will work together with maulanas and Fathers. It will be a common platform for them to work,"" said Sri Sri. Laterm the groups will work on other pressing issues like alcoholism and female foeticide. MEET THIS LEADER J P Heath, founder of INERELA+, an international inter-faith network of religious leaders — both lay and ordained — living with HIV, spoke about his experiences. An Anglican priest, he found he was HIV-positive 11 years ago. ""I faced many a stigma myself. The first was self-stigma — the fear that you will be rejected by society. Many people do not survive this stage. In the second stage, I was wondering what will happen when the Bishop finds out. I thought I’ll be kicked out of the House. Pressure and stress are not good for HIV. I told him, and he said you can continue working but do not tell anybody else,"" he said. Heath later raised awareness among his congregation about HIV and when he finally said he was positive, they asked him what was wrong about it. ""HIV does not rob you of your skills and potentials. Around 10,000 interface religious leaders are part of this network,"" he said. ""Religious leaders are humans. They are not divorced from the reality of life. There’s an additional level of stigma because HIV is associated with immoral sex. They are vulnerable to HIV because they work amidst them. Cases like blood transfusion, tattoos and marriage can be the reasons,"" he said. INERELA+ was launched in 2008 and its prevention strategy has been adopted in a couple of countries. "
65,9,2010,2.6L HIV patients have no access to treatment,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-6L-HIV-patients-have-no-access-to-treatment/articleshow/6655336.cms," NEW DELHI: Around 3.2 lakh HIV patients in India were on life-saving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in December 2009 — more than 85,000 patients from the previous year. Be that as it may, 2.6 lakh people are still in dire need of ART. According to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) latest report, “Towards Universal Access”, which tracks progress in achieving the 2010 target for HIV prevention, treatment and care; around 5.8 lakh HIV patients required ART in end-2009. Globally, the HIV epidemic continued to be a real public health challenge as around 33.4 million people are suffering from the lethal disease. In 2008 alone, 2.7 million people were newly infected with the virus. According to the report, only one-third of HIV patients have been put on ART, and coverage of prevention interventions is largely inadequate. This year, WHO’s revised guidelines on ART for adults and adolescents, including would-be mothers, said ART would be initiated when CD4 cell counts reach or drop below 350 cells/mm3, irrespective of whether the patients have clinical symptoms. As per this count, though an estimated 11 -14 lakh HIV patients in India need ART, only 23% are receiving the treatment. The number of pregnant women, who require ART, is pegged at 43,000. But only 21% are covered. Another 30,000-76,000 HIV positive children, too, require ART. However, there has been a spurt in the number of HIV tests across the world. For instance, 100 countries had tested 67 million people last year. In 82 countries — for which comparable data was available for 2008 and 2009 — the median number of tests performed per 1,000 people had increased from 41 to 50, respectively. ART coverage, among young adults less than 15 years, has gone up from 22% in 2008 to 28% in 2009. Even the percentage of HIV positive pregnant women receiving ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission has increased from 45% in 2008 to 53% in 2009. In end-2009, 5.25 million people were receiving ART in low and middle-income countries, including India, which translates to an increase of over 1.2 million people from the previous year. The report maintains that HIV-related TB remains a cause for concern. In 2008, of the 9.4 million TB cases reported worldwide, an estimated 1.4 million were diagnosed among HIV patients. Though the rate of HIV test and counselling for TB patients is rising, the initiative is insufficient. "
66,10,2010,HIV numbers rise behind bars,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/HIV-numbers-rise-behind-bars/articleshow/6661393.cms," HYDERABAD: State prisons are turning into HIV hubs with a three-fold rise in the number of fresh HIV cases detected in various prisons this year. Figures collated by a state government body which works closely with HIV positive persons throws up the alarming fact: as against the 119 prisoner from across the state who tested positive for HIV in 2009, the count this year has touched 362 as on date. The period between April to August this year alone saw the number touch the 239 mark. Also, HIV accounts for 30 per cent of the average 100-120 prison deaths each year in the state. More alarming is the fact that these figures are only approximate. For, there is no mandatory HIV screening of prisoners at the time of admission and thus officials admit that they are not aware of HIV status of many inmates in various state prisons. “Some persons consider HIV tests to be taboo and do not give their consent to be screened. Even though they belong to the high risk group, their status remains unknown,” said R V Chandravadan, project director of AP state AIDS control society (APSACS). With rampant instances of men having sex with men (MSM) once they are secluded from mainstream society and confined to their barracks, this figure is a fair indicator of the vulnerability of other prisoners, which is now manifest in the form of diseases. “A large number of them are presently suffering from genital ulcer disease (GUD) which results from having unnatural forms of sex. Once diagnosed with such diseases, they become ten times more susceptible to acquiring AIDS at a later date,” said a medical practitioner who recently visited and interacted with medical officers of two central prisons in the state. With APSACS having introduced its ‘Raksha’ project in state prisons in February last year as part of which prisoners are screened and those carrying the HIV infection sent for treatment, the mechanism is presently in place. But no decision has been taken yet by the prison authorities to keep a check on the HIV positive count once APSACS concludes its intervention programme next year. “Habitual offenders who keep coming back to prison for petty crimes often indulge in unsafe sex outside and have multiple partners thus posing a threat to other inmates,’’ said a prison superintendent.

Eight-year-old Debnath, the elder of the two sons of Barnali and Nil Madhab of Hanturia village near Howrah, finally lit his father's pyre around 3pm under heavy police protection after health officials failed to convince the villagers. Nil Madhab, a truck driver was 32 when he was detected HIV+ three years ago. Since then, he has been undergoing treatment at NRS Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata. His condition gradually deteriorated. Last Sunday night when Barnali went to check out Nil Madhab's condition, she found him dead. ""I tried to rub his hand but it was cold. I realized he had passed away in sleep. Since it was late in the night, all I could do was wait for dawn so that I could inform neighbours,"" Barnali said. When neighbours learnt about Nil Madhab's death, they began gathering before his house, not to extend help, but confabulate on what to do. Soon, a 1,200-strong mob gathered with some demanding Nil Madhab's body be taken away from the village as it was ""contaminated"". ""I sought their help. Not only did they refuse to carry the body to the burning ghat at Memari, some of them said they would not allow his cremation there,"" said Barnali. "
68,10,2010,International Conference on alcohol &HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/events/delhi/International-Conference-on-alcohol-HIV/articleshow/6713295.cms,"The Second International Conference on Alcohol and HIV, which was held recently at the India Habitat Centre, has called for multilevel community based approaches for combating pervasive alcohol use and the resulting HIV transmission.A special emphasis during the discussion was on gender norms. The researchers emphasised the need to produce greater gender equality and to shift norms that place aggression, violence and sexual exploitation within the masculine domain and are aggravated under the influence of alcohol. Ongoing research in different countries suggests that women’s risk of gender-based and sexual violence is also increased by their partner’s alcohol consumption. Therefore, without addressing gender issues, efforts to reduce alcohol-related sexual-risk behaviour might only be partly successful. Speaking at the conference, Dr Ravi Verma, regional director, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), said, “Gender is missing from many alcohol related as well as HIV related interventions. Interventions of any kind in the development sector must be conscientious of gender. Failure to do so may reinforce existing discrimination against women and girls.” According to him, the majority of people who go for paid sex are problem drinkers and that they don’t even use condoms. Some of the eminent researchers and subject experts who participated in the conference included Dr Kendall Bryant, director, Alcohol and HIV/AIDS Research, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Dr Jean J. Schensul, founding director, Institute for Community Research and Dr KS Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. The revelations of the studies presented by the key researchers prove that alcohol plays a direct and indirect role in promoting situations and decisions leading to unprotected sex with multiple partners in the general population and in vulnerable populations including mobile workers, and female sex workers, and those infected with HIV. The conference was organised by ICRW, in partnership with the Public Health Foundation of India, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Institute for Community Research. They had brought together programme specialists and researchers from India and neighbouring South Asian countries as well as US researchers working in India. "

To prevent this transmission, the State Aids Control Society (SACS), Chandigarh, has started providing free milk powder to the HIV-positive mothers until the child is six months. It is expected to benefit around 100 such women. Out of the 1,176 registered positives in the city, 200 are women of reproductive age. SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta says, “Breastfeeding can transmit the virus to a child. We advise continuity of whatever milk a child is on. In case, a positive mother is unable to continue feeding the infant before it turns six months and makes it drink processed one, it develops infection.” “The mothers need not bother about how to sustain the life of their young one as the free supply will continue until the baby turns six months. At the time of anti-retroviral therapy, we screen out expectant mothers who can avail this scheme from their nearest integrated counselling and testing centres,?”she adds. The SACS has roped in a few NGOs to manage finances for the purpose. It is only after a doctor clinically decides the criteria of which patient can breastfeed, the milk tin is given, states Dr Archana Mohan of SACS. HIV can spread from a mother to her infant during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. When milk powder feed is followed by breastfeed, the lining of the baby’s intestine is destroyed. This makes it susceptible to HIV, warns Dr Vanita. Most of the positives are unable to afford this nutrient. The virus disables them to work and earn livelihood. This small initiative can make some difference for them. Recently, three mothers have received the benefit of the scheme, said Pooja Thakur, president of the People living with HIV/AIDS. "

Balaram Patra, 33, from the far-flung seaside Talchua village, who was later tested negative in the government-run diagnostic centre, has drawn the attention of police and health authorities to the issue. Health authorities have ordered a departmental probe into the incident, while an FIR has been lodged against the diagnostic centre and the self-styled doctor, officials said. The unsavoury episode lends credence to the oft-repeated charge that quacks are running parallel health service network in this coastal district. ""My life had taken a turn towards the worse after an erroneous medical report found me carrying HIV/AIDS virus. The government-run public health centre (PHC) at Talchua has become defunct and no doctor is turning up here,"" Patra, a local businessman, said. ""When I was suffering from fever and pain in the joints last month, I sought medical advice from a self-styled doctor who has opened a clinic in the village. He tested blood samples and to my horror, I was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS,"" he said. To crosscheck the blood-test results, Patra got himself tested at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at Pattamundai run by state AIDS Control Society. ""Its an unfortunate incident. The diagnostic test report compiled by ICTC conclusively stated that the complainant was never infected with HIV virus,"" said Biraj Kumar Sahu, the chief district medical officer. "

After launching the Learning Site here on Tuesday, BIMS director Dr Chandrasekhar said the new initiative is bound to improve the quality of services being provided to HIV infected and affected. The capacity of counsellors and lab-technicians will be improved upon by series of training procedures, he added. District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) officer Kulkarni said counselling plays a major role in providing psycho-social support and ensures that clients are aware and empowered to access these services. In addition to counselling, system strengthening, process development and monitoring of referrals and back referrals, play an important part in ensuring continuous care and the aim of the learning sites will strengthen these systems he said. Dr Shankar, ART medical officer and Sunitha B J of KHPT were also present. "
73,10,2010,Hope rekindles for kids with HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Hope-rekindles-for-kids-with-HIV/articleshow/6844510.cms," CHANDIGARH: This Diwali will be unlike any other for some 175 kids who have grown up with the harsher realities of life. Children suffering from AIDS and kids of HIV-affected parents look forward to a Diwali which adds not just light and sweetness into their lives but also ushers in vibrant hues of carefree demeanour that make each day a celebration for these little angels. With an attempt to lighten up these 175 faces, People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLHA), an NGO, has collected Rs 50,000 from various religious and charitable trusts. The HIV-affected kids from the Tricity have their wishlist ready for the festival. Phuljharis, clothes, toys, shoes and sweets are all part of their idea of fun. ""We could have never collected such a huge amount for the occasion on our own. Some religious organizations have come forward to chip in for the cause,"" said Pooja Thakur, president of PLHA. ""These children include the ones suffering from HIV and those who lost their parents to AIDS. Most of the individual donors prefer anonymity. These donors consider lighting up the lives of HIV-affected kids a more auspicious gesture than paying visit to a temple on Diwali,"" said Pooja. The PLHA members say the amount will not be spent on Diwali alone. A part will be utilized for the treatment of these kids. ""We need money for medicines. A lot of time gets wasted in relying on the state machinery or central funding agencies. These voluntary aids are beneficial,"" noted Nawindu Jha, project coordinator at the drop-in-centre, State Aids Control. Most of these kids have no choice but to give up on hope as they are deprived of regular things in life. Expressing excitement, an HIV-affected teen said, ""I plan to burst a lot of crackers. I am also excited about the new clothes and shoes and can't wait for Diwali."" "
74,11,2010,HIV +ve cases rising alarmingly in Chanda,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/HIV-ve-cases-rising-alarmingly-in-Chanda/articleshow/6860006.cms," CHANDRAPUR: An alarming rise in the number of HIV positive cases was witnessed in the district during the last one-and-a-half years. Statistics showed that as many as 1,683 patients were detected positive for the deadly disease between April 2009 and August 2010. More disturbing fact is that the number of HIV positive pregnant women and newborn too has increased alarmingly. Chandrapur district is known for its tribal domination and Naxal influence. However, the town is gradually gaining new a identity of having most HIV victims. Figures obtained for Civil Hospital suggested that out of 32,651 people tested for HIV, as many as 1,123 (3.43%) were detected positive to the deadly diseases during 2009-10. The figure continued to rise in the current year. HIV tests on 19,089 patients in the next five months (up to end of August 2010) found 560 (2.93%) new patients in the district. Civil surgeon Dr Ramesh Bandebuche said that ""Even as our HIV/AIDS related awareness campaigns are on the number of HIV positive patients increased alarming in the recent past. Rise in HIV positive commercial sex workers is one of the main reasons for increase in the number of patients,"" said. He urged the people to have patience or take precautionary measures while visiting commercial sex workers. The health administration is also carrying out drives in red light areas to guide sex workers about necessity of using protective devises, he said. The rise in number of HIV positive pregnant women has disturbed the health authorities. HIV tests carried out on 23,033 ANC cases (pregnant women) showed 79 positive patients (0.34%) in 2009-10. In all, 81 newborns were HIV positive during the same period. Out of total of 47 babies (18-months-old) tested for HIV during last year, 10 of them were found positive to HIV. Similarly, a total of 15,350 pregnant women were tested for HIV between April and August and 28 (0.18%) of them were found positive. 21 newborn were positive to the disease. Out of 38 babies (18-month-old) tested for HIV, 5 were found positive during the same period. Figures suggest that HIV infection is also on the rise among pregnant women in the district. In majority of cases, infection comes from husband to wife, claimed health officials. Presently, a total of 1,613 HIV positive patients are taking treatment at ART centre in Civil Hospital here. "

77,11,2010,All HIV patients to get second-line treatment free,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/All-HIV-patients-to-get-second-line-treatment-free/articleshow/6915022.cms," NEW DELHI: All HIV patients put on first line antiretroviral therapy (ART) before 2004 but who became resistant to those drugs will now receive the life saving second line treatment free of cost from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). This is irrespective of whether the patients were receiving first line ART in a government centre or a private hospital. This major policy shift was finalised by NACO on Thursday night. Till now, NACO only provided second line treatment to those HIV patients who were part of its ART centres and had become resistant to first line drugs. Those patients on first line treatment in private hospitals or clinics were not eligible. Second line treatment is tremendously expensive and not affordable for the common man. Also, it was only available in NACO's ART centres. So, patients who did not get first line treatment in NACO's ART centres perished if they became resistant. Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam informed a Supreme Court Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia, Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar that the health ministry took this decision on Friday. He informed the SC that details of the decision would be intimated through an affidavit in two weeks. So what happens to those who were put on first line ART post-2004 but have become resistant to first line drugs? Expert committees in the 10 centres of excellence presently in charge of giving second line treatment will take a call. ART is the only known treatment that inhibits HIV. The drugs slow down the replication of HIV and immune deterioration is delayed leading to an improvement in the survival and quality of life. While first line drugs cost NACO Rs 5,000 per patient per year, second line cost them Rs 35,000 per patient per year. Patients, however, get the treatment free of charge. India is home to an estimated 2.3 million HIV patients of which 6 lakh would require to be on ART. At present, 3.55 lakh HIV patients are receiving first line treatment in 285 NACO ART centres. Ten centres have rolled out second line ART to 1,701 HIV patients. Five more centres in Nagpur, Pune, Salem, Aurangabad and Surat have been trained to start second line ART while two centres in Vijayawada and Hubli are being prepared. India rolled out second line ART for the first time on December 1, 2008 in Mumbai's J J Hospital and Chennai's Tambaram ART centre. Resistance to first line treatment mainly happens because of poor adherence to the treatment regimen. If not put on second line immediately, most of these patients die within a few years. A CD-4 count test is used to gauge immunity levels of an HIV-infected patient and to assess whether damage caused by the virus requires life-saving ART. The CD-4 count in healthy adults ranges from 500 to 1,500 cells per cubic millimetre of blood. In HIV infected people, it goes down by 60 cells per cubic millimetre of blood per year as HIV progresses. ART is administered when an HIV positive person registers a CD-4 count under 200. "
78,11,2010,Fight against HIV virus to don green hues,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/Fight-against-HIV-virus-to-don-green-hues/articleshow/6967143.cms," CHANDIGARH: It may just become possible to fight the dreaded HIV type 1 virus. And, a particular algae and herbal plant found in northern India would be the tool. This has recently been proved in a research of anti-HIV drug at National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Mohali in Punjab. The algae and herbal plant have chemicals with potent anti-viral structure. Imitating these structures, a compound has been synthesized to fight HIV type 1 virus. A patent has been filed as this is the first such compound which has shown a protection rate of 78.17% against the HIV virus (the standard percentage is 89.75). The project, which has been completed recently and collaborated with National Centre for Cell Science, Pune University, had been sponsored by the Department of Biotechnology, Delhi. The main objective behind developing such a compound was to introduce another set of compounds and their family which are not yet resistant to the HIV virus. The principal investigator of the project, Prof KK Bhutani said, “There are existing therapies, which have effectively suppressed the virus replication and prolonged the life of such patients. But there are mutant viruses resistant to the current drugs.” He added, “So, we took up this project of development of new types of anti-HIV drugs based on the chemical structure of some of the plants which have been known for possessing anti-infection properties.” The Pune University had done all the preclinical trials on animals to test the efficacy of the compound. “The toxicity tests have been successfully completed. Plants were screened and only those were selected for imitation and modification of the structure which had properties of anti-infection,” said Keyur Brahmbhatt, a doctorate student at NIPER, who was a part of the study.

With timely intervention and little help from doctors, they can deliver healthy babies, without passing on the virus. Doctors at AIIMS claim that they have successfully helped HIV positive women to deliver 84 children since June 2004, the highest number in all ygovernment hospitals across the country. Of these, 83 children are healthy and free from HIV infection. One baby died due to early infection. Head of the gynaecology department Dr Suneeta Mittal said 61% of these children were delivered through caesarean procedure as it reduces the chances of infection transmission by one-third. The rest were born through normal delivery. ""We screened more than 10,000 pregnant women admitted at AIIMS under `Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission' programme. Of these, 128 women tested positive for the disease. Fifteen percent opted for termination of the pregnancy while others were operated on and given the required drugs,'' Mittal said. Lalit Kumar, a counsellor at AIIMS, said that 75% of the HIV positive mothers treated by the departments were from the cities, including Delhi. ""There were some cases in which the women were found positive for HIV and the male counterpart tested negative. This led to tension in the family and their relationship was on the verge of breaking. But after the birth of the child, the family was happy,'' said Kumar. The treatment included doses of Nevarapin to the mother during delivery, followed by a single dose to the infant within 72 hours of birth. Except for one child who died within hours of birth as he was infected before the mother reached us, all children are safe and have tested negative for HIV, said Dr Mittal. Out of 84 children born, 47 have completed their periodical tests of 18 months and have tested negative for the infection. ""These children can live a healthy life now. We hope good results for other children too,'' said Dr Mittal. She said that breast feeding can also lead to transmission of HIV infection, so most of the mothers have been advised against it. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), every year, more than 7 lakh children become HIV-positive via transmission from their parents across the world. Some 15-20% are infected during pregnancy, 50% during delivery and 33% through breastfeeding. ""Screening of pregnant women for HIV should be mandatory in all hospitals. This can save "
80,11,2010,'Only 3 lakh HIV+ patients have access to life-saving drug',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Only-3-lakh-HIV-patients-have-access-to-life-saving-drug/articleshow/6979246.cms," NEW DELHI: Around 1.2 lakh Indians got infected with HIV last year, even though the incidence rate of new cases has fallen in the country by over 50% in the last decade. At present, India, which has 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria. However, the country's HIV prevalence is still low at .31% — from .36% in 2006. Be that as it may, though seven lakh HIV+ Indians require the life-saving anti-retroviral (ART) drugs, only three lakh have access to the medicine. As far as mother-to-child transmission of HIV is concerned, India recorded 18,000 pediatric HIV births off 65,000 HIV+ mothers. India records 27 million pregnancies a year. These are the latest data from the 2010 AIDS epidemic report — the most comprehensive report on a single disease that was released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. For the first time, experts say the HIV epidemic is on the wane. At least, 56 countries have either stabilised or achieved significant fall in rates of new HIV infections. ""For the first time, we can see the world beginning to truly reverse the AIDS epidemic. Globally, it had peaked in 1999-2000. In Asia, it had peaked in 2003-04. The biggest problem in India is that too many people don't know that they are infected with HIV. Every HIV case is preventable and to have 1.2 lakh new infections in India show that we are not doing enough,"" said Dr Charles Gilks, who heads UNAIDS in India. He added, ""It is vital that India focuses on prevention as cost of treatment will continue to increase."" Not only has new HIV infection rate fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 (3.1 million people had got infected in 1999), but AIDS-related deaths have also come down by nearly 20% in the last five years. In 2009, 1.8 million people died from AIDS-related illnesses, down from 2.1 million in 2004. "
81,11,2010,"Pill lowers HIV infection rate by 44%, shows study",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Pill-lowers-HIV-infection-rate-by-44-shows-study/articleshow/6977483.cms," NEW DELHI: The same drug used for treating HIV can also prevent gay and bi-sexual men from getting infected in the first place. In a landmark study, announced on Tuesday, scientists have found that Truvada -- a single daily pill containing two drugs that is being used by HIV patients -- actually reduces the risk of contracting the virus by at least 44%. In what is being hailed as the biggest success in finding a prevention tool against the deadly HIV, the iPrEx study -- published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) -- found that those, who popped the pill more than 90% of the time, were 73% less susceptible to contract HIV. The study, which involved nearly 2500 high-risk gay men, is significant because it gives credence to an HIV prevention approach called oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves the use of anti-retrovirals (ART) by those who are HIV-negative and at high risk of infection. The findings come only a few months after an African study by the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) showed that a microbicidal gel can help protect women from contracting the virus. ""iPrEx has proved the concept of oral PrEP, and now its up to the field to build on this success and work towards realising the full potential of this promising approach in different at-risk populations, such as injection drug users and women. I am now convinced that there will be a day when we have several safe and effective methods for preventing HIV,"" said Sharon Hillier, professor and director of reproductive infectious disease research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The iPrEx study involved 2,499 participants from Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, the US, South Africa and Thailand who were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: Truvada (a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine) or Placebo. All participants received safe sex counselling and free condoms, and were tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during their monthly visit right through the programme. Of the 1,248 participants assigned to the Placebo group, 64 acquired HIV during the study as compared to 36 of the 1,251 in the Truvada group. ""The findings of this study have immense implications for the entire HIV prevention field, but most notably for global efforts focused on the population of men who have sex with men engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse,"" said MTN investigator Ian McGowan. What about the concerns that people who take PrEP could develop drug resistance if they become infected with HIV? The researchers said, if someone became infected with HIV while using an ARV-based prevention strategy, then the patient's virus would be exposed to whatever ARV drug or drugs are being administered. Consequently, resistance to that drug could emerge. "
82,11,2010,HIV+ numbers in city see negative growth,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/HIV-numbers-in-city-see-negative-growth/articleshow/6991747.cms," MUMBAI: In tune with the global trend, the HIV/AIDS epidemic appears to be slowing down in Mumbai as well. For decades the city was infamous for being the HIV capital of India, but figures available with the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society show that for the third consecutive year the HIV incidence is falling. If 5,420 AIDS cases were registered in 2007, there were only 2,942 cases in 2008 and 1,308 cases in 2009. ""So far this year, we have registered 966 cases,"" said MDACS chief Dr S S Kudalkar, adding that the epidemic is clearly on the wane. The city has many reasons to cheer on the HIV/AIDS front. Many of the indicators that are used to assess the epidemic's spread in the general population show a downward trend. The virus is lower than ever before among pregnant women, dipping from 1.24% in 2005 to 0.53% in the first 10 months of 2010. Public health experts say this unsuspecting segment provides the best indicator of the disease's presence in the general population. People who queue up voluntarily to donate blood provide another indicator of HIV's presence in the society: seropositivity has fallen from 1.06% in 2002 to 0.46% in 2009. In the period up to October 2010, only 903 from 2,19,332 donors tested positive for HIV. ""This means only 0.41% were positive,"" said Kudalkar. But the statistic that the MDACS director is most pleased about is the dipping number of deaths among HIV-positive people whose disease progressed to full-blown AIDS. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, say in 2004, the death rate stood at 8.67% among the 3,205 AIDS patients identified that year. This year, the rate has fallen to 3.7%—that is, 36 deaths among 966 patients. ""It is obvious that with better availability of ART (anti-retro viral therapy), patients are leading healthier and longer lives than before,"" said Kudalkar. The downward trend in Mumbai is not surprising as the recently released United Nations AIDS organization's figures show. Globally, HIV infection rates have fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 from 3.1 million in 1999. Also, AIDS-related deaths have come down by 20% in the same period across the world. UNAIDS showed that India has 2.4 million HIV patients at present. The only factor clouding the happy picture is the fact that though seven lakh HIV-positive Indians need ART, less than half have access to it. In Mumbai, ART access improved only because more centres started distributing the life-saving drugs in the last few years. In Mumbai, MDACS statistics show that 24,086 of 52,828 HIV-positive patients registered for care in the city received ART in the period between 2006 and 2010. "
83,11,2010,MEA lifts all travel curbs against HIV+,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/MEA-lifts-all-travel-curbs-against-HIV/articleshow/6996878.cms," NEW DELHI: Foreigners coming to get a look and feel of ""Incredible India"" won't be required to declare their HIV status while filling their visa forms. India has lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients. In 2002, the Union health ministry had issued a notification, stating that reference to a mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies and consulates failed to enforce it, and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. On September 17, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) sent an email to all its embassies and consulates, clarifying that there are no travel or residency restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) coming to India. MEA has asked all offices to remove the requirement for HIV test from all visa forms available with Indian Embassies and Consulates. The action was prompted by a parliamentary question on April 15 by Dr E M Sudarsana Natchiappan, MP and a member of the Forum of Parliamentarians on HIV and AIDS (FPA). Welcoming the initiative, Oscar Fernandes, MP and president of FPA, said, ""I am pleased that India has clarified its position to lift HIV-related travel restrictions."" J D Seelam, MP and general secretary FPA, said, ""We welcome the step taken by MEA as globally there are ambiguities about India's standing on travel regulations based on HIV status."" Dr Natchiappan added, ""We commend the leadership displayed by the Indian government. FPA believes that these types of travel restrictions limit the rights of people living with HIV and fuel discrimination and stigma."" Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive. Stigmatising HIV-positive individuals is contrary to effective public health programming. Official data shows that 66 countries deny entry, stay or residence to HIV-positive individuals -- of these nations, 26 deport migrants who test positive, seven refuse permission to stay beyond a certain time bar and six deny entry even for very short-term stay. ""These restrictions are in blatant violation of human rights, they stimulate stigma and discrimination and actually hurt the response to the HIV epidemic,"" said Kevin Moody, International Coordinator and CEO, Global Network of People Living with HIV. Union health secretary K Sujatha Rao believes that irrational discriminatory laws should be lifted. ""In India, we don't have any laws against residence or visit by HIV patient,"" she pointed out. Dr Charles Gilks, UNAIDS country coordinator, said such regulations were issued by many countries in the 1980s when little was known about HIV, and there was more of confusion and fear about the virus. Globally, there is no evidence that such restrictions prevent HIV transmission or protect public health. MEA's move upholds India's commitment to human rights and dignity of all people including those living with HIV. A WHO statement pointed out that such entry restrictions actually pressurise people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. ""They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" said the statement. The US, China and Namibia recently lifted their decades-old travel laws against HIV-positive patients. "

It said when it is a matter of life or death, there can be no discrimination in treatment. In an affidavit before the SC, National AIDS Control Authority (NACO) said second line ART for HIV patients could not be extended to those who had received ""irrational treatment"" by private medical practitioners. It said such persons were either switched to second line treatment at an early stage or were put directly on second line drugs without undergoing the preliminary treatment, thus making them hard cases. NACO's attempt to broadbase its second line treatment by excluding those who had little hope of surviving for long was, prima facie, unpalatable to a Bench of Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar, which was hearing a PIL filed by NGO Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust. ""We cannot go by this discrimination. Right to life is a constitutional right,"" it said. Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam explained that world over, it was a common practice that there had to be a rationale for HIV patients for their upgradation from first line to second line treatment. He supplemented NACO's affidavit, which said, ""Irrational treatment prescribed by private medical practitioners where persons are switched to second line treatment without any evidence of treatment failure to first line ART leads to early drug resistance and consequent risk of transmission of resistant virus."" NACO said about 70 hospitals had informed it that there were 24,212 persons on ART, of which 1,074 were put on second line treatment due to toxicity of first line drugs and another 2,173 because of treatment failure. With the PIL claiming that over 15,000 patients were currently receiving second line treatment from private clinics/practitioners, the Bench said, ""How can a person be punished if he is incorrectly treated upon by a private practitioner. Under Article 21, whether this argument can stand has to be seen. People are going to die and this cannot happen."" The anguish of the court forced the government to seek 10 days time to do a rethink. The Centre agreed to call for details from all private hospitals and clinics and file a fresh affidavit. "

""Singh's story is a celebration of life,"" said Kumar. ""We were awarded money when this film won a national award, but none of the people who helped me make the film asked for anything. It was given to Singh for the expensive proteins and supplements he requires to stay fit and build his body."" The second film that promotes HIV awareness in the Indian Panorama section is 'Going the distance', a digital film that revolves around a HIV+ woman's attempt to go ahead in life. Speaking about HIV and Aids in the North East, Kumar said, ""It is a big problem with drugs coming from Burma. In the past, most cases were transmitted through infected syringes. Now most are through sexual transmission and mother to child."" "
86,11,2010,There are 60 HIV+ kids in Varanasi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/There-are-60-HIV-kids-in-Varanasi/articleshow/7006403.cms," VARANASI: It is not easy for a seven-year-old child living with HIV/AIDS or even his/her parents to talk about the miseries of life before the civil society. But, on the eve of the World AIDS Day, many children living with HIV/AIDS and their parents assembled in the city on Sunday and shared their life experiences and problems, like the discrimination and humiliation they faced in the society. Though there is a programme and facilities to control HIV/AIDS, most of them felt themselves excluded from the society. It was an initiative of the Uttar Pradesh Welfare for People Living with HIV/AIDS (UPNP+) with the support of UNICEF and Media Nest to give a voice to such persons and create awareness among people. Around 15 children from different districts including Varanasi, Chandauli, Jaunpur, Mirzapur and Bhadohi attended the programme. ""In Varanasi, there are 60 children of 5-14 age group who are infected with HIV,"" president of Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (BNP+) Manoj Kumar Singh informed TOI. According to him, the number of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) in the eastern UP is over 500. The Varanasi district has over 1,000 persons infected with HIV, and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP. The UNICEF report estimates that 70,000 children below the age of 15 are living with HIV in India and 21,000 children are infected every year through parent-to-child transmission. According to the 2009-10 annual report of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), demographically the second largest country in the world, India has also the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS. As per the provisional HIV estimate of 2008-09, there are an estimated 22.7 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in India. The HIV prevalence rate in the country is 0.29 per cent (2008-09) and most infections occur through heterosexual route of transmission. However, there are now 33.4 million people living with HIV, according to 2008 figures released by WHO. An estimated 2.7 million were newly infected with the virus and 2 million died of AIDS the same year. To take up the issue World AIDS Day is observed on December 1 to draw together people from around the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. In Varanasi, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. According to the records, so far over 11,000 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU. Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It mentors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. According Kulsum Talha of Media Nest, the children living with HIV should be heard and given due importance to fill them with a sense of respect. They should be encouraged to become a useful component of the society. The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) III 2007-2012 has the overall goal of halting and reversing the epidemic in India. The NACP III places highest priority on prevention while seeking to integrate care, support and treatment for those affected by HIV/ AIDS. "

While the number of people who accessed the state-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) rose from 93,650 in 2008 to 11,53,810 in 2010, the rate of HIV prevalence showed a decline from 16.42% in 2002 to 4.72% in 2010, said Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), on Monday. ""The MSACS has been focusing on strengthening the services and improving its access, especially for the people with high risk behaviours, through targeted interventions across the state,"" Deshmukh said. ""The prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT) programme, which ensures that every pregnant woman gets screened for HIV and gets medical care has shown remarkable success,"" Deshmukh said. ""In 2002, the HIV prevalence amongst pregnant women was 3.15%. This has been brought down to 0.35%. This year, as many as 8,51,673 women got tested under the PPTCT programme against 21,047 in 2002. For the women in sex work, this rate was contained at 7.4%, a decline of almost 35% from the prevalence of 42.8% in 2004. The MSACS, which runs a comprehensive HIV prevention care, support and treatment programme throughout the state, is implementing the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme, which calls for decentralisation and subsequent strengthening of services at the district level. This year three anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres, three second line ART centres and 10 link ART centres have been opened at the district levels, Deshmukh said. ""This has resulted in massive scaling up of the programme with an assurance that even the remote areas get covered."" ""Maharashtra remains a primary destination for migrants due to the huge demand for manpower in various sectors, which include unskilled labourers and construction and industrial workers,"" Deshmukh said. ""Risk perceptions among this population are low due to illiteracy and lack of knowledge about HIV. Considering the significance of this issue, the MSACS is launching a state-level communication campaign for migrants from December 2010 to March 2011, covering around 20 districts where migrant population are high. This will ensure that the HIV prevention messages reach out to each and every migrant and he/she is motivated to access the available services,"" he added. "

But her dreams were shattered after she was abandoned by her husband to marry other woman. Her parents refused to support her, while she managed to stay in a small house in a village with her two children. Making the matter worse, a ""close friend"", on the pretext of helping her, pushed her into flesh trade. That's the turn of events in the life of Girija B (name changed) of Kusugal village near here.

But her determination to prevent other sex workers and innocent people from getting inflicted with the dreaded disease made her to pledge the rest of her life to create awareness on AIDS among the needy. Now, Girija is working full time to reform sex workers and educate people about AIDS. She has reached out to more people after she was picked up by Society for People's Action for Development (SPAD, Hubli). Her active involvement in counselling, educating and creating awareness about AIDS has made her a role model and popular among HIV-positives network in the city. Girija does not only counsel or educate, but also takes care of abandoned HIV-infected women besides helping them get treatment at hospitals. She also keeps tab on each HIV people so they take medicines regularly. Girija also volunteers to conduct the last rites of abandoned HIV patients who die in hospitals.

Though the prevalence rate of 0.75% is higher than the national average of 0.69%, it is still lower compared to the rate of the state, which is at 0.86%. Dr Kishore Kumar, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) officer told `The Times of India' that the general cases recorded since 2007 have seen a decline this year till October. While 1,245 positive cases were detected in 2007, this year there have been only 815 till October end. The cases are recorded for 12 months starting January. Of the 815 cases, as many as 297 are from outside the district. The taluk-wise break up of the cases is as follows: While Mangalore recorded the highest at 298, the least was in Sullia at 22, followed by Bantwal (82), Belthangady (62) and Puttur at 55. Of these, 528 cases are male and 287 are women. Dr Kishore said the prevalence as usual was the highest among the sexually-active in the age group of 16 to 45 at 656. There 12 children with HIV below the age of five and 24 in the group of five to 15 years. The DAPCU officer said 90% of the transmission cases were by the sexual route. Among pregnant women, 41 HIV cases have been recorded till date this year. In this case also, the figures have seen a decline since 2007 from 82, despite the number of patients tested was 19,421 as compared to 14,764 cases tested in 2007. Dr Kishore said the nevirapine (drug used to treat HIV infection) regimen with pregnant women had seen mother-to-child transmission cases come down drastically. ""Of the 72 deliveries, we have had only two positive cases,"" he said. Nevirapine is administered both to mother and child (within 72 hours) at the time of delivery. The child is tested with DNA PCR for infection at six weeks and whatever the result, the anti-body test is done after 18 months for confirmation. stanly.pinto@timesgroup.com "
90,11,2010,HIV+ persons deserve a dignified life,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/HIV-persons-deserve-a-dignified-life/articleshow/7018407.cms," ALLAHABAD: The rising number of AIDS cases raise a serious concern in the society. With no treatment available for it, prevention is the only way to control AIDS cases. Add to this social stigma, ostracism and multiple legal issues, AIDS gets more complex, specially in countries like India. HIV the etiological agent of AIDS belongs to the Lentivirus subgroup of the family retroviridae. It is a challenging issue across the world. The virus is present in blood, tissue and all body fluid of infected persons. HIV is spread by sexual contact with infected persons (heterosexual or homosexual), by blood and blood products, and from infected mother to babies. About 85% AIDS cases are due to sexual contact 3.80%, 2.05%, 3.34% and 6.46% due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injecting durg users and others respectively. The World AIDS Day is being observed since December 1, 1988, and aims at raising money, increasing awareness, fighting prejudice and improving education. The theme for this year is ""Universal access and human rights"". World AIDS Day reminds people that HIV still exists and a lot still needs to be done. Head, department of forensic medicine, MLN Medical College, Dr US Sinha says, ""In a study conducted by our department in 2009-10 shows that 75% men and 25% women came for HIV tests here. Out of these, 18.6% men and 12% women were found HIV positive. The maximum HIV+ cases were in the age group of 25-34 years. As far as distribution of persons suffering from psychosomatic disorder is concerned, over 94% people express shock, stigmatisation (76%), discrimination (70%), family violence (47%), social violence (31%), family rejection (41%), social rejection (64%), depression (88%), loneliness (76%), fear (100%) and suicidal tendency (58%). Dr Sinha says as the incidence and public awareness of required immunodeficiency syndrome increases, the ethical, legal and regulatory mechanism too are becoming significant. In August 1989, the AIDS Prevention Bill was moved in Parliament. The section 4 of the bill mandates every registered physician to report each case of HIV positive patient to health authorities, but does not provide a confidentially clause. Section 7 of the Bill however, requires health authorities to undertake counselling, health education and specialised treatment. But this is of no avail if confidentiality is not guaranteed. Section 5 talks of precautionary measures to curb the spread of infection. As far as law and regulations governing HIV infected persons is concerned, Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees right to life and personal liberty to every HIV positive person. Besides, it's the fundamental right of every AIDS patient to have access to proper treatment. An HIV infected person also has the right to privacy. The right to privacy of a person has been stated in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Right, Article 17 of the international covenant on civil and political rights and Article 21 of the Constitution. Moreover, Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution guarantee equality and provide against discrimination in employment respectively. Article 16 prohibits discrimination in public employment on grounds of religion, caste, creed, sex, colour etc. "

At daybreak, people begin to crowd around in the bustling marketplace to buy idlis and dosas from a woman who is HIV positive. Vijayarani's customers are aware of her condition, but have no problem patronising her. Vijayarani and her co-worker Sumathy, 40, who is also HIV positive, run the shop together, earning up to Rs 500 per day. On the eve of World AIDS day, the duo serve as yet another reminder of the manner in which the stigma attached to the disease can be overcome even in a socially backward town like Usilampatti. It was only three years ago that Vijayarani's world fell apart. She and her six-year-old son were diagnosed as HIV-positive. But when her husband, Elango, tested negative, he began taunting his wife and finally told her that he was leaving her for good. Vijayarani had contracted the disease from her first husband, who had died a few years earlier. ""Initially, I was devastated. I didn't know what to do. Then, I heard about the Vaigai network of people living with HIV/AIDS,"" she said. These women do not hide the fact that they are carriers of the deadly virus, but say that the society around them has come to accept them. ""People have come to realise that mere physical contact with a HIV-positive person does not spread the disease,"" she pointed out. Frail and thin, Vijayarani started out on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) soon after the diagnosis, and alongside struggled to achieve financial independence. ""I look as healthy as any woman in our village and we have a successful business. Isn't that proof enough?"" she said in between ladling sambar for her customers. Vijayarani admitted her son in school after informing the authorities of his condition. Now the nine-year-old is a student in the fifth standard who comes within the top ten ranks in the class. T Rajapandian, a local, who frequents the shop, vouches for Vijayarani. ""There is nothing to beat her two-rupee idlis and dosas and the tasty accompaniments. I also take parcels home for my children at nights,"" he said. P Annathai, who had been instrumental in spreading awareness about the shop, said, ""I told my family and friends that we should help them and not shun them."" Dr E S Thangapandian, programme manager of the government-run district AIDS Prevention and Control Unit said, ""Theirs is an example for many to follow"". "

As of now, women under the Prevention of Parent-To-Child Transmission of HIV programme are given a single dose of Nevirapine at the time of labour and to the newborn after the delivery. Now, Naco has decided that if the pregnant HIV woman is found to have blood CD4 count below 350, she will be put on a full-fledged anti retroviral therapy. However, if the woman’s blood CD4 count is above 350, she will be put on a more effective drug, Zidovudine, right from 16 weeks of pregnancy till the delivery. However, the new-born will be administered Nevirapine throughout the breast- feeding period. "

With studies confirming that India’s transgender community is at highest risk of contracting the deadly HIV, Naco has rolled out stand-alone targeted interventions (TI) meant exclusively for them. As of now, interventions for this community are clubbed with those meant for MSMs. Only a single TI in Mumbai addressed the needs of transgenders, counselling them about risky sexual behaviour and treating them for HIV if found already infected. Speaking to TOI, officials at Naco confirmed that there are two and three intervention sites for transgenders in Mumbai and Chennai, respectively. Dr Charles Gilks, UNAIDS India head, had recently said, “Transgenders are the smallest group having the largest risk of HIV.” The 2010 UNAIDS report on the global AIDS epidemic found that among the high risk group that got HIV infection in India last year — 9.2% were intravenous drug users, MSMs (7.3%) and female sex workers (4.9%). In comparison, a study conducted 250 transgenders in the Mumbai site found HIV prevalence to be as high as 16% among them, NACO officials said. They added, “Besides their biological disposition to contracting the disease, they are also those who are involved in very high risk behavior. Some have even been involved in commercial sex activities. TIs are now being planned and put in place solely for this community.” India doesn’t have any credible data of its transgender population. NACO estimates that India is home to 3.5 lakh MSMs involved in high risk behaviour. "

Yerawada Central Jail in Pune has 120 HIV infected inmates, the highest in the state. ""A total 21,404 prisoners in Maharashtra's prisons were screened in the last two years. Of them, 4,472 inmates were from Yerawada Central Jail. Among them, 120 were detected with HIV infection which is the highest in the state,"" said Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) told TOI on Monday Of the 467 HIV infected prisoners, 87 have been put on antiretroviral treatment as their CD4 count is less than 250, said Deshmukh. CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. HIV attacks these cells and uses them to spread the virus which weakens the immune system. People without HIV infection have about 700 to 1000 CD4 cells in a drop of blood. HIV infected people are considered to have normal CD4 counts if the number is above 500 CD4 cells in on blood drop. Health experts say that prisoners can be HIV infected if they participate in unprotected sex or share infected needles while using illicit drugs. They also maintained that the HIV infection rate among prisoners was lower than the general populace that came for testing to integrated counselling and treatment centres at hospitals. ""The prevalence rate comes to 2.18 per cent of the total number of prisoners which is below the 4.7 per cent incidence rate in the general population coming to ICTCs for testing,"" said Deshmukh. ""The presence of HIV infected persons and those at high risk in prisons is a critical challenge. Unlike the general population, many prisoners may not be aware if they are infected with HIV. Often, vastly crowded living conditions lead to such behaviour among prisoners,"" said A L Kakrani, professor and head department of medicine D Y Patil Medical College. He is also an ex-member of the technical resource group of the Government of India on ART. ""The tedious prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to the high-risk activities such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men,"" Kakrani said. The history of five HIV infected inmates at Yerawada jail has revealed that they were MSM (men having sex with men), said Sudhakar Ingale, counsellor of the ICTC centre at the jail. ""We are spreading awareness about the risks associated with MSM among the prisoners,"" he said. A recent UNAIDS report says that the HIV epidemic in Asia was concentrated largely among people who inject drugs, sex workers (FSW) and their clients, and MSMs. About 90 per cent of those newly infected with HIV in India were believed to have acquired it during unprotected sex. The ICTC facilities The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) facilities were started at Yerawada and Amravati jails by the MSACS as a pilot project on October 2, 2008 . The move came following a directive by the Bombay High Court. The ICTC facilities with full-time counsellors and technicians have been started at five more jails including Nashik, Taloja, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Nagpur. The other jails in the state send the inmates for testing and counselling to government hospitals that have ICTC facilities. ""There are no plans to set up full-fledged ICTCs in all the prisons in the state. Earlier, a proposal was sent to the National AIDS Control Society of India (NACO), but they are ready to extend only training if the state government recruits workforce,"" said Deshmukh. An integrated counselling and testing centre is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The main functions of an ICTC include counselling and testing for HIV, creating awareness on modes of transmission, prevention of HIV/AIDS for promoting behavioural change and reducing vulnerability.

Nearly, 61,000 people are living with HIV and AIDS in Punjab as compared to 17,000 in 2007. According to mapping estimates of 2009, there are around 23,000 IDUs in the state with HIV prevalence of 26.1%. The national prevalence is 9%. ""There has been a four-fold rise in people suffering from HIV in Punjab because earlier we did not include the high-risk group,"" said Punjab AIDS Control Society additional director NM Sharma. With the state having nearly three times higher number of drug abusers using injections, the problem of HIV has only become more acute. ""The number is more than this and a survey is in progress to fathom the real problem,"" said Sharma. ""We don’t know the number of HIV infected people. All we know is that we were detecting 4,000 people with HIV every year and the number has gone up to 5,000 per annum,"" he added. Adult HIV prevalence among males is 0.37% and in females, it is 0.26%. Chawla said, ""We have started five Opioid Substitution Therapy Centres in Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Batala, Jalandhar and Ludhiana as part of the harm reduction services. The services will be expanded in time to come in other districts as per the programme requirement."" What has become a cause for concern is the failure of health authorities to reach out to all those suffering from HIV and providing them adequate medical care. About 16,110 were registered in HIV Care till October 2010, but only half, about 8,890, were put on anti-retro viral therapy (ART) in the state. The numbers of those on medicine have only dwindled — with just 6,045 currently on ART in the state. So far, 1,325 people in the state have died of AIDS. The number is likely to go up considering the phenomenal growth of drug abusers sharing needles. "

While passing the orders, the bench has relied on the opinion of the medical board that conducted the medical examination of the personnel. A division bench comprising judicial member Justice Ghanshyam Prasad and administrative member Lt Gen NS Brar passed the order while rejecting a petition by Havildar Raj Kumar, who joined the Army in September 1985 and was discharged on August 27, 2002, on medical grounds — of HIV infection with disseminated tuberculosis (TB). In order to get disability pension in addition to the service pension, Kumar contended that since he was fit when he joined the Army and that HIV infection was attributable to military service. He also argued that he got the virus after suffering from TB. “Since TB was attributable to military service, HIV should also be considered in the same light, hence I am entitled for disability pension ” he pleaded. Contesting the plea, the Union government counsel Captain Sandeep Bansal submitted that as per the medical board, the petitioner was admitted in the military hospital on November 17, 2001. "

On board the flight of fancy' were 42 wide-eyed very special children who live with HIV. Their eyes sparkled and their innocent faces lit up with excitement as the Jet Airways flight from Kolkata took off for Bagdogra. On World AIDS Day, these children got a very special gift wings to fly. ""Oi dhekho, meghta koto neeche. Amra to tar upore urchhi,"" (Look, the cloud is down below. We are flying high above), exclaimed Rishav Debnath, looking out of the window. The six-year-old was abandoned by relatives after his mother succumbed to HIV/AIDS. His father too is HIV-positive and is a daily wage earner in Bongaon. Rishav was rescued by Organisation For Friends Energy &amp; Resources (OFFER) and kept in Anandaghar, a home for the HIV-positive children run by the NGO. The 42 HIV-positive children, all inmates of Anandaghar, were granted their wish to fly on World AIDS Day, under the project Gift Me The Sky' organised jointly by OFFER and Bajoria Charitable Foundation (BCF). They clapped in excitement as the aircraft took off from the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport. ""I have never seen an aeroplane except in photographs. I never knew it is so big and has so many seats,"" exclaimed four-year-old Tina, sitting by the window. Tina's mother was trafficked as a young girl and forced into prostitution. She lost her mental balance when she discovered she was HIV-positive and is lodged in a hospice in Kolkata. Tina was left with no one to look after as no one knows who her father is. ""Tina was brought to Anandaghar when she was just about five months old. Most of these children are orphans who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS and their relatives threw them out because of their HIV status,"" said OFFER founder secretary Kallol Ghosh. From Bagdogra, the children will proceed to Mirik for a dream vacation in the Hills. They were told about the tour plans only a few days ago. And the excitement began soon after. ""Many of us could not even sleep properly last night due to excitement. We kept discussing how it would be like flying up in the air,"" said Samir. The 11-year-old was adopted by Anandaghar in 2007 after the boy lost his parents to AIDS. After his father's death, Samir and his mother were made to live in a cow-shed in their Bongaon house when relatives came to know about their HIV status. In a year's time Samir lost his mother too. ""Can you see the smile of their faces? There could be no better gift for them on this day,"" said Namit Bajoria, managing trustee (BCF).

99,12,2010,HIV couple who met at matrimonial meet ties knot,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/HIV-couple-who-met-at-matrimonial-meet-ties-knot/articleshow/7026071.cms," PUNE: It was at a matrimonial meet for the HIV-positive in Pune on August 1, that 36-year-old Santosh S and 34-year-old Geetanjali P decided to marry each other. They tied the nuptials in the presence of close family and friends in the city on Wednesday, that was World AIDS Day. The couple’s happiness was evident. “Now I have a company. I have somebody to look after and be looked after by. No one can give you better support than your wife,” said Santosh, who works as a security guard. A few years ago, he lost his first wife to HIV, and he had to hand over his 10-year-old daughter to her grandparents in Mumbai. Geetanjali, a widow, who had to face prejudice in the household once her in-laws found out about her condition in 2002, chose to settled down despite her circumstances. “I have been independent right from the beginning. I have been earning my own money and have never depended on my parents or siblings for anything. But it was my mother’s unwavering support that helped me take the decision to settle down once again. I want to remain self-reliant, come what may,” said Geetanjali, who works at a tuberculosis centre in Hadapsar. Her 11-year-old son, from her previous marriage, will live with the couple. “We have decided not to have children. My wife and I are going to take care of each other, follow a disciplined lifestyle and lend each other as much moral and emotional support possible,” said Santosh. Disha, an initiative by Deep Griha Society to help HIV-positive people, was instrumental in organising the matrimonial meet in August. Santosh and Geetanjali also sought pre-marital counselling with Disha. “That day, some 12 couples announced their plans to marry. Santosh and Geetanjali are one of the first to get married. For the last few months, they were being counselled on treatment, medication and healthy living,” said Avinash Chakranarayan, coordinator of Disha. The couple wants to pass on a positive message to people living with HIV. “There is nothing wrong with this condition. Consider yourself as normal and healthy and continue living whole-heartedly. Young HIV-positive people should certainly consider getting married. It’s your positive attitude that will make all the difference,” said Geentajali. Names changed to protect identities. "
100,12,2010,EG officials to adopt HIV-affected,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/EG-officials-to-adopt-HIV-affected/articleshow/7031797.cms," KAKINADA: The officials of East Godavari district have decided to adopt HIV-affected children. The district has nearly 10,000 HIV/Aids-affected children. Members of the district officers' association have come forward to adopt one child each. The association has 60 officials in the district. The officials would take care of the children by providing nutritious food, clothes, education, medicine and other needs, member of the association V Ramanjaneyulu said. He said every citizen should strive to rescue the HIV/AIDS affected children. Collector Ravichandra said Antyodaya Anna Yojana cards would be distributed to 3,613 victims in the district soon and they would be supplied 35 kilos of rice every month. He said that at present only 305 victims had got the cards. East Godavari is one of the 10 selected districts in the state for implementing the `Children affected by Aids (CABA)' programme. Under this project, AIDS-hit children would get nutritious food, supplied by Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS). District additional medical health officer and Aids nodal officer M Pawan Kumar said 57,731 people were suffering from HIV/Aids in the district. He said efforts were on to reduce the HIV positive cases. "
101,12,2010,Corruption threatens to cripple state's war on HIV,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Corruption-threatens-to-cripple-states-war-on-HIV/articleshow/7030715.cms," MUMBAI: While the state is working hard to contain HIV/AIDS, it seems to have failed to immunize its medical programme against corruption and mismanagement of funds. At least three high-level inquiries are currently underway, in addition to several undercover operations to nab corrupt medical officers. The Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) is probing charges of bribery against a medical officer at Thane civic hospital. The officer had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 5,000 from the patient to write a prescription for free anti-retroviral drugs. The role of the centre's counsellor is also suspect in the episode. Another inquiry is on against a medical officer who allegedly demanded money to refer a patient for second line HIV/AIDS treatment. There have also been verbal complaints about medical officers demanding bribes to conduct CD4 tests, which are free of cost. Project director of MSACS, Dr Ramesh Devkar, said that urgent steps were being taken to curb corruption at ART centres across the state. ""In about a fortnight, we will crackdown on all corrupt officers,"" he said. ""We are very discreet about our plan of action as we do not want to alert any of the wrongdoers,"" he added. Devkar said Pune, Aurangabad and Solapur have emerged as the most notorious districts for corruption. The state-run JJ Hospital has to cater to a high number of HIV patients due to the apathy of officials posted at ART centres. A Sawant (32), a resident of Nagpur, was forced to come to JJ after the medical officer refused to change his medication, despite the fact that he had suffered strong drug reactions. ""Once I reached the hospital 10 minutes late. The medical officer threw the file on my face and refused to examine me,"" he said. ""The patients are made to feel guilty for having contracted the virus,"" he said. Another patient from Solapur had developed lymph nodes and required immediate medical attention. ""But, the medical officer there referred the patient all the way to Mumbai without giving any medication for temporary relief,"" said head of ART Centre of JJ hospital Dr Alaka Deshpande. ""It calls for supervision of all ART centres,"" she said. Clinical psychologist at JJ Hospital' s ART centre, Vaishali Shelar, said that they have started insisting that patients submit written complaints against errant doctors or counselors. These complaints are then forwarded to the state agency or Mumbai District Aids Control Society. "
102,12,2010,Low awareness of drug-associated HIV transmission among children of sex workers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Low-awareness-of-drug-associated-HIV-transmission-among-children-of-sex-workers/articleshow/7050105.cms," PUNE: A study undertaken by the D Y Patil Medical College, Pimpri, has found that the children of sex workers are relatively well informed about HIV, causing decreased immunity and its spread through unsafe sex. However, the study underlines the fact that the children have very little awareness about the transmission of HIV through other routes like infected syringes, needles etc. This, researchers say, is an important gray area that needs to be addressed. ""The environment in which the children of sex workers live exposes them to drug pushers, drug peddlers and the sharing of needles for injecting drugs. These are potential risk factors for the transmission of HIV infection. The study assumes significance as the thrust has always been only on creating awareness on avoiding transmission through unprotected sex,"" said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, professor and head of the department of paediatrics at the D Y Patil Medical College under whose guidance the study was carried out. The study, undertaken by paediatrician Sampada Tambolkar and Aishani Shah, a third-year MBBS student was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It was carried out between June and September last year and published in the Australian Medical Journal in June 2010. ""The objective of the study was to assess knowledge, attitude and practices of adolescent students of commercial sex workers in relation to HIV/AIDS and give recommendations about important issues identified during the study,"" said Tambolkar. Adolescent children in the age group of 10 to 15 years were selected for the study. They were given a pre-standardised questionnaire in which they had to answer the questions. Their anonymity was assured. The questionnaire was translated into Marathi by experts, for students. ""There were 36 girls and 14 boys who took part in the study. It was a descriptive study and there were no comparisons. The main point that emerged was the lack of knowledge about the spread of HIV and the means of acquiring the infection,"" said Shah. ""The social status of commercial sex workers widely affects their children. These children are exposed to the problems from a very young age and it is important to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS among them,"" said Tambolkar . ""The particular adolescent age group was chosen because they are largely exposed to unsafe sex and also to other potentially dangerous objects of transmitting infection like infected syringes, needles etc."" Sharing other important findings, she said, ""The general awareness on the physical aspects of growing up among them was good. However, awareness about menstrual issues was poor though most of the participants in the study were females."" ""The knowledge of ante-natal care (medical care of women during pregnancy) and its benefits were not adequately known. Awareness about teenage pregnancy and its hazards was good. They were relatively well informed about HIV causing decreased immunity and its spread by unsafe sex but they were ignorant about its spread by infected syringes, needles etc. This is important as these children may be exposed to such things due to the environment in which they live,"" said Shah. The researchers found that the attitude towards females was not very encouraging. ""A majority of the children thought that major decisions in the family need to be taken by the male members. Only 14% felt that it was incorrect to proceed with antenatal sex detection and most felt that trying cigarette once would not lead to addiction,"" said Tambolkar. "

While the meeting between gay prince of Rajpipla Manvendra Singh Gohil and French first lady Carla Bruni could not materialise due to the latter's arrival in Mumbai getting delayed, functionaries from the fund met Gohil and discussed several issues. Gohil said Bruni got delayed in Delhi and had a packed schedule forcing her to skip the meeting. He added that the officials from the global fund, however, showed keen interest on the work being done on HIV-AIDS prevention in India. ""They were particularly surprised at the manner in which we were functioning in Gujarat. They found this quite in contrast with their experience in Delhi. They found that the people here were more accommodative than that in North India,"" Gohil said. Gohil said he had invited the global fund representatives to visit Gujarat. ""This would give them a better understanding of our work. They said that they were open to the idea and would consider it in the future,"" he said. Gohil added that he would be sending them a series of data and reports so that concrete plans can be worked out. "
104,12,2010,"HIV stats fudged, claims NGO",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/HIV-stats-fudged-claims-NGO/articleshow/7073822.cms," KOLKATA: More than 3,000 HIV-infected children including scores in Kolkata could be going untreated and uncared for in West Bengal, risking transmission of the deadly virus, with the state health authorities not even being aware of their existence. Around 150 of Kolkata's 11,000 streetchildren are infected with AIDS but have never been treated or screened, showed a recent study conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases. Aged less than 14, the majority of them who have acquired the disease from their mothers could die before they turn 18 or even earlier. The alarming facts have been disclosed following the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society's (WBSAPCS) response to an RTI application. The body has put the number of HIV+ children in the state at 684, including just 50 in Kolkata. Prantakatha, the NGO which filed the RTI application, has pointed out that more than 200 infected children have been traced in Kolkata alone. While the WBSAPCS claimed that their data has been compiled through various local networks and social organizations working at the grassroots with HIV+ people, Prantakatha alleged that the figure had been cooked up. ""They have no data on HIV-infected children. Even their website is silent on the number of paediatric HIV+ patients even though it declares the number of infected men, women and youth in the state. We had filed an RTI in August seeking information on the district-wise distribution of HIV positive children. After staying mum for months, they sent us a break-up of the number of patients across the districts on December 3. It said 684 was the total number. Kolkata, if they are to be believed, has just 50 HIV-infected children,"" said Bappaditya Mukherjee, secretary of Prantakatha. The WBSAPCS, however, claimed the data was authentic. ""We have collected the figures after a thorough interaction with local networks and scanning their information base. A large percentage of the HIV-infected children in Kolkata actually hail from the districts and they have been included in our list. But it's true that there's no government home for HIV children,"" said Swarnadipa Biswas, deputy director of WBSAPCS. Ananda Ghar, the only home for HIV+ children in the state has 42 inmates. Privately run by an NGO at Gobindopur in South 24-Parganas, it claimed that hundreds of infected youngsters from Kolkata and its outskirts were eager to join the home. ""At least, 150 children are waiting and we have regular contacts with them. Most are either orphans or social outcasts. This proves that the WBSAPCS data is fabricated. They have neither done a survey nor have any programme to care for these children,"" said Kallol Ghosh of OFFER, the NGO which runs the home. What could be even more dangerous is the threat they pose in terms of transmission, many pointed out. ""Few of the kids are aware of their status and have no access to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). Since a high percentage of them are drug-users, they could well be transmitting the disease,"" said Tarit Chakraborty, secretary of BNP Plus a network of HIV-positive people. Less than 25% of the children now receive ART, said an official at the ART centre in Calcutta Medical College Hospital. ""There has never been any study or survey. But information from private bodies working across the state, shows the total number of infected children could be more than 3000,"" said the official. "

In the first phase, the insurance scheme, with public and private participation, will cover around 750 people in the district and the insurance company will meet the cost of treatment upto Rs 15,000 per year for each patient. There are 15,675 people who have been tested HIV + in the district. Bellary was once in second place as the state having the highest number of AIDS-infected patients but the number has since dropped to eighth place due to the awareness and precautionary measures taken by the district administration. Deputy commissioner B Shivappa said details about the insurance scheme has been chalked out with the private insurance company and that soon the facility would be provided for the welfare of HIV patients. There has been a decline in HIV infection among youth below the age of 25 in the district due to prevention, care and support services which have increased through non-governmental organizations such as MYRADA, Vimukthi, Nityajeevana, Population Services International and Work Vision.

He was rushed to a private hospital in Hyderabad in a critical condition. Sources said the accused resorted to the extreme action after it was diagnosed that he is HIV-positive. Local ward member Linga Swamy reportedly administered poison-laced cold drink to wife Jayaprada, 27, daughter Ramya, 12 and son Sachin, 10. When they lost consciousness, he allegedly hanged them from the ceiling in the house with a plastic rope. Later, he tried to hang himself with the same rope but the rope snapped and he fell down hurting his head. He suffered a bleeding injury. Swamy's sister, who stays with them, raised an alarm after seeing his injured brother and alerted the neighbours who rushed him to the hospital. Locals said Swamy was having disputes with Jayaprada and the couple quarrelled on Friday night. But Choutuppal CI Tirupathanna said as per preliminary investigation, Swamy was upset ever since he was found HIV-positive. ""He might have taken his frustration on his wife and children and later tried to end his life. He doesn't have any financial and family disputes,"" a police official said. A case has been registered and the bodies sent to the hospital for an autopsy. "

Delhi high court on Monday directed Delhi government to reserve at least one bed each in all its hospitals, which have dialysis facilities for HIV patients. Delhi government had told the court that it was reserving one bed each in two of its hospitals for HIV patients. While accepting the NCT government’s decision to reserve one bed each for HIV patients in Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur Hospitals, the court, however, expressed the arrangement was inadequate and the government was required to reserve at least one bed each in its other hospitals in a time-bound manner. ‘‘Given the scale of the problem faced by the HIV positive patients in obtaining maintenance dialysis in government hospitals, this court is of the view that it is inadequate to reserve just one bed each in two hospitals of Government of NCT, Delhi. In a time-bound manner, at least one bed must be reserved in each of the other hospitals functioning under Government of NCT, Delhi, which are otherwise providing dialysis facilities,’’ said Justice S Muralidhar in an order. Seeking an affidavit within eight weeks from Delhi government’s department of health and family welfare, the court asked the Delhi government to inform the court the time and schedule within which one bed each can be reserved in other government hospitals under them. The court’s direction came after an affidavit filed by the Union health ministry through its counsel Jatan Singh said the Centre has taken a decision to provide dialysis facilities to each of the hospitals under Delhi government. The court was hearing a petition filed by a HIV-positive patient seeking a direction to AIIMS and other government hospitals which failed to provide him dialysis. Earlier, the court had directed the central government to draw a plan along with Delhi government to increase the number of hospitals offering dialysis to HIV-positive patients. "

The Centre had serious reservations in taking on HIV positive persons who had been irrationally treated by private hospitals for second-line treatment but it bowed to the SC’s argument that the government could not discriminate in extending medical facilities when the core question was right to life. Senior advocate T S Doabia, appearing for the health ministry, informed a Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar that National AIDS Control Organisation has decided to extend second-line ART to all HIV positive patients at four centres of excellence in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. “This facility will gradually extended to all 10 such centres in pahses,” he said, adding that this experiment would continue for a period of three months. While first-line ART costs Rs 6,500 per year for each patient, the second line is more than four times costlier at Rs 28,500. In an affidavit before the SC, NACO had said second-line ART for HIV patients could not be extended to those who had received “irrational treatment” from private medical practitioners. "

Customers have stopped coming to Shekhar's tea stall, wife Sangeeta lost her job as an assistant cook in the local school and their three sons are being shunned by classmates and teachers. All because government officials didn't maintain confidentiality about the family's HIV status in the central government's Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) scheme. In this scheme, HIV families get foodgrains at subsidized rates from the food &amp; civil supplies department. After officials revealed their medical condition to villagers about three months ago, the family of Shekhar has been ostracized. ""It all began when the sanction letter of the AAY card reached the gram panchayat. Two days later, GP members met with school development managing committee members and the headmaster told me not to come to work from the next day,"" Sangeeta told STOI. Shekhar said, ""We were happy despite our problem. We've known about our disease for about one-and-a-half years but never told anyone about it. After that letter, my sons were not even allowed to drink water from the school tap."" Shekhar asked the authorities why their personal details were disclosed. The couple even considered committing suicide, but timely intervention of NGOs gave them hope. A senior officer of the food and civil supplies department said, ""It's possible the tahsildar inadvertently sent the sanction letters to the gram panchayat. We'll look into the issue,"" he added. Raghavendra T, deputy director, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust, said, ""It's a clear violation of human rights. Nobody can breach confidentiality, particularly in such cases."" Deputy commissioner Ekroop Kaur said, ""It's a serious issue and I'll issue a directive to all offices to avoid such mistakes. I'll also try to ensure Sangeeta gets her job back, if she wants it."" "

The children, aged between three and 12 years, were denied admission to a prominent school in Gurgaon last year on ‘medical grounds’ and even the government school they have been shifted to is threatening to remove them as they are HIV positive. The NGO looking after them has alleged that the kids are treated poorly at their school and are mocked at by fellow children. “The students call us ‘bimari’. Even the teachers do not help. They often scold us and make us work,” said 12-year-old Amit (name changed), who studies in Class VI at Rajkiya Vidyalaya in Bhondsi, Haryana. Another 11-year-old child, who has no memories of his parents or where he was born, says teachers discriminate against him. “They make us clean the classroom, do gardening work and often scold us. They ask us why we keep taking medicines and beat us up if we protest,” he alleged, adding that he has no illness and is healthy like any other child. According to Sunita Gupta, chairperson of NGO Drone Foundation which looks after these children, the teacher in-charge of the government-run school has warned of action if a medical certificate is not produced at the earliest. “The children feel scared to go to school. I met the principal some days ago and he threatened disciplinary action as the school was not informed about the fact that these children were HIV positive. They are being harassed,” she claimed. Gupta added that the children, who were orphaned, were first registered under the education program for underprivileged children run by DPS Maruti Kunj in March 2009. “Though the school administration was supportive in the beginning, due to pressure from parents of other children and teachers, they asked us to make alternate arrangement for their education in August. One academic year was lost as all other schools had closed admissions by then,” she said. When contacted, principal of DPS Maruti Kunj Rachna Pandit said that the children were never admitted to the school. “Such children need special care. We talked to doctors and experts about their emergency needs and care, and finally decided to drop them as we do not have expertise in dealing with such cases. There have been instances when these children got hurt while playing and the bleeding did not stop,” said Pandit. On the allegations of discrimination at the government school, Gurgaon’s district education officer Jyoti Choudhary said she was not aware of this case. “Under the Right to Education Act, no children can be discriminated against,” she said. Dr Bir Singh, professor of the community medicine department at AIIMS who has worked with Unicef, said that HIV positive children do not require any special care in schools. “They are healthy and need regular medication, including vitamins and tablets, to prevent opportunistic infections,” he said. The NGO looking after them has alleged that the kids are treated very badly at the govt school they are studying in and are mocked by others. "

These children, between 7 and 11 years, were taken on a visit to several places in the city by the NGO ‘RAYS-Ashi Ke Kiran’. For Ravi (name changed), it was an an unforgettable experience to spend the entire day playing with his close friends. “I enjoyed every moment of this day. I wish this day should come once in every month.” All these children live in a home for children with AIDS in Shyamnagar. Some of them were abandoned by their parents who could not afford the treatment cost, while a few children’s parents had died due to AIDS. All of them belong to different parts of the state. “This programme was planned to educate people about the disease that does not spread by sharing food or shaking hands with someone. These children need love and care from the civil society,” said Apra Khuchhal, organisation’s treasurer. Earlier during the day, they were invited by a ladies club. The children were gifted tiffin boxes, books, school bags, pens, blankets and chocolates. In keeping with the festive tradition, they sang carols and decorated the Christmas tree. “The biggest challenge is to sensitise people against discrimination of HIV-positive children,” said Khuchhal. Many schools celebrated the festival with the neglected and unprivileged sections of the society. Vice-principal of St Xavier’s School CK Punnose along with a team of volunteers distributed gifts at an old age home in the city. “We organise this programme every year aiming to spread love and affection.” The school had also invited poor children to spend the day on the campus. Another NGO Pravah Jaipur, which works for youth development and active citizenship celebrated the day with rags pickers. The NGO held a talk show on how to bring these sections of the society in to the mainstream. Meenakshi Bhanjbeo, director at Pravah Jaipur said, “Thousands of children in our state are engaged in menial jobs. We want to give them attention and nurture them properly.” "

Health professionals would be appropriate for such educational programmes for adolescents rather than their own teachers. Family life education should be incorporated in the school curriculum. These are some of the suggestions received by the HIV\AIDS education programmers of Nehru Yuva Kendra from at least 800 adolescent (10-19 years) boys and girls' students from the UT villages and slums. One of the senior study programmer Avnish Jolly said,""Teachers themselves expressed their reservations about discussing such topics with their students."" The results of the study suggest that health education can play a major role in improving the knowledge and attitude of the adolescent girls with reference to reproductive health, including HIV\AIDS. The study results further suggested that there is a need for evolving information, education and communication strategies to focus on raising awareness on adolescent reproductive health. Nehru Yuva Kendra’s district youth co-ordinator, GS Bajwa said,""The objectives of the study were two-fold. Firstly to assess the knowledge of adolescent girls regarding cause, transmission and prevention of STIs including HIV\AIDS. Secondly to study the effect of health education programmes in terms of improvement of knowledge and change in their attitude."" Jolly informed students? response rate was 98 % and though they had good knowledge regarding modes of transmission, they had some misconceptions about its spreading and this significantly improved after the intervention. ?It was observed the girls had a reasonably good knowledge regarding HIV\AIDS even before their intervention. This is probably due to better literacy rate in the area, despite being rural in setting. "
